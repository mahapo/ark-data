00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.786 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.655 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:23.857 align:middle line:84%
We are coming to you live
from the Gaiam studios

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.459 align:middle line:90%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.794 align:middle line:84%
And since this is a
live, interactive show,

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.363 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
communicate with us

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.031 align:middle line:90%
via Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.066 align:middle line:84%
Keep the conversation
going and the communication

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:90%
going throughout the show.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.135 align:middle line:84%
Many of you already
have done that.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.136 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:38.505 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to your comments
later on in the show.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.941 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you, for
those people who have ever

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:43.377 align:middle line:84%
had a dream about
an event happening

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:46.847 align:middle line:84%
and then it actually occurs,
listen very carefully.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.816 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who have
ever had a coincidence where

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.352 align:middle line:84%
you've thought of someone and
then they call, or you thought

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.621 align:middle line:84%
of an event and it
actually happens,

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.291 align:middle line:84%
then it may not
be a coincidence.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.226 align:middle line:90%
It may be a premonition.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.062 align:middle line:84%
And there is science
behind this concept.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.364 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is Dr. Larry Dossey.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:06.233 align:middle line:84%
He is responsible
for changing the way

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.735 align:middle line:84%
that the medical
profession relates

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.839 align:middle line:84%
to the concept of prayer,
and the scientific validation

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.741 align:middle line:84%
of prayer, in the
medical profession.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.944 align:middle line:84%
He is joining me today to
talk about the cutting edge

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:19.246 align:middle line:84%
science behind his
latest book, called

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.315 align:middle line:90%
The Power of Premonitions.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.149 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.383 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.418 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY DOSSEY:
Wouldn't miss it.

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:24.851 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:25.485 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.621 align:middle line:84%
So what you have done
with-- first of all,

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
you're a doctor of
internal medicine.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.327 align:middle line:84%
And you started writing
about healing and prayer

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.261 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago.

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.596 align:middle line:84%
This book is in
its 20th year now.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:39.866 align:middle line:84%
How did the medical profession
receive that information

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.567 align:middle line:90%
from you?

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.502 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I think
it was sort of a shock

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:47.774 align:middle line:84%
to them to begin with, but
they got over it very quickly.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.944 align:middle line:84%
The reason, Lisa, is
that it became obvious,

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.213 align:middle line:84%
from the information
in the book,

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:56.984 align:middle line:84%
that, as you've already said,
there really is science here.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:58.485 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people thought we

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.654 align:middle line:84%
were trying to sell
religion with the book.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:03.357 align:middle line:84%
And when they discovered
that wasn't the case,

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:05.559 align:middle line:84%
we were just trying
to do good science,

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.394 align:middle line:84%
then interesting things
started happening.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.162 align:middle line:84%
People started
doing more research.

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:11.064 align:middle line:84%
The medical schools
came on board

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:14.134 align:middle line:84%
and started emphasizing the
connection between spirituality

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:14.634 align:middle line:90%
and health.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we were off
to the races, really.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.973 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Dr Dossey's
book is in many,

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.141 align:middle line:90%
many of the medical schools.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.844 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, out
of the 128 medical schools,

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:28.081 align:middle line:84%
there's-- how many teach
alternative healing, actually?

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.583 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Actually,
about 90 of them

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:31.752 align:middle line:84%
have formal places
in the curriculum

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:33.387 align:middle line:90%
for this sort of information.

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:33.887 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:35.489 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY DOSSEY: This
is a real change.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.524 align:middle line:84%
Because back when
the book was written,

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.327 align:middle line:84%
in 1993, only three
medical schools

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.362 align:middle line:90%
would even touch this topic.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:45.732 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you come out
with a book on premonitions.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.135 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
started on that topic?

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:51.371 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I had a few
of those suckers myself.

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:54.574 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the first year I
was in medical school-- excuse

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:58.211 align:middle line:84%
me, the first year I was
in medical practice--

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:02.182 align:middle line:84%
I had a series of what are
called precognitive dreams.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.719 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were so
camera-like in detail about

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.954 align:middle line:84%
what would happen
the next day, I

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:11.091 align:middle line:84%
was just really
actually unnerved.

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:13.093 align:middle line:84%
The reason I was
is because I'd been

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.428 align:middle line:90%
taught that this doesn't happen.

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:16.797 align:middle line:84%
The world does not
behave like that.

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:18.832 align:middle line:84%
You can't know something
before it happens.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:20.267 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did
you know it wasn't

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:23.904 align:middle line:84%
an accident or
just foreshadowing?

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:26.406 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Because
of several reasons.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:29.776 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, the dream
was so odd and complex

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:33.579 align:middle line:84%
and detailed I couldn't have
made it up if I had tried.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.286 align:middle line:84%
And then, when it came true
the next day in exotic detail--

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:40.754 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have
to tell the story.

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:42.856 align:middle line:90%
I yeah-- I need to know.

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:45.425 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.795 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I dreamt
a series of events

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:51.098 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with the
three-year-old son of one

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:57.304 align:middle line:84%
of my colleagues at the
Dallas Diagnostic Association.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:01.842 align:middle line:84%
I dreamt that this young man
had a medical test the next day.

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:06.246 align:middle line:84%
He was lying on a
sterile-looking examination

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.247 align:middle line:90%
table.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:84%
A technician at the
head of the table

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.185 align:middle line:84%
was trying to do
some sort of test.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:90%
It looked like an EEG.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.124 align:middle line:84%
She had things she was trying
to paste onto his skull,

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:18.158 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:21.228 align:middle line:84%
The mother was standing
by the side of the kid,

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:25.098 align:middle line:84%
trying to lend comfort, because
this kid wasn't buying it.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.734 align:middle line:84%
He just went berserk--
crying, screaming, kicking.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.136 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This was
all in the dream?

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:30.871 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: This was
all in the dream.

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.406 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
technician just got fed up.

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:34.407 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I quit.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.076 align:middle line:90%
She turns around and walks away.

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:37.644 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
is a crazy dream.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:38.612 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you ever
think, why are you

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.013 align:middle line:90%
dreaming about this boy?

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:43.984 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yes, I woke up and
I actually had the sensation

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
that, gee, this feels like
the most vivid dream I've ever

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.854 align:middle line:90%
had in my life.

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.789 align:middle line:84%
Which didn't make
any sense, either.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.057 align:middle line:90%
So I go to work the next day.

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:54.427 align:middle line:84%
I make hospital rounds,
seeing patients in the office.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:59.799 align:middle line:84%
And at lunch, I'm sitting with
the boy's father, my colleague.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:00.901 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your colleague, OK.

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:04.004 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: In walks his wife,
holding this little boy

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:04.638 align:middle line:90%
in her arms.

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:05.972 align:middle line:90%
His head is wet.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.274 align:middle line:90%
He's crying.

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:09.142 align:middle line:90%
And he's very upset.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:13.079 align:middle line:84%
So she tells her
husband my dream,

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:16.283 align:middle line:84%
how they'd just come
from the EEG laboratory.

00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:17.984 align:middle line:90%
They tried to do the test.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.687 align:middle line:84%
The technician, although
she was famous for being

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:23.924 align:middle line:84%
able to do these
tests on children,

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.526 align:middle line:84%
nonetheless she just got fed
up with it and she just said,

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:27.928 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:28.929 align:middle line:90%
She quits.

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.097 align:middle line:84%
The mother's standing
there by the side.

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:34.734 align:middle line:84%
Now, a skeptic would say,
well it was just coincidence.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:36.069 align:middle line:90%
I can't buy it.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.305 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you ever figure
out why you had the dream?

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.472 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: No, not at all.

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, you just had it.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.008 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yes, and--

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There was no
significant meaning behind it.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:46.546 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
when you shared that?

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:48.648 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: When the wife
left with the little boy,

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:51.183 align:middle line:84%
I turned to my colleague
and I said, could I

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:53.086 align:middle line:90%
have known what just happened?

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:56.056 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
like, of course not.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.057 align:middle line:90%
That's silly.

00:05:57.057 --> 00:06:00.093 align:middle line:90%
Then I revealed to him my dream.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:02.362 align:middle line:90%
He was disturbed by that.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.598 align:middle line:84%
He, like I, knew that
this couldn't happen.

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:05.765 align:middle line:90%
But there it was.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.467 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what led
you into eventually

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:08.735 align:middle line:90%
writing a book about it?

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.804 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning
for you, right?

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:12.072 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, several things.

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:15.175 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, I found that I
could not avoid premonitions.

00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:18.411 align:middle line:84%
My patients began to
come to me telling me

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:21.848 align:middle line:84%
their dreams, which
would prove to be true.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.818 align:middle line:84%
Nurses discovered that I
had an interest in this

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:28.388 align:middle line:84%
and flooded me with
their premonitions.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.191 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, doctors began
to tell me their experiences,

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.492 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:34.594 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to hide from
them, but I couldn't.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.329 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was like
when you allowed that

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:39.399 align:middle line:84%
into your consciousness,
it started to attract.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.134 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: That's a
great way to put it.

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:42.836 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
crucial development

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:46.406 align:middle line:84%
which was pivotal
in writing the book.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:51.244 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, very talented
investigators-- scientists--

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:54.714 align:middle line:84%
began to do experiments
determining whether or not

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:56.783 align:middle line:90%
people could sense the future.

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.986 align:middle line:84%
These were called
presentiment studies.

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:01.955 align:middle line:90%
They're computer-based studies.

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dean Radin is
one of the people

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.825 align:middle line:90%
who pioneered that field.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:09.396 align:middle line:84%
And beyond any question,
any shadow of doubt,

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:11.898 align:middle line:84%
he and others proved
that people can

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:14.034 align:middle line:84%
sense what's coming
up into the future.

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:16.269 align:middle line:84%
You can't fool these
computer-based experiments.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.637 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do
you do those types

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:18.972 align:middle line:90%
of experiments computer based?

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.674 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, it's
quite interesting.

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:23.209 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you get hooked
up to have something measured

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.778 align:middle line:84%
in your body, like
your blood pressure

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:29.949 align:middle line:84%
or pulse rate-- something of
that sort, one of the stress

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.751 align:middle line:90%
measures in the body.

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:35.488 align:middle line:84%
And so the computer is
going to show you an image.

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be one of two types.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.392 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
a horrible image,

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:42.862 align:middle line:84%
like an autopsy or a grisly
car wreck, something like this.

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:45.632 align:middle line:84%
Or it's going to be a
peaceful, serene image,

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:49.202 align:middle line:84%
like a scene at the beach or in
nature, something of that sort.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:51.404 align:middle line:84%
You don't know which
it's going to be.

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:53.573 align:middle line:84%
The computer doesn't
know, because the computer

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:56.643 align:middle line:84%
is going to make a
random choice about what

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:57.744 align:middle line:90%
it's going to show you.

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.546 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's what happens.

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.082 align:middle line:84%
If the image that the
computer's going to show you

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:05.885 align:middle line:84%
is one of these awful,
disturbing images,

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:09.556 align:middle line:84%
before it even shows it
to you, before it even

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:12.025 align:middle line:84%
selects the image,
your body begins

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:15.929 align:middle line:84%
to generate an exaggerated
stress response.

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Your blood pressure goes up.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.131 align:middle line:90%
Your heart rate goes up.

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:21.234 align:middle line:84%
Your pupils dilate--
before you even

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.636 align:middle line:84%
know what the image
is going to be.

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:25.839 align:middle line:84%
Before you're even
exposed to it.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.741 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't happen
to the same degree

00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:30.377 align:middle line:84%
if the image is going to be
one of those peaceful things.

00:08:30.377 --> 00:08:35.148 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how
in the world do you know--

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:36.515 align:middle line:90%
how does your body know--

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How does it know?

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.618 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --what's going
to happen in the future?

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:40.653 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But the fact that it
does know-- we don't know how--

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:41.654 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:42.588 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --other than--

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:46.826 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It's getting
information from the future.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:49.396 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call a
premonition, essentially.

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:53.366 align:middle line:84%
The body knows something
that hasn't happened yet.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.435 align:middle line:84%
These studies have been
replicated by researchers

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:56.569 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:58.204 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm sure our
viewers can relate

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.406 align:middle line:90%
with this as they're talking.

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:01.875 align:middle line:84%
If you have had these
types of premonitions,

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.076 align:middle line:90%
let us know via Facebook.

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:05.478 align:middle line:84%
It'd be interesting to get
the feedback from the viewers.

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:08.047 align:middle line:84%
This has apparently been spoken
about in ancient history.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:10.316 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of
prophecy about this.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.484 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, exactly.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.653 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
that premonitions are just

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.289 align:middle line:84%
kind of a modern kind of a
deal, but in the Old Testament

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:19.926 align:middle line:90%
they were called prophecy.

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:22.495 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism goes back
for 50,000 years.

00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:28.368 align:middle line:84%
And any decent shaman had
powers of foreknowledge,

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:31.638 align:middle line:84%
knowing where the enemy would
be, where game was located--

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:32.539 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, of course.

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:32.705 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.974 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --where shelter
was, and this sort of thing.

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:38.111 align:middle line:84%
So this has been part
of the human legacy

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:90%
for at least 50,000 years.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.449 align:middle line:84%
And it's only in the
past few hundred years

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:45.118 align:middle line:84%
that we've disowned this
and said it's impossible,

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.586 align:middle line:90%
can't happen.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.855 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do the scientists
say about the studies

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:84%
by Dean Radin, the quantum
entanglement studies?

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.564 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Actually, there's
a huge debate over them now.

00:09:57.564 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And a doctor named Daryl
Bem at Cornell University

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.171 align:middle line:90%
has done nine of these himself.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.407 align:middle line:90%
Eight of them came out positive.

00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:08.508 align:middle line:90%
And it's just thrown--

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:09.342 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.811 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --it's just thrown
the skeptics for a loop.

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts of
arguments about this.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.714 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:17.383 align:middle line:84%
Well, apparently
science has attempted

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.085 align:middle line:84%
to prove it many,
many different ways.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We have a slide here
that shows that.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.888 align:middle line:90%
What's the story behind that?

00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:23.423 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, the
story behind that

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:26.359 align:middle line:84%
is that that was
one of my patients

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:31.064 align:middle line:84%
who was a well known
attorney in Dallas.

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
She came, knocked on my door
one morning, and she said,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.868 align:middle line:90%
I'm scared to death.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.672 align:middle line:84%
Her story was that she
had had a dream the night

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:42.375 align:middle line:84%
before that she
had, as she said,

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:46.446 align:middle line:84%
three little white
spots on her left ovary.

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:49.582 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I know
I've got ovarian cancer.

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.717 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just terrified.

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:51.684 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Out of the blue?

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.319 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Out of the blue.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.054 align:middle line:90%
So I did a pelvic examination.

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:56.356 align:middle line:90%
It was completely normal.

00:10:56.356 --> 00:11:03.162 align:middle line:84%
We decided to do a sonogram to
resolve her fears and anxiety.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
the sonogram reports

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.272 align:middle line:84%
showed that she had three little
white spots on her left ovary,

00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:13.473 align:middle line:90%
just as she had dreamt.

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:16.142 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this was a
picture of that sonogram?

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:17.744 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: That's not
the specific one,

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:21.214 align:middle line:84%
but this is one just for
illustrative purposes,

00:11:21.214 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:90%
showing a sonogram.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:22.248 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:23.249 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:26.185 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: But she had no
business knowing this.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.354 align:middle line:90%
She had no symptoms whatsoever.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:30.823 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't the only one.

00:11:30.823 --> 00:11:35.995 align:middle line:84%
Other equally interesting
and unlikely reports

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:40.967 align:middle line:84%
of premonitions begin to
filter in from other people.

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:44.637 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that
the nurses and the doctors--

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:48.641 align:middle line:84%
the nurses tend to have the
premonitions-- I wouldn't say

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:53.212 align:middle line:84%
more than the doctors, but that
they tend to report them more?

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:54.113 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Absolutely.

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:54.747 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:58.851 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: My wife Barbara is
a cardiovascular and holistic

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:02.255 align:middle line:84%
nurse, and I've lived
with stories of nurses

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:04.457 align:middle line:84%
and their premonitions
for 40 years.

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:08.194 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, I don't
know of any profession that

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:11.931 align:middle line:84%
is more premonition
prone than nurses.

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:15.435 align:middle line:84%
They spend their professional
lives at the bedside,

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.437 align:middle line:84%
developing some sort
of intuitive skill

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:19.606 align:middle line:90%
that just eludes doctors.

00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:21.107 align:middle line:84%
And they're not as
reluctant to talk

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.176 align:middle line:90%
about it as physicians are.

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:26.512 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so they do have
more of maybe a relationship

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:30.783 align:middle line:84%
with these people in a--
maybe that's what creates it.

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.518 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
relationship with someone,

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.721 align:middle line:90%
is the premonition heightened?

00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:36.623 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think that
that's exactly right.

00:12:36.623 --> 00:12:38.324 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Has that been proven?

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:39.058 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yes.

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.961 align:middle line:84%
People who have intimate
relations with other people

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:45.698 align:middle line:84%
tend to be on their wavelength
more and are able, I think,

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:49.669 align:middle line:84%
to acquire premonition-type
experiences.

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:51.404 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:57.176 align:middle line:84%
And we physicians are terribly
left brained, analytical,

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.113 align:middle line:84%
and logical and all
this sort of thing.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.881 align:middle line:90%
And we take pride in that.

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:04.884 align:middle line:84%
I think nurses have a more
general way of knowing.

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:09.389 align:middle line:84%
They're not locked into their
intellectual ability, which

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:12.425 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really help
you have premonition.

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:15.228 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe more
permission for having

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:16.729 align:middle line:90%
that kind of a conversation.

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:19.065 align:middle line:84%
So has the science
of premonitions

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:23.136 align:middle line:84%
reached its way into
the medical community?

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:24.837 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think it's
always been there.

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:26.973 align:middle line:84%
I just think that
doctors have been

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.876 align:middle line:84%
really shy about
talking about it.

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:32.211 align:middle line:84%
Just as an example, when
I was in medical school,

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:35.081 align:middle line:84%
I had a couple of
professors who were

00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:39.419 align:middle line:84%
able to make these uncanny
diagnoses in ways I just simply

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:40.253 align:middle line:90%
couldn't figure out.

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:43.623 align:middle line:84%
And when I would ask them
how they made the diagnosis

00:13:43.623 --> 00:13:45.758 align:middle line:84%
in a particular
case, one of them

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:47.193 align:middle line:90%
was simply unable to explain.

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:50.463 align:middle line:84%
He just sort of laughed it
off and he said, oh, it's

00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:51.631 align:middle line:90%
just a matter of experience.

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:58.004 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, the really good
doctors or practitioners I know

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:00.073 align:middle line:90%
are amazing diagnosticians.

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:01.174 align:middle line:90%
And that's probably why.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.176 align:middle line:84%
They're connected
to their intuition.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:06.746 align:middle line:84%
And it goes against the
conventional medical view,

00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:08.848 align:middle line:90%
that was what?

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.583 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well it's
that you just have

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:11.784 align:middle line:90%
to reason through the facts.

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:15.521 align:middle line:84%
You have to do an examination,
take a history, do the test,

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.758 align:middle line:84%
and put the pieces together
in a logical order.

00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:20.893 align:middle line:84%
Well, premonitions aren't
about going from point A

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.529 align:middle line:84%
to point B to point C.
They're like jumping from A

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:28.735 align:middle line:84%
to Z without any intervening
logical, analytical framework.

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:31.704 align:middle line:84%
And I think that makes a lot
of intellectually-oriented

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:90%
physicians really nervous.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:39.045 align:middle line:84%
Because we're trained that that
is not the right way to do it.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, it
does take away all

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.582 align:middle line:84%
of the training, the medical
school, and so forth.

00:14:42.582 --> 00:14:45.051 align:middle line:84%
But as we see here, that
the conventional view is

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.553 align:middle line:84%
that the mind is
confined to the brain.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.123 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing outside
of that mind, right?

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Right.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.227 align:middle line:84%
And so premonitions suggest
that there is something outside.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.094 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:57.296 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: You can know
something without putting

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:59.932 align:middle line:84%
the pieces together
intellectually

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:01.367 align:middle line:90%
and analytically.

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:04.971 align:middle line:84%
And also, one reason that we
say you can't have a premonition

00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:07.573 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
way we view time.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:11.878 align:middle line:84%
We say time flows like a river
from the past into the present

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:13.513 align:middle line:90%
and into the future.

00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:16.048 align:middle line:84%
And a premonition suggests
that well, maybe time

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:18.985 align:middle line:84%
might come back
in this direction,

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:21.354 align:middle line:84%
bringing information
from the future

00:15:21.354 --> 00:15:25.358 align:middle line:84%
into the present, which you
might sense as a premonition.

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:26.893 align:middle line:90%
We know that can't happen.

00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:27.994 align:middle line:90%
Time can't flow backwards.

00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:29.562 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The river
can't flow back up.

00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:30.363 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Flow
backwards-- exactly.

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:31.364 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:33.266 align:middle line:84%
However, there has
been science then

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:37.003 align:middle line:84%
that has proven that
premonitions are possible.

00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:38.037 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:41.073 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there
are several efforts

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:47.513 align:middle line:84%
in physics now to develop
models of time which

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.182 align:middle line:90%
are premonition friendly.

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:51.951 align:middle line:84%
In physics this is
called retrocausation.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.188 align:middle line:84%
And this is a hot
topic in physics.

00:15:55.188 --> 00:15:59.759 align:middle line:84%
And it presents a model that's
cordial to having premonitions.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:02.328 align:middle line:84%
There are several ways
that they talk about this.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:05.398 align:middle line:84%
One is that there may
be a block universe.

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:06.699 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's a block universe?

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.367 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: A block
universe is a universe

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:11.571 align:middle line:84%
in which everything that
has happened or will happen

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:15.041 align:middle line:90%
has already-- already exists.

00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:18.578 align:middle line:84%
And if this is so, if that
information of future events

00:16:18.578 --> 00:16:20.279 align:middle line:84%
has already happened,
then it might

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:22.882 align:middle line:84%
be possible for consciousness
to acquire information

00:16:22.882 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle line:84%
about that, which you would
experience as a premonition.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.187 align:middle line:90%
Another-- I know this is weird--

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:30.056 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, no, no, no, no--
this is very interesting to me.

00:16:30.056 --> 00:16:31.324 align:middle line:90%
This is extremely interesting.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.392 align:middle line:84%
So, there's so much that
goes along with this.

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:37.296 align:middle line:84%
So this essentially suggests, in
the theory of quantum physics,

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:41.167 align:middle line:84%
that there can be parallel
universes, future universes--

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.235 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Retrocausation.

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:44.036 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Retrocausation.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:45.271 align:middle line:90%
And this has been proven?

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:46.305 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, this is--

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How you can
possibly prove that.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.241 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
these are hypotheses.

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:49.342 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.978 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And Lord knows
which one will eventually

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:53.746 align:middle line:90%
float to the top, if any.

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:56.148 align:middle line:84%
But this is taken
very seriously.

00:16:56.148 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle line:84%
Now is not just a philosophical
plaything for physicists.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.788 align:middle line:84%
They are dead serious
about these possibilities.

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:07.425 align:middle line:84%
And another is what physicists
call closed timelike loops,

00:17:07.425 --> 00:17:10.061 align:middle line:84%
in which time might circle
back from the future

00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:12.698 align:middle line:84%
into the present, bringing
future information

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:16.335 align:middle line:84%
into the present that you might
experience as a premonition.

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:20.172 align:middle line:84%
This is taken dead
seriously by physicists.

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
So there are models that permit
premonitions on the horizon.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:27.914 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:17:27.914 --> 00:17:29.215 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait for that.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Does this explain
a deja vu, maybe?

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.286 align:middle line:84%
Facebook listeners are
asking that question.

00:17:33.286 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, sure.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.724 align:middle line:84%
Deja vu is a sense
that something

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
that-- you're
experiencing something

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.161 align:middle line:90%
that has already happened.

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And the model of
the block universe

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:50.403 align:middle line:84%
is certainly one way to
accommodate that sort of thing.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.272 align:middle line:84%
Premonitions are a sense
of what will happen.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:56.108 align:middle line:84%
Deja vu is a sense that
what you're experiencing

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:57.977 align:middle line:90%
has already happened.

00:17:57.977 --> 00:18:01.247 align:middle line:84%
But in a block
universe, the phenomena

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.915 align:middle line:90%
seem to be very related.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:03.916 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.351 align:middle line:84%
One of the other
Facebook listeners

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:07.753 align:middle line:84%
was asking if that
could create healing,

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.823 align:middle line:84%
if they could create
healing with premonitions.

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.024 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:15.962 align:middle line:84%
Nicole says, how can the power
of thought affect your health?

00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:18.264 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I'm thinking,
I don't feel so well today.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.999 align:middle line:84%
So does that encourage low
energy and poor health?

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:22.034 align:middle line:90%
Can it be used like that?

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:24.971 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, here's
one way that premonitions

00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:27.506 align:middle line:84%
might be of value
in creating health.

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:29.809 align:middle line:84%
And I think this gets
played out in real life.

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:34.013 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a
premonition that you're

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:36.782 align:middle line:84%
going to have an automobile
accident tomorrow-- not so good

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.484 align:middle line:90%
for your health.

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we believe
about premonitions

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
is that if you
have one like that,

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.827 align:middle line:84%
that auto accident is
not written in stone.

00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
It is not certain that
that has to happen.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.867 align:middle line:84%
We talk about a
probabilistic future.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:59.638 align:middle line:84%
That auto accident may indeed
be probable, and statistically

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.174 align:middle line:84%
likely, but you can
shift statistics.

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:05.644 align:middle line:84%
You can shift probabilities by
taking action in the present.

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:08.347 align:middle line:84%
So you might be doubly careful
tomorrow when you go out

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:12.084 align:middle line:84%
and drive and
eliminate that event

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:14.153 align:middle line:90%
from happening in your life.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:18.758 align:middle line:84%
I think that gets played out
all the time in people's lives.

00:19:18.758 --> 00:19:19.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so interesting.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.961 align:middle line:84%
So if there is this
block universe,

00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:24.497 align:middle line:84%
and if you can
essentially connect

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:26.632 align:middle line:84%
through a premonition to
something that has already

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:30.703 align:middle line:84%
happened, and possibly
connect to the back-- what

00:19:30.703 --> 00:19:35.708 align:middle line:84%
has happened in the past, then
can you not create the future?

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:37.877 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I think
that's exactly right.

00:19:37.877 --> 00:19:40.446 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is one reason why

00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:42.782 align:middle line:84%
we should be talking
about premonitions.

00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think that if you

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.152 align:middle line:84%
have a premonition that
something horrible is

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:48.254 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:50.222 align:middle line:84%
It's going to happen,
and you're just

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:53.459 align:middle line:84%
getting a preview of
something terrible.

00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:55.594 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's only
one part of it.

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:57.897 align:middle line:84%
The good part of it
is that this idea

00:19:57.897 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
of the probabilistic
future that can be changed.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It's trivial to say, I think
these days, as many people do,

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.305 align:middle line:84%
that you create
your own reality.

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:08.274 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure you
create all of it.

00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:12.278 align:middle line:84%
But I know this-- the data
suggests very strongly that you

00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:15.014 align:middle line:84%
can influence it and
shift the probability

00:20:15.014 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
from a horrible future
into one that's benign.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.586 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, we can
talk about preventing

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.021 align:middle line:90%
horrible things happening to us.

00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:22.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:24.557 align:middle line:84%
So there's an
interesting statistic

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.726 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about
the airplanes that

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.362 align:middle line:84%
went into the World
Trade Center on 9/11.

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:32.164 align:middle line:90%
Can you share that with us?

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:33.532 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
I think Americans

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:39.205 align:middle line:84%
have some very erroneous ideas
about what happened on 9/11.

00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:40.372 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I was one of them.

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:45.744 align:middle line:84%
I think many of us think that
four jam-packed commercial jets

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:50.783 align:middle line:90%
flew into the towers or crashed.

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:53.552 align:middle line:90%
And that simply wasn't the case.

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:58.224 align:middle line:90%
Those planes were 79% empty.

00:20:58.224 --> 00:20:59.492 align:middle line:90%
This is public knowledge, this.

00:20:59.492 --> 00:21:00.426 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who knew that?

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.528 align:middle line:90%
They were 79% empty?

00:21:02.528 --> 00:21:03.929 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's exactly right.

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:07.433 align:middle line:84%
One of the plains
was only 16% full.

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:10.836 align:middle line:84%
None of them were
more than half full.

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:13.806 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
fascinating statistic

00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that takes most people by
surprise, as it did me.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.779 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I didn't believe this
when I found the statistics.

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:23.916 align:middle line:84%
But it's in the
congressional 9/11 report.

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:26.418 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can look up these
statistics for themselves.

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:30.489 align:middle line:84%
And so it leads you to ask,
why were those planes so empty?

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:32.024 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:35.027 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It would appear on
the surface that a lot of people

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:38.597 align:middle line:84%
found some reason not
to travel that day.

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:40.099 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Actually,
Gina, the producer

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:42.301 align:middle line:84%
of the show, shared with
me three stories of three

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.736 align:middle line:84%
friends of hers
that were supposed

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:47.239 align:middle line:84%
to have been in that building
that day, that kids sick,

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:50.376 align:middle line:84%
or something else
happened, or different part

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:51.277 align:middle line:90%
of town, randomly.

00:21:51.277 --> 00:21:52.945 align:middle line:84%
They were all
supposed to be there.

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:90%
She knows three of them.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.517 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, here's something
else that I'm fascinated by.

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:04.623 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to people who
have cancelled their flights,

00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:07.459 align:middle line:84%
or rearranged their schedules,
and then the plane went

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:11.664 align:middle line:84%
on to crash, almost never
will those people say,

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:14.466 align:middle line:84%
I had a premonition
of a plane crash.

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:17.603 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
unconscious comes in, I think.

00:22:17.603 --> 00:22:22.775 align:middle line:84%
What people will say is, I
don't know why I cancelled it.

00:22:22.775 --> 00:22:27.346 align:middle line:84%
I just had a feeling that I
just should not fly that day.

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:29.248 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't feel
right about it.

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or events like
a child gets sick,

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.384 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:35.054 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that all plays into
the whole idea of premonitions?

00:22:35.054 --> 00:22:36.522 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Absolutely.

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How could you--

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.061 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think that this is
largely an unconscious process.

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:44.563 align:middle line:84%
What I think is going
on-- this is an idea

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:47.466 align:middle line:84%
that's been put forward by a
cognitive psychologist, Dr.

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:53.606 align:middle line:84%
James Carpenter-- he says that
these premonitions work very

00:22:53.606 --> 00:22:57.543 align:middle line:84%
subtly in our lives, usually at
the subconscious or unconscious

00:22:57.543 --> 00:23:00.212 align:middle line:84%
level, as there's a
lot of evidence for.

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:04.316 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we ought to stop
calling this second sight.

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:08.053 align:middle line:84%
Generations ago, this was called
second sight, in medieval times

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.154 align:middle line:90%
especially.

00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And he says we need to start
calling it first sight.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:12.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:14.793 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: He said because
this is so fundamental;

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:17.096 align:middle line:84%
it's even more
fundamental than vision.

00:23:17.096 --> 00:23:20.466 align:middle line:84%
And it operates off
the scene of awareness,

00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:22.034 align:middle line:90%
in the unconscious level.

00:23:22.034 --> 00:23:25.204 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we see people
canceling and rearranging

00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:29.508 align:middle line:84%
flights for reasons that
they're not totally sure about.

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:30.643 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:23:30.643 --> 00:23:31.844 align:middle line:90%
Right, it's very interesting.

00:23:31.844 --> 00:23:35.414 align:middle line:84%
We have some examples of how
some of these premonitions

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:37.082 align:middle line:90%
come true.

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:41.086 align:middle line:84%
There's agencies and there's
bureaus of premonitions.

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:42.187 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

00:23:42.187 --> 00:23:43.255 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.957 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I never knew that.

00:23:44.957 --> 00:23:46.525 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Few people do.

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:48.761 align:middle line:90%
But we can change that.

00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:49.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We are.

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:50.696 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: We are changing that.

00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:52.564 align:middle line:84%
I would like for
people to be aware

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:56.035 align:middle line:84%
that they could contribute
to the research in this field

00:23:56.035 --> 00:23:59.905 align:middle line:84%
by reporting premonitions
of things that

00:23:59.905 --> 00:24:02.608 align:middle line:84%
would be in the interest of
the nation to know about,

00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:07.913 align:middle line:84%
such as terrorist attacks,
airline crashes, tsunamis,

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.248 align:middle line:90%
earthquakes, and so on.

00:24:09.248 --> 00:24:10.749 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that why
the bureaus were

00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:11.583 align:middle line:90%
created in the first place?

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:12.751 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yes, that's right.

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:17.289 align:middle line:84%
The question is, if we were
to collect these premonitions

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:22.961 align:middle line:84%
and analyze it, could we predict
events which we would want

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:26.298 align:middle line:84%
to predict, that we
would want to prevent,

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.666 align:middle line:90%
such as a terrorist attack.

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:31.804 align:middle line:84%
So there's an organization
called the Arlington Institute.

00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:34.273 align:middle line:84%
It's a think tank that's
run by John Petersen, who

00:24:34.273 --> 00:24:37.443 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most gifted
futurist predictors

00:24:37.443 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.911 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:24:38.911 --> 00:24:43.148 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And so the website
is arlingtoninstitute.org.

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.618 align:middle line:84%
So viewers, if you
have a premonition

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:50.489 align:middle line:84%
you think needs to be
reported, log onto the website

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:52.624 align:middle line:90%
and enter your premonition.

00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:54.193 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Global
types of situations?

00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:55.994 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Global or local
events-- either one.

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:56.662 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And so
they have a team

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.666 align:middle line:84%
of analysts and statisticians
who analyze these things.

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:03.469 align:middle line:84%
And they call this
the whether map.

00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:07.206 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not a
weather map, like climate.

00:25:07.206 --> 00:25:08.874 align:middle line:90%
They want to know whether--

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:10.008 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or not this could--

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --whether or not these
things can be put to good use.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.583 align:middle line:84%
So people can make a nice
contribution to this research

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:18.317 align:middle line:90%
by doing this.

00:25:18.317 --> 00:25:19.718 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting,
interesting.

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:23.255 align:middle line:84%
Mark from Facebook is saying,
do premonitions most often

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:23.956 align:middle line:90%
come in dreams?

00:25:23.956 --> 00:25:25.424 align:middle line:84%
And how can you
tell the difference

00:25:25.424 --> 00:25:29.194 align:middle line:84%
between a premonition
and a regular dream?

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:32.664 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, premonitions
often come in dreams.

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:35.401 align:middle line:84%
It depends on how you want
to define a premonition.

00:25:35.401 --> 00:25:38.504 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call it
intuition, or gut feelings,

00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:40.739 align:middle line:84%
or a hunch, a lot
of that takes place

00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:43.308 align:middle line:90%
in ordinary waking awareness.

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:45.811 align:middle line:84%
But I must say that
those premonitions

00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:47.413 align:middle line:84%
sort of knock your
socks off, that

00:25:47.413 --> 00:25:53.819 align:middle line:84%
are really humdingers, complex--
about airlines crashing,

00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:56.054 align:middle line:84%
terrorist attacks, this sort
of thing-- those usually

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.489 align:middle line:90%
crop up in dreams.

00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:59.324 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:01.059 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And so what
was Mark's next--

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.629 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, how do you tell
the difference between--

00:26:03.629 --> 00:26:04.797 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: A regular dream?

00:26:04.797 --> 00:26:06.064 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A regular dream.

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:07.999 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there's
no 100% way to do this,

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:11.403 align:middle line:84%
but there are
criteria that we can

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:14.807 align:middle line:84%
use to separate
ordinary scary dreams--

00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:17.943 align:middle line:84%
this sort of thing-- or
nightmares, from the real deal.

00:26:17.943 --> 00:26:19.611 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: From what a
real premonition is.

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:20.512 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Shall
we go into those.

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:22.014 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, well actually we're
going to take a quick break.

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:23.015 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back, we're going

00:26:23.015 --> 00:26:25.017 align:middle line:84%
to go into how you can
use this information

00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:27.619 align:middle line:84%
in your everyday life, and
how you can practically

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:30.155 align:middle line:84%
use premonitions, how to
identify the difference

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:32.057 align:middle line:84%
between a premonition
and a dream.

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:34.893 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do that when we come
back with Doctor Larry Dossey.

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:37.996 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, and you're
watching "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:40.599 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned and stick with

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:41.934 align:middle line:90%

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:43.402 align:middle line:84%
I'll be reading them
when we come back.

00:26:46.305 --> 00:26:47.172 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Welcome back.

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:47.906 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:49.541 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:52.144 align:middle line:84%
And we continue
to ask you to talk

00:26:52.144 --> 00:26:53.512 align:middle line:84%
with us via Facebook
and Twitter.

00:26:53.512 --> 00:26:56.081 align:middle line:84%
We want to hear from
you about premonitions.

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:57.616 align:middle line:90%
My guest is Dr. Larry Dossey.

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.585 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
most interesting stories

00:26:59.585 --> 00:27:00.953 align:middle line:90%
that I've heard.

00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:03.388 align:middle line:84%
I had not heard this before,
about the Westside Baptist

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:04.556 align:middle line:90%
Church.

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:05.257 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:27:05.257 --> 00:27:06.191 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:11.864 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, on March 1,
1950, an event happened which

00:27:11.864 --> 00:27:14.366 align:middle line:84%
for a few days
electrified the country.

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:17.369 align:middle line:84%
This was written up
in Life Magazine.

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:19.705 align:middle line:84%
It captivated
people's attention.

00:27:19.705 --> 00:27:24.409 align:middle line:84%
What happened is that in this
little church in Southeastern

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Nebraska, little
town called Beatrice,

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.216 align:middle line:84%
there was a church, the
Westside Baptist Church.

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:33.685 align:middle line:84%
And the Westside Baptist
Church had a little choir.

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:35.287 align:middle line:90%
It had 15 members.

00:27:35.287 --> 00:27:40.526 align:middle line:84%
And they met every
Wednesday night at 7:20

00:27:40.526 --> 00:27:42.794 align:middle line:90%
for choir practice.

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:46.431 align:middle line:84%
Something really unusual
happened on that night.

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:50.035 align:middle line:90%
At 7:25 the church exploded.

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:52.571 align:middle line:84%
They determined later that
it was a natural gas leak.

00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:54.873 align:middle line:90%
But this demolished the church.

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:57.442 align:middle line:84%
It actually broke windows
all throughout town.

00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:59.077 align:middle line:84%
It knocked a little
radio station off.

00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:01.313 align:middle line:90%
This was a big time explosion.

00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:03.415 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that
no one was injured,

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:06.618 align:middle line:90%
because no one was there.

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:09.354 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in the
history of that church,

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:90%
there was a complete no show.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.125 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Nobody showed
up for choir practice?

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:14.259 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Nobody showed up.

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:15.694 align:middle line:90%
Nobody was hurt.

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:18.764 align:middle line:84%
And so word got out
around the country.

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:24.236 align:middle line:84%
And Beatrice was invaded by
investigators and statisticians

00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:29.074 align:middle line:84%
and people who recognized this
as just an extraordinary event.

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:36.148 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you ask these
people, as actually happened

00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:84%
by enterprising
reporters, why they

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:41.386 align:middle line:84%
didn't go to church
that night, nobody

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.388 align:middle line:84%
had a clue that the Church
was going to blow up.

00:28:43.388 --> 00:28:47.192 align:middle line:84%
This did not show up in the
form of premonitions or warnings

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:50.162 align:middle line:84%
or foreknowledge
at all in anybody.

00:28:50.162 --> 00:28:53.432 align:middle line:84%
And they all attributed
their absence

00:28:53.432 --> 00:28:55.767 align:middle line:90%
to ordinary, mundane happenings.

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.102 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were kind of funny.

00:28:57.102 --> 00:29:00.806 align:middle line:84%
One woman said she just fell
in love with her ironing

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:03.609 align:middle line:84%
and she just got carried
away with her ironing.

00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:04.443 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:07.412 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Two high school girls,
who were members of the choir,

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:09.915 align:middle line:84%
said they just fell in love
with doing their homework.

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:11.583 align:middle line:90%
I think that's kind of unusual.

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.585 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's not something
you hear every day.

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:14.252 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: That's right.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.388 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody had
a mundane reason,

00:29:16.388 --> 00:29:19.358 align:middle line:84%
but nobody had any
clue that a disaster

00:29:19.358 --> 00:29:21.226 align:middle line:90%
was in store for the church.

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.028 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
absolutely fascinating

00:29:23.028 --> 00:29:26.632 align:middle line:84%
because this shows
how these things work

00:29:26.632 --> 00:29:29.034 align:middle line:90%
at an unconscious level, often.

00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:32.137 align:middle line:84%
Even when big time disasters
are in your future,

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:34.139 align:middle line:84%
you don't always get a
clear picture of that.

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:36.008 align:middle line:84%
It's just a kind of a
little nudge, you know,

00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:39.778 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find other
excuses not to be there.

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:41.179 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
think this all has

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:44.950 align:middle line:84%
to do with this quantum
field of entanglement?

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.318 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think
entanglement is

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the best theories we
have going to explain this.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.993 align:middle line:84%
But I would be the first
to say that it's only

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.195 align:middle line:84%
honest to say we don't know
how this works right now.

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:59.464 align:middle line:84%
I love the idea of
closed time-like loops

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:02.668 align:middle line:84%
also, bringing information
from the future to the present

00:30:02.668 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that we would experience
as a premonition.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.471 align:middle line:84%
I don't know which
one of these things

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:09.574 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the going
hypothesis, eventually.

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:13.745 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we really
need to struggle with that, so

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:16.381 align:middle line:84%
much as we need to
simply recognize-- look,

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:18.183 align:middle line:90%
this is a fact of our lives.

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:21.053 align:middle line:84%
These things are
an absolute gift

00:30:21.053 --> 00:30:23.622 align:middle line:84%
that nature has
presented us with.

00:30:23.622 --> 00:30:28.527 align:middle line:84%
This ability to sense danger,
to avoid destruction and threats

00:30:28.527 --> 00:30:29.194 align:middle line:90%
to our health.

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:33.031 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there a place for
God in this conversation?

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:36.234 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well it's interesting
that if you asked the members

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.336 align:middle line:90%
of the Westside Baptist Church--

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.538 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sure.

00:30:39.538 --> 00:30:43.175 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --how this happened,
all of them said, God did it.

00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:44.042 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:45.644 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: I'm open to that.

00:30:45.644 --> 00:30:47.646 align:middle line:84%
The reason I don't
introduce God is

00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:50.849 align:middle line:84%
because science has no business
talking about the presence

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:54.519 align:middle line:84%
or absence of God,
in my opinion.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:57.322 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some places
science has real trouble going.

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:59.124 align:middle line:90%
And this is one them.

00:30:59.124 --> 00:31:01.693 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any God meters.

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:03.595 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, there's
no way to quantify God.

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:04.362 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Exactly.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.631 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a really
good God detector.

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Except for
what you're talking

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.235 align:middle line:84%
about-- the evidence
of premonitions.

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:14.005 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the closest
ways I've seen it described.

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:16.308 align:middle line:84%
Roberta from Facebook says
that she had a premonition

00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:18.877 align:middle line:84%
to go to a certain coffee shop,
where she would normally never

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:19.377 align:middle line:90%
go.

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:22.447 align:middle line:84%
She met a man there, gave him a
lead to the best work contract

00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:22.948 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:31:22.948 --> 00:31:24.683 align:middle line:84%
Is that considered
a premonition?

00:31:24.683 --> 00:31:26.084 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
I think that this

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:29.287 align:middle line:84%
is a possible example of what
we've just been talking about,

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:32.491 align:middle line:84%
how these things can operate
at an unconscious level.

00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:33.658 align:middle line:90%
She didn't have to go there.

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:34.226 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:36.528 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: She probably had
some good, solid reasons

00:31:36.528 --> 00:31:40.966 align:middle line:84%
not to go there, to
meet a stranger that

00:31:40.966 --> 00:31:44.302 align:middle line:90%
was completely unknown to her.

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:45.403 align:middle line:90%
But she did anyway.

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:47.405 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this
is one of the ways

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:51.276 align:middle line:84%
that premonitions occur
in a lot of people's lives

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:52.878 align:middle line:84%
at an unconscious,
subconscious level.

00:31:52.878 --> 00:31:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can
actually help other people

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.149 align:middle line:90%
if you follow the premonitions.

00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:59.751 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out how
do you recognize

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:02.854 align:middle line:84%
if it's an actual premonition--
and you say premonition.

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:04.456 align:middle line:90%
Explain why.

00:32:04.456 --> 00:32:07.159 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It probably has
to do with my southern way

00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:09.261 align:middle line:84%
of speaking that I've never
been able to eliminate.

00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:10.862 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:13.765 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
etymology, the origin,

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:16.535 align:middle line:84%
of the word premonition,
it comes from Greek words,

00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:21.206 align:middle line:84%
meaning a warning
that comes before.

00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:25.076 align:middle line:84%
And the before we
usually call a pre,

00:32:25.076 --> 00:32:28.046 align:middle line:84%
like a preamble
or a pre anything.

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So I just hang onto that long
E and call it a premonition.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I thought
that was intentional.

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:36.555 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because I've commonly
heard it premonition.

00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:39.858 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what are some of the
ways to determine what--

00:32:39.858 --> 00:32:42.661 align:middle line:90%
if it is actually a premonition?

00:32:42.661 --> 00:32:45.597 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there
are at least four clues,

00:32:45.597 --> 00:32:49.334 align:middle line:84%
I think, which can really help
us sort out the crazy nightmare

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:53.738 align:middle line:84%
foolish stuff from something we
really should pay attention to.

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:55.674 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
biggest clue of all

00:32:55.674 --> 00:32:57.676 align:middle line:90%
is the vividness of the dream.

00:32:57.676 --> 00:32:59.744 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to people
who have these knock

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:03.381 align:middle line:84%
your socks off premonitions,
they will almost always

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:07.252 align:middle line:84%
describe these as having
some special quality.

00:33:07.252 --> 00:33:10.255 align:middle line:84%
One woman told me
that they just seemed

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:13.024 align:middle line:90%
to be lit up from the inside.

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:16.962 align:middle line:84%
They just have a special
feel or glow to them.

00:33:16.962 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they're
really vivid, right?

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.965 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Extremely vivid.

00:33:19.965 --> 00:33:23.702 align:middle line:84%
That was my experience with
the dream I mentioned earlier.

00:33:23.702 --> 00:33:26.471 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I thought this
was the most vivid dream

00:33:26.471 --> 00:33:29.875 align:middle line:84%
in my life, which made no
sense in terms of the content.

00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:90%
But it was special.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:35.213 align:middle line:84%
Another woman told me
these things that turn out

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:38.683 align:middle line:84%
to be true, they come to her
in her dreams in italics.

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:39.885 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:41.486 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: As if there's some
special quality to them.

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:42.087 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Words?

00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:43.355 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:45.991 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: So people
struggle to find

00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:48.193 align:middle line:84%
ways to describe this
sense of specialness.

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:52.163 align:middle line:84%
But the vividness is, I
think, the best clue of all.

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:53.198 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK and then the--

00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:54.399 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: There are others, too.

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.034 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The other
one is that they're--

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:57.469 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: They're recurrent.

00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:00.305 align:middle line:84%
These things can come and
keep hammering at you, night

00:34:00.305 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:90%
after night after night.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.276 align:middle line:84%
And if that happens,
that is a huge clue

00:34:04.276 --> 00:34:06.077 align:middle line:90%
that you better listen up.

00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:07.579 align:middle line:90%
Another clue is that if they--

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:09.347 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how I
created my radio show,

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:84%
was the recurrent dream
of the Aware Show.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.452 align:middle line:84%
It was a title that
just kept coming

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:15.786 align:middle line:90%
in and coming in and coming in.

00:34:15.786 --> 00:34:17.188 align:middle line:84%
And I've done it
for 12 years now.

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:17.455 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Wow.

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:18.322 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So that's interesting.

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:19.024 align:middle line:90%
So that was a--

00:34:19.024 --> 00:34:19.824 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well your
viewers should be happy

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.626 align:middle line:84%
that you paid attention
to that premonitory dream.

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.495 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Very interesting,
very interesting.

00:34:23.495 --> 00:34:25.196 align:middle line:84%
I never really thought
about it that way.

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:26.231 align:middle line:90%
OK, another quality?

00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:28.065 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Another
criteria is whether or not

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:29.333 align:middle line:90%
they have to do with death.

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:30.835 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung, the
great psychologist,

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:84%
said that if you have
a dream about death,

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.672 align:middle line:84%
you better pay attention,
because you might not

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:36.107 align:middle line:90%
get a second chance.

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:38.275 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting-- death
of yourself, or others,

00:34:38.275 --> 00:34:39.811 align:middle line:90%
or in general?

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yes, in general.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.447 align:middle line:90%
Another is that they're shared.

00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:46.685 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have shared
dreams with their spouse,

00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:48.652 align:middle line:84%
with their lover,
with their friends.

00:34:48.652 --> 00:34:51.856 align:middle line:84%
And if people begin to have the
same dream about some upcoming

00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:55.327 align:middle line:84%
tragedy, for example the
9/11 World Trade Center

00:34:55.327 --> 00:34:57.429 align:middle line:84%
things, which I talk
about in the book,

00:34:57.429 --> 00:35:01.066 align:middle line:84%
shared dreams are a huge
clue that you better

00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:02.334 align:middle line:90%
wake up and pay attention.

00:35:02.334 --> 00:35:03.568 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And watch out.

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Catherine from
Facebook is saying,

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:07.505 align:middle line:84%
in my dreams I sometimes get
the feeling I'm getting messages

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:10.275 align:middle line:84%
from people who have died,
telling me that they're OK.

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:11.142 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:13.278 align:middle line:84%
Is that actually a
type of premonition?

00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:15.613 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I think
it's a type of what

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:18.083 align:middle line:84%
I want to call a non
local communication.

00:35:18.083 --> 00:35:22.854 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to be a
premonition in the sense

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.522 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
talking about them.

00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:26.925 align:middle line:84%
But I think that this is
a very valid phenomenon.

00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:90%
It occurs all the time.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.996 align:middle line:84%
And this might be an
opportunity for me

00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:34.366 align:middle line:84%
to slip in a plug
for my next book.

00:35:34.366 --> 00:35:38.036 align:middle line:84%
It's called The One Mind,
in which I make the proposal

00:35:38.036 --> 00:35:41.606 align:middle line:84%
that there is a Universal Mind
in which people communicate

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:43.274 align:middle line:84%
with people, not
only who are alive,

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:45.810 align:middle line:84%
but people who
are also deceased.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.478 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:47.312 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:50.582 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole-- that's
what the theme is through both

00:35:50.582 --> 00:35:53.918 align:middle line:84%
of your books, is the healing
words and the premonitions,

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.653 align:middle line:90%
is that this is all about--

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:57.122 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It's
about consciousness.

00:35:57.122 --> 00:35:57.622 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: About consciousness.

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:59.224 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It's
about how it isn't

00:35:59.224 --> 00:36:01.092 align:middle line:90%
confined to the here and now.

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:03.628 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that this
is a typical example

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:04.896 align:middle line:90%
of how that manifests.

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:06.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's about a
universal consciousness?

00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: A universal mind,
a universal consciousness,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:84%
what Carl Jung called the
collective unconscious--

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.239 align:middle line:84%
but the idea is that you
can't put consciousness

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:17.075 align:middle line:84%
in a box in a brain
and keep it there.

00:36:17.075 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:90%
It just won't stay in the brain.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.579 align:middle line:90%
It manifests in the distance--

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:22.247 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Outside.

00:36:22.247 --> 00:36:24.082 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --and
outside the present.

00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:25.917 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
actually the other thing,

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
is we didn't get to the fifth
symptom of the premonition.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.155 align:middle line:84%
Something to look
for is that they

00:36:30.155 --> 00:36:32.891 align:middle line:84%
had to do with something
in your bodily symptoms.

00:36:32.891 --> 00:36:35.026 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Oh, bodily
symptoms-- a lot of people

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.829 align:middle line:84%
who have valid premonitions,
even in dreams,

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:40.432 align:middle line:84%
have associated
physical symptoms

00:36:40.432 --> 00:36:44.569 align:middle line:84%
at the time they're having them,
which is a hugely helpful clue.

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.971 align:middle line:84%
These are not very
common, having a symptom

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:49.274 align:middle line:84%
associated with
your premonition.

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:51.142 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who's
a gynecologist who

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:54.913 align:middle line:84%
has premonitions about when his
patients are going to deliver.

00:36:54.913 --> 00:36:57.382 align:middle line:84%
This is always associated
with the feeling

00:36:57.382 --> 00:37:01.152 align:middle line:84%
of a strange sensation
in his chest.

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:04.189 align:middle line:84%
It's so reliable that the
nurses call him up and ask him

00:37:04.189 --> 00:37:07.058 align:middle line:84%
how his chest feels when
they're uncertain when

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:07.959 align:middle line:90%
a patient's going to--

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:08.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So he knows
the baby's going

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:10.862 align:middle line:84%
to come in when he has
this certain palpitation?

00:37:10.862 --> 00:37:13.131 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Exactly, he has
the feeling of a premonition

00:37:13.131 --> 00:37:15.867 align:middle line:84%
always associated with this very
strange feeling in his chest.

00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:16.801 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:18.369 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I know,
it's weird, isn't it?

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:19.237 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.905 align:middle line:90%
So what difference do they make?

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.340 align:middle line:84%
What difference
have premonitions

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.643 align:middle line:90%
made in our universe?

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:28.446 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well I think
one difference is it

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:29.814 align:middle line:84%
that they can help
us stay alive.

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:33.418 align:middle line:84%
I think that these things have
what evolutionary biologists

00:37:33.418 --> 00:37:35.453 align:middle line:90%
call survival value.

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:37.222 align:middle line:90%
This is not hard to get.

00:37:37.222 --> 00:37:41.259 align:middle line:84%
If you had an ability to see
what's coming down the track,

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:44.762 align:middle line:84%
even seconds or
minutes ahead of time,

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:47.031 align:middle line:84%
it would give you an
opportunity to avoid life

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:48.633 align:middle line:90%
threatening situations.

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:54.205 align:middle line:84%
So you'd stay alive, have a
greater chance to reproduce

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:55.406 align:middle line:90%
and perpetuate your genes.

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.775 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But can you practice it?

00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.244 align:middle line:90%
Can you get better at it?

00:37:59.244 --> 00:38:00.278 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:01.146 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:38:01.146 --> 00:38:01.946 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:04.182 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah, I
want to say that there

00:38:04.182 --> 00:38:07.719 align:middle line:84%
are people who are born with
huge talent in this area.

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:10.155 align:middle line:84%
There are premonition
prodigies, like there

00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:12.357 align:middle line:84%
are prodigies in athletics,
math, music, in anything.

00:38:12.357 --> 00:38:13.591 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We call them psychics.

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:14.692 align:middle line:90%
We call them-- right.

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Exactly.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.896 align:middle line:84%
So there are people who
are born with this gift--

00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:19.464 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Medical intuitives.

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:21.999 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --but if you want to
become more premonition prone

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:25.503 align:middle line:84%
and cultivate this, there are
two especially helpful things.

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:28.039 align:middle line:84%
One is just to
keep a dream diary

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:31.409 align:middle line:84%
where you write down
the dream on awakening,

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:33.378 align:middle line:84%
or talk it into a
tape recorder-- record

00:38:33.378 --> 00:38:34.779 align:middle line:90%
it in some way.

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:38.249 align:middle line:90%
This makes them more frequent.

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:41.719 align:middle line:84%
They are likely to happen
to you if you open up

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.688 align:middle line:90%
to them by doing this ritual.

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:46.691 align:middle line:84%
And also, perfecting a
discipline of meditation,

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
whether you call
it reverie, or just

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.797 align:middle line:84%
time out, or getting quieter, or
formal meditation-- people who

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:56.034 align:middle line:84%
do this have an ability
to let unconscious

00:38:56.034 --> 00:38:58.636 align:middle line:84%
processes come up
into awareness.

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:00.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, with that intention?

00:39:00.605 --> 00:39:02.273 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yes, with
that intention.

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So keeping a dream diary
and developing a disciplined

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.845 align:middle line:84%
practice of meditation
are the two best ways

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:10.114 align:middle line:84%
to becoming more
premonition prone.

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.583 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if all
of this is true,

00:39:11.583 --> 00:39:14.018 align:middle line:84%
and if the studies in
your book are all true,

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and all that we're
talking about is true,

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:22.126 align:middle line:84%
would it be fair to say that we
are definitely all connected?

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.329 align:middle line:84%
And so what you
do to other people

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:25.897 align:middle line:84%
will eventually
come back around.

00:39:25.897 --> 00:39:27.298 align:middle line:90%
Does that validate karma?

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:29.467 align:middle line:84%
There are so many places
you can go with this.

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.035 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
that's a beautiful way

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.538 align:middle line:84%
to express what I think
is one of the key lessons

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:90%
from premonitions.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.775 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's,
as you just brought

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.978 align:middle line:84%
up, an ethical
dimension to this.

00:39:39.978 --> 00:39:42.113 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with the
fact that we're connected.

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:48.152 align:middle line:84%
I've suggested that
the reality of this,

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.921 align:middle line:84%
showing that we're
all connected,

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:54.559 align:middle line:84%
allows us to revise the
golden rule and up the ante,

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:84%
as it were, by
saying that it's more

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:03.167 align:middle line:84%
about-- it's something that
goes beyond doing something

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:05.770 align:middle line:84%
to others because you want them
to do something nice for you,

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:09.240 align:middle line:84%
which is the usual way the
golden rule is phrased.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.111 align:middle line:84%
We can change that to this--
be nice to other people,

00:40:13.111 --> 00:40:16.481 align:middle line:84%
because in some
sense, they are you.

00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:19.984 align:middle line:84%
And this just kind of, I
think, intensifies this idea

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:21.819 align:middle line:90%
that we're all connected.

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:26.591 align:middle line:84%
And we'd better be careful about
how we behave to other people.

00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:28.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that
makes absolute sense.

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:30.228 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad that you said that.

00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:32.463 align:middle line:84%
Because there is an ethical
implication of what you're

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:35.266 align:middle line:84%
talking about here, that
regardless of science

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:38.269 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, it
validates that morality

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:41.706 align:middle line:84%
of staying-- of treating
your neighbors as you would,

00:40:41.706 --> 00:40:44.208 align:middle line:84%
of course, want to
be treated yourself.

00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:45.943 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I think
that that's right.

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:49.881 align:middle line:84%
And this also brings up
the idea of selfishness.

00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:52.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
develop premonitions

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:57.622 align:middle line:84%
to say, win the lottery
or make a killing on Wall

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:00.024 align:middle line:84%
Street and the
stock market, it's

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:01.159 align:middle line:90%
probably not going to work.

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:03.227 align:middle line:84%
Because the research
shows that if people

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:07.332 align:middle line:84%
try to cultivate premonitions
because of greed,

00:41:07.332 --> 00:41:09.233 align:middle line:84%
it just messes up
the whole thing.

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:10.768 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work.

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:14.205 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can premonitions
be used in an adverse affect?

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:17.141 align:middle line:84%
Can you use them in a harmful
way, if this is so powerful

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.944 align:middle line:90%
and if this is true?

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:24.515 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I think that
that is an aspect of this.

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:27.352 align:middle line:90%
And I touch on this in the book.

00:41:27.352 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But I'd rather keep
our conversation

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.823 align:middle line:84%
on an upbeat,
positive level here

00:41:31.823 --> 00:41:35.226 align:middle line:84%
and emphasize the way that
we can use premonitions

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.963 align:middle line:84%
in a benevolent, charitable,
and compassionate way

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:41.199 align:middle line:84%
to make the world a better
place, instead of a worse

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:41.733 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:43.568 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I absolutely
agree with that.

00:41:43.568 --> 00:41:46.037 align:middle line:84%
And we did talk a little
bit offline about the fact

00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:48.339 align:middle line:84%
that the premonitions
could be used in a way

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:53.578 align:middle line:84%
to reduce bacteria, to
shrink cancer cells--

00:41:53.578 --> 00:41:55.313 align:middle line:84%
things like that,
where they can actually

00:41:55.313 --> 00:41:58.216 align:middle line:84%
make a positive effect,
but used in an adverse way.

00:41:58.216 --> 00:42:00.752 align:middle line:84%
But it could still affect
people in a healing way.

00:42:00.752 --> 00:42:03.421 align:middle line:84%
But it always has to be done in
the name of healing, I believe.

00:42:03.421 --> 00:42:04.889 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Actually,
if premonitions

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:07.525 align:middle line:84%
are going to work
optimally, there

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:11.863 align:middle line:84%
has to be compassionate
intentions and a feeling

00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:17.235 align:middle line:84%
that we are connected in
almost always a loving way.

00:42:17.235 --> 00:42:20.505 align:middle line:84%
If you really want this
stuff to get off the ground

00:42:20.505 --> 00:42:24.375 align:middle line:84%
and pay dividends in
your life, then it

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.978 align:middle line:84%
has to be done out of love
and compassion and a sense

00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:31.282 align:middle line:84%
that I really care about you
and you really care about me,

00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:33.317 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
like this between us.

00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:35.653 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yep, that's what
this next slide suggests,

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:40.224 align:middle line:84%
is that we have this single,
unitary mind in some ways.

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:43.394 align:middle line:84%
So if you really are using
premonitions in the right way,

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:48.499 align:middle line:84%
it goes into that single
mind of the highest

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:51.169 align:middle line:90%
order, which is always love.

00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I
think that we're

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:57.375 align:middle line:84%
faced in our world with a
lot of challenges today,

00:42:57.375 --> 00:43:01.412 align:middle line:84%
from climate change
to overpopulation,

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:03.481 align:middle line:90%
to greed and acquisitiveness.

00:43:03.481 --> 00:43:05.716 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to get
out of this and scrape

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:08.686 align:middle line:84%
by as a species, I think we
better develop this sense

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:11.189 align:middle line:84%
that we're in it together,
and that we're connected.

00:43:11.189 --> 00:43:14.592 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, things
don't look really

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:17.228 align:middle line:84%
well for the future
of the human race.

00:43:17.228 --> 00:43:19.864 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a very good
overarching conversation

00:43:19.864 --> 00:43:21.399 align:middle line:90%
right there, absolutely.

00:43:21.399 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:84%
This is something that helps
the overall human race.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.605 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:29.841 align:middle line:84%
We have a comment
coming in from Facebook.

00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:33.978 align:middle line:84%
Barbara says that her
dad is an atheist.

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:36.514 align:middle line:84%
And are there studies
behind premonitions?

00:43:36.514 --> 00:43:38.416 align:middle line:84%
Are there scientific
studies behind this?

00:43:38.416 --> 00:43:40.117 align:middle line:84%
We've touched on a
little bit about this.

00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.652 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Well, absolutely.

00:43:41.652 --> 00:43:44.655 align:middle line:84%
The studies that
I've already alluded

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:47.024 align:middle line:84%
to that Dr. Radin and
many other investigators

00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:51.128 align:middle line:84%
have done with the
computer based studies

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:54.065 align:middle line:84%
showing that we can know
unconsciously what's

00:43:54.065 --> 00:43:58.469 align:middle line:84%
happening-- these
experiments work

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:01.272 align:middle line:84%
as well on agnostics
and atheists as they

00:44:01.272 --> 00:44:04.141 align:middle line:84%
do on believers in all
of this sort of thing.

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:07.945 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the key thing
is not whether or not

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:09.914 align:middle line:84%
you're agnostic or
atheistic or believers.

00:44:09.914 --> 00:44:10.982 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It doesn't matter.

00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:12.383 align:middle line:90%
It just works for everyone.

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:13.084 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:44:13.084 --> 00:44:15.186 align:middle line:84%
Another one from Facebook
is asking-- and thank you

00:44:15.186 --> 00:44:17.121 align:middle line:84%
for your comments coming
in-- how can women

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:20.625 align:middle line:84%
overcome societal instincts
to be nice to strangers when

00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:24.428 align:middle line:84%
our intuition is telling us
we're in dangerous situations?

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:27.999 align:middle line:84%
Instinct-- is there a difference
between instinct, intuition,

00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:28.900 align:middle line:90%
and premonition?

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.904 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well I think you can
fiddle with the definitions.

00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:34.705 align:middle line:84%
For my part, I think
it's impossible to put

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:36.774 align:middle line:84%
these things in a box
and separate them.

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:39.944 align:middle line:84%
I think instinct and
premonitions, precognition

00:44:39.944 --> 00:44:43.614 align:middle line:84%
and intuition, hunches,
vibes, gut feelings--

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:46.951 align:middle line:84%
I think all those things are
what I'm calling premonitions,

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:50.121 align:middle line:84%
or an intuition
about the future.

00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:51.989 align:middle line:84%
I would say we just
have to be open

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:54.692 align:middle line:90%
and trust our gut instincts.

00:44:54.692 --> 00:45:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I think when we deny the
validity of those things that

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.602 align:middle line:84%
just hammer on the door
and tell us, don't do that.

00:45:04.602 --> 00:45:05.303 align:middle line:90%
Don't go there.

00:45:05.303 --> 00:45:06.938 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:08.739 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: These deserve
to be listened to.

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:13.144 align:middle line:84%
And when we deny that, I think
it's an open door for disaster,

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:13.678 align:middle line:90%
occasionally.

00:45:13.678 --> 00:45:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
that most people listen

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.583 align:middle line:84%
to the premonitions
that are frightening,

00:45:18.583 --> 00:45:21.218 align:middle line:84%
rather than the-- have you
heard many people say, hey,

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:22.787 align:middle line:84%
I had this premonition
I got this job.

00:45:22.787 --> 00:45:26.324 align:middle line:84%
Or I had a premonition
that I had a baby.

00:45:26.324 --> 00:45:29.493 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well the idea that
premonitions operate just

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:32.597 align:middle line:84%
to warn us about horrible things
is not absolutely correct.

00:45:32.597 --> 00:45:34.932 align:middle line:84%
But people have intuitions
and premonitions

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:40.638 align:middle line:84%
about nice things--
pregnancy, a job promotion,

00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:43.007 align:middle line:84%
where you're going to
meet your soul mate.

00:45:43.007 --> 00:45:44.909 align:middle line:84%
I've got a stack of
these kinds of reports

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:48.946 align:middle line:84%
from people that deal with
positive, wonderful type

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:50.348 align:middle line:90%
premonitions.

00:45:50.348 --> 00:45:53.084 align:middle line:84%
I even have a friend
who says that she

00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:56.087 align:middle line:84%
has an unfailing
ability to know where

00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:59.624 align:middle line:84%
the last remaining
parking spot is.

00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:00.257 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.359 align:middle line:90%
That's practical.

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:04.061 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah, practical--
and she says, interestingly,

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:06.631 align:middle line:84%
that these premonitions
are mediated

00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:10.568 align:middle line:84%
by a goddess which
she calls Asphalta.

00:46:10.568 --> 00:46:12.203 align:middle line:90%
So Asphalta--

00:46:12.203 --> 00:46:13.904 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
what she's made up?

00:46:13.904 --> 00:46:15.306 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: She says
it never fails.

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:17.375 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't put
her to the test,

00:46:17.375 --> 00:46:19.477 align:middle line:84%
but this has caught
on in certain circles.

00:46:19.477 --> 00:46:23.147 align:middle line:84%
And on the internet you can
actually order little goddesses

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:26.384 align:middle line:84%
now with little angel wings
that are called Asphalta.

00:46:26.384 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You can hang them from
your rear view mirror,

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.757 align:middle line:84%
if you're into
goddesses and Asphalta.

00:46:32.757 --> 00:46:35.092 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's a
practical application for it.

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:38.362 align:middle line:84%
How many other ways can we
use the idea of premonitions

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:40.965 align:middle line:84%
in a practical way--
maybe in business.

00:46:40.965 --> 00:46:43.701 align:middle line:90%
Can we foreshadow things?

00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, there have
been a lot of studies looking

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.106 align:middle line:84%
at the connection between
premonitions and success

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:50.775 align:middle line:90%
in business.

00:46:50.775 --> 00:46:55.713 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, a lot of
Fortune 500 corporation CEOs

00:46:55.713 --> 00:46:56.914 align:middle line:90%
have been tested.

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, the ones who
score highest on premonition

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.987 align:middle line:84%
abilities are the ones
who are most successful

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:05.289 align:middle line:84%
in the bottom lines
of their corporations.

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:08.826 align:middle line:84%
So there's a strong correlation
between premonition ability

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:10.628 align:middle line:90%
and success in business.

00:47:10.628 --> 00:47:13.197 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do they score
high in premonition abilities?

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.665 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: There
are tests where you

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:18.502 align:middle line:84%
can have people predict
what number's coming up

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.304 align:middle line:90%
in a string of 10 digits.

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:21.672 align:middle line:84%
These are very
complicated tests.

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.974 align:middle line:84%
But it really does
test people's ability

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:26.544 align:middle line:84%
to see what's coming
down the pike.

00:47:26.544 --> 00:47:27.478 align:middle line:90%
But there's a warning.

00:47:27.478 --> 00:47:29.747 align:middle line:84%
And I've already touched
on it a little bit.

00:47:29.747 --> 00:47:33.117 align:middle line:84%
If people really
want to go after this

00:47:33.117 --> 00:47:38.756 align:middle line:84%
and say oh, I'm going to use my
premonitions to break the bank

00:47:38.756 --> 00:47:43.127 align:middle line:84%
or win the big lottery, it
usually just goes south.

00:47:43.127 --> 00:47:49.233 align:middle line:84%
If greed enters into your desire
to become good at premonitions,

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:52.236 align:middle line:84%
you can predict that that's
not going to work very well.

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:54.572 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this wasn't a
premonition of you, of yours,

00:47:54.572 --> 00:47:55.673 align:middle line:90%
to write this book, right?

00:47:55.673 --> 00:47:57.975 align:middle line:84%
You kind of backed
into this whole thing.

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:59.677 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah, I
didn't want to do this.

00:47:59.677 --> 00:48:00.878 align:middle line:90%
But I--

00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How has it
been received when

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.815 align:middle line:84%
you go to medical
communities and you

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:06.217 align:middle line:90%
lecture about premonitions?

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.752 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I
had the opportunity

00:48:07.752 --> 00:48:10.755 align:middle line:84%
to put that to the test
a couple years ago,

00:48:10.755 --> 00:48:16.627 align:middle line:84%
talking to a large group of
Harvard-affiliated doctors

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:20.231 align:middle line:84%
who were gathered for a
continuing medical education

00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.398 align:middle line:90%
course in internal medicine.

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:23.434 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to talk
about something different,

00:48:23.434 --> 00:48:25.703 align:middle line:84%
so I thought I'd talk about
premonitions, expecting

00:48:25.703 --> 00:48:27.605 align:middle line:84%
that they would all
get up and walk out.

00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:28.773 align:middle line:90%
Nobody left.

00:48:28.773 --> 00:48:31.175 align:middle line:84%
And in the Q&A
session, for example,

00:48:31.175 --> 00:48:33.611 align:middle line:84%
they began to tell me
their premonitions.

00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:36.714 align:middle line:84%
One female intern stood
up and she said, well

00:48:36.714 --> 00:48:38.282 align:middle line:90%
I get premonitions.

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:40.918 align:middle line:90%
I get numbers in my dreams.

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:45.022 align:middle line:84%
She said, I dream the specific
values of my patients' lab

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:48.092 align:middle line:84%
tests before I even
order the tests.

00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:49.393 align:middle line:90%
And it went from there.

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:50.194 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:48:50.194 --> 00:48:50.795 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:48:50.795 --> 00:48:51.996 align:middle line:90%
And more people--

00:48:51.996 --> 00:48:54.165 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah, people
just came forward,

00:48:54.165 --> 00:48:56.700 align:middle line:84%
as if I gave them premonitions,
for the first time

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.103 align:middle line:84%
in their life, to go
public with this stuff.

00:48:59.103 --> 00:48:59.904 align:middle line:90%
And many of them--

00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:00.137 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gave them permission.

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: --would introduce
their comments by saying,

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.874 align:middle line:90%
you may think I'm crazy.

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.343 align:middle line:84%
And you're the first person
I've ever told this in my life,

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:10.114 align:middle line:84%
but-- and then they would
come forth with these things.

00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and so once
you give permission and open

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.586 align:middle line:84%
the room to a scientific
community-- but the fact

00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:18.155 align:middle line:84%
that you've validated it
all scientifically makes

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.490 align:middle line:90%
such a huge difference.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.692 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: It makes a tremendous
amount of difference.

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:24.762 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For you, specifically,
and for the medical community.

00:49:24.762 --> 00:49:27.398 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: And the fact, in
that particular situation,

00:49:27.398 --> 00:49:31.368 align:middle line:84%
that I was willing to tell them
my premonitions, which I did,

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:34.104 align:middle line:84%
and be willing to make
a fool out of myself,

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:36.974 align:middle line:84%
gave them permission
to come forward

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:39.443 align:middle line:84%
and say things to this
group that they had never

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:41.178 align:middle line:90%
told another living soul.

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:42.713 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, do
you still practice,

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:44.248 align:middle line:90%
and do people still come to you?

00:49:44.248 --> 00:49:45.349 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: I don't practice.

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:47.084 align:middle line:84%
I've retired from
clinical practice.

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:48.586 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Clinical
practice as an internist?

00:49:48.586 --> 00:49:50.187 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: As an
internist, that's right.

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:51.589 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But do
people come to you?

00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:53.123 align:middle line:84%
Are you a bit of
a different doctor

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:56.694 align:middle line:84%
now-- are you a
premonition doctor?

00:49:56.694 --> 00:50:00.931 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well, I get
requests from people

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:04.835 align:middle line:84%
to be remembered in healing
intentions and prayers.

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:08.272 align:middle line:84%
And I have a long list that
I go through every day.

00:50:08.272 --> 00:50:10.274 align:middle line:90%
And I do that.

00:50:10.274 --> 00:50:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in contact with people
who have real problems,

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.379 align:middle line:84%
but I don't offer
medical advice.

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:18.382 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you have a
ritual, or a daily ceremony

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:19.717 align:middle line:90%
for yourself, for--

00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:20.351 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: I do.

00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:20.784 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:20.918 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:50:20.918 --> 00:50:21.785 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Yeah, I do.

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:23.153 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:25.189 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we just have a
short amount of time.

00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Just tell us--

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.824 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: Well,
that's very private.

00:50:26.824 --> 00:50:27.224 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it is?

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:28.325 align:middle line:84%
>>DOSSEY: I think I'll
hang onto that one.

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:29.793 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, all right.

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:31.662 align:middle line:84%
All right, well,
thank you so much.

00:50:31.662 --> 00:50:34.164 align:middle line:84%
Again, the book is "The
Power of Premonitions,"

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:37.768 align:middle line:84%
and his wonderful book, 20 year
anniversary, Healing Words.

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:39.003 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Dr. Dossey.

00:50:39.003 --> 00:50:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Thanks, Lisa.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.472 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --for everything
you've contributed

00:50:41.472 --> 00:50:43.474 align:middle line:90%
to this incredible community.

00:50:43.474 --> 00:50:44.308 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, so much.

00:50:44.308 --> 00:50:45.175 align:middle line:90%
>>DOSSEY: Absolutely.

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right, oh wow.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:50.314 align:middle line:84%
