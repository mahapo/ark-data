00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello and welcome.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Recently there have been some
very incredible discoveries

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
in science and very
compelling evidence

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:90%
found in our Earth's history.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us reasons
to think differently

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.890 align:middle line:84%
about ourselves and about
the origin of our species.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today
is Gregg Braden .

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:84%
He's a "New York Times"
bestselling author.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And he's internationally
recognized

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
as a pioneer that bridges
science and spirituality.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Gregg is a computer geologist.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the first
technical operations

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:90%
manager at Cisco Systems.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And today he's joining
us to help us understand

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
this critical time that we
are in in history right now.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of a book
called "Deep Truth," among many.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
"Deep Truth" is about
igniting the memory

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.234 align:middle line:84%
of our origin, history,
destiny, and fate.

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Lisa, I
am so happy to be here

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:90%
with you today.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Welcome.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Thank you.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
It's taken us so a time
to get to this stage.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And we
have so much that I'd

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:84%
like to share with our
listeners today and with you.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So much.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: New material
for you as well.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.894 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very, very
eager to learn.

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Very eager to get into this
topic with our listeners

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:90%
so that they can learn as well.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.377 align:middle line:84%
What-- the title of
the book, "Deep Truth."

00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:21.085 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is one
of the first things

00:01:21.085 --> 00:01:21.876 align:middle line:90%
that people ask me.

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Where does the title
"Deep Truth" come from?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's a
very presumptuous title.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
comes from a quote

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
from one of the
outstanding physicists

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.480 align:middle line:84%
of the early and mid-20th
century, Niels Bohr,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.484 align:middle line:84%
in a conversation that he was
having with Albert Einstein.

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
The two of them were talking,
just like we are here.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I often wonder
if even they knew

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
how profound the statements
that they were making

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
were in the moment that
they were sharing them.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we get
to have those, too.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, in this case,
they were talking about truth,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:90%
the nature of scientific truths.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And the direct quote, what
Niels Bohr actually said,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
was that "It is the
hallmark of any deep truth

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that its negation is
also a deep truth."

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So within a
deep truth, the hallmark

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that there's
also another deep truth?

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, in science.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:84%
This is all
pertaining to science.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Our scientific
view of the world,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
the universe, our bodies,
is based upon principles

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:90%
that we hold to be true.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have been
around for almost 300 years.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
When new discoveries overturn
existing deep truths,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
then the new discoveries
become the new deep truths.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So when the new discoveries
negate the existing truths,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:90%
they become the new deep truths.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's perfect.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: OK.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:90%
This is the good news.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason
that I'm sharing--

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
so passionate about sharing
this material today,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
because the fact of deep
truths being overturned

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.949 align:middle line:84%
by new discoveries is precisely
where we find ourselves

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what we're going

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to be doing today,
is really getting

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
through some cutting-edge
material here

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:84%
that are actually going to
shatter a lot of belief systems

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.102 align:middle line:84%
that we learned in
school, that is currently

00:02:59.102 --> 00:03:00.060 align:middle line:90%
being taught in school.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
This is cutting-edge
information.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to open
and expand your mind

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
during this conversation
because it's so worth it.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, they are, Lisa.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.508 align:middle line:84%
And for you and for our
viewers, what I've done

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
is I've put together
just a few images

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to punctuate and highlight the
conversation that you and I are

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%
having here.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to begin by saying
that the good news is

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
that new discoveries are
changing the way we've been led

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
to think of ourselves, our
relationship to the earth,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to one
another, where we come from,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
how long we've been here,
how we solve our problems.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:84%
The flipside is that there
is a reluctance-- and in,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
some cases, a
resistance-- to share

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.715 align:middle line:84%
this information in mainstream
circles, in mainstream media,

00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in mainstream documentaries,
in mainstream classrooms,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:90%
and the mainstream textbooks.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
emphasize that it's not

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.605 align:middle line:84%
the teachers that
are so reluctant.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:50.595 align:middle line:84%
But there's a system
that we're working with.

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to say it's
good, bad, right, or wrong.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a system that
served us very well

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and gotten us to the
point we are now.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:84%
However, because we are
facing such great crises

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
in a little window
of time, we are

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
being asked to think
differently than we ever

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.583 align:middle line:90%
have before to solve the crises.

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about those crises today.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:84%
If we attempt to
solve the crises

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
through the same thinking
that has led to the crises,

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
we know where that's
going to carry us.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's imperative that we
open our hearts and minds

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:90%
to the new discovery.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Science-based discoveries.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't wishful thinking.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:90%
They aren't hypotheses.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
These are proven, scientific,
peer-reviewed discoveries

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.497 align:middle line:90%
published in the tech journals.

00:04:32.497 --> 00:04:34.580 align:middle line:84%
They're simply not being
shared in the mainstream.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'd
like to do today

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and what the book, "Deep
Truth," is all about.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's exactly.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.461 align:middle line:84%
You always know
you're onto something

00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:84%
good when you're breaking
through that window

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:90%
there, which is great.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.137 align:middle line:84%
So yes, the
PowerPoint really does

00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
help illustrate this
conversation because we don't

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
have images of this from our
background, our schooling,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Gregg has traveled to the
far ends of the Earth.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to see very, very

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
special, exclusive
snapshots today of places

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:84%
that he's been that he's
sharing with us exclusively here

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
today that are owned
by the Smithsonian.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Many of them are.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.857 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Some of them are.

00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And also by Gregg.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.517 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very, very grateful
for you bringing it

00:05:11.517 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:90%
to us on this level.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's dive in.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, I'd
like to just begin

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
by saying it's not
our imagination.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're watching
this program today,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:84%
we're having this conversation,
it's no news to anyone

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that this is no ordinary time
in the history of our world.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It's no ordinary time in the
history of our civilization.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Or regardless of what
nation you live in,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
you know it's no ordinary time
in the history of your country.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.524 align:middle line:84%
Something very, very
different is happening now.

00:05:35.524 --> 00:05:36.565 align:middle line:90%
It's not our imagination.

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
The best minds of our
time are telling us

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
in very, very clear terms
that this generation right now

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
in these years, we are living
the greatest number of crises

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
ever to face a single
generation in humankind.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And each crisis in and of
itself, if left unchecked,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
has the potential to
forever end the way of life

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.532 align:middle line:90%
as we know it today.

00:05:57.532 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
generation meaning

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.666 align:middle line:90%
40 to 50 years or longer?

00:06:00.666 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This
generation meaning

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.042 align:middle line:84%
the-- from the mid-20th century
into the early 21st century

00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.540 align:middle line:84%
The image that you're seeing
on your screen right now

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
is a special edition of the
journal "Scientific American."

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
It was released in
September of 2005--

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.716 align:middle line:84%
so think all the
way back to 2005.

00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:90%
It was a very different world.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Many of the things
we're dealing with now,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:84%
like the economic crisis,
hadn't quite happened yet.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
But it was during this time some
of the best minds of our time--

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:84%
scientists, engineers,
philosophers,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
social architects, political
leaders, spiritual leaders,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:90%
religious leaders.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.305 align:middle line:84%
They all came together and they
were asked a single question.

00:06:35.305 --> 00:06:36.814 align:middle line:90%
And the question was, what's up?

00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's so different
about our time right now?

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Their answers were so profound
that the journal "Scientific

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.706 align:middle line:84%
American" released a special
edition, September, 2005,

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:84%
to bring the rest
of the world up

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to speed with what it
is that had happened

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:90%
among those great minds.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And the title, Lisa,
tells the whole story.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
"Crossroads for
Planet Earth." this

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:84%
is the scientific
community acknowledging

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:90%
that we're in trouble.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is when all the
global warming conversations

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%
were igniting and so forth, yes.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.775 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:07:03.775 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:90%
They addressed global warming.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Certainly the potential
of an economic collapse.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.714 align:middle line:90%
Again, this was 2005.

00:07:08.714 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, before
the housing crisis.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Diminishing resources.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Diminishing fresh water.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
The lack of food in so
many parts of the world.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Population competing for so
many different resources.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.086 align:middle line:84%
So this was their attempt
to let the rest of the world

00:07:25.086 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:90%
know that something was up.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've come to
appreciate the term crisis

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
because, for me, crisis now
means that it's not over yet.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.799 align:middle line:90%
We have time to do something.

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
If we were not still in a
crisis, it would be too late.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great reframe.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So they were
identifying many of the crises

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.782 align:middle line:90%
that we're facing now.

00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.240 align:middle line:84%
The things that
we've talked about.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.281 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
them a little bit more.

00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But what it is
that's happening now,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
what it is that makes our
time so very, very different,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:84%
is that we are experiencing
natural cycles of the Earth,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
including climate change--that
we're going to talk about--

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:84%
that are pushing
unsustainable ways of thinking

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and unsustainable ways of
living to the very limits.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.464 align:middle line:84%
And if we look carefully,
Lisa, while for many people,

00:08:07.464 --> 00:08:09.380 align:middle line:84%
it looks like the world
is simply coming apart

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
at the seams-- if we
look really carefully,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.820 align:middle line:84%
the only things coming
apart are the ways of life

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that are no longer sustainable
in the presence of a changing

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.996 align:middle line:84%
They have served us to the point
they got us where we are today.

00:08:20.996 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not judging our past
as right, wrong, good or bad.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:90%
We're in a huge learning curve.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's brought
a lot of awareness about--

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.926 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It has brought a
tremendous amount of awareness.

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:90%
So the changes.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where the
science and our most cherished

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
indigenous and
spiritual traditions

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:90%
really come together.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the science is telling
us about cycles of time

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:90%
that are bringing the changes.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.375 align:middle line:84%
But they've only recently
begun to understand those.

00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Our indigenous ancestors
have been telling us

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.550 align:middle line:84%
for 5,000 years,
look out, generation

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of the early 20th century,
right around the year 2012.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not the end of the world.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the end of a cycle of
time called a Great World Age.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.719 align:middle line:84%
And with that, you can expect
some big changes in your life.

00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
I'd like to talk about.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.266 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely

00:09:03.266 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Right
now, the changes.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
People are asking,
what's different?

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
What causes the changes?

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They're triggered by
Earth's location in space.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Earth is a very dynamic system.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
We all know that it spins
to create night and day

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:90%
and tilts for the seasons.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:90%
It does much more than that.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
In space, it's the orbit,
the tilt, the angle,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
the wobble of Earth
in space, and how

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
it changes our relationship
to the sun, the energy

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:84%
that we receive from the sun,
from the center of our Milky

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Way galaxy.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, our own science
through the ice cores

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica and the poles
have begun to confirm this.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.249 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about this in more detail.

00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Our own science now
is confirming it.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But our indigenous
ancestors knew this.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.136 align:middle line:84%
Somehow they knew this
without ice cores, and GPS,

00:09:46.136 --> 00:09:47.385 align:middle line:90%
and computers, and satellites.

00:09:47.385 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, they've been
around for over 100 years.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.018 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
thousands of years.

00:09:52.018 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And they knew because they
understood the cycles.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the things
that Western traditions

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:90%
are only beginning to grasp.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
We have been led to think of
ourselves in a linear fashion.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
That civilization
happened the one time

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:84%
from primitive to advanced,
where we are today.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:90%
In very linear terms.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the world, in
the ancient traditions,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
have traditionally thought of
our lives and our relationship

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.253 align:middle line:90%
to the world in terms of cycles.

00:10:17.253 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So the cycle that
we're living now.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
They say, of course
the world's going

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
to change because
it always does.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
When you reach the point
where you are in this cycle,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.619 align:middle line:84%
you will undergo the
end of a way of life.

00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Not the end of the world.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:84%
The end of a way of life
that's no longer sustainable.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's no
longer working, yes.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's like a
great reality check.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.401 align:middle line:90%
A cosmic reality check.

00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
We get to see what
works and what doesn't.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.608 align:middle line:84%
The things that
don't work anymore?

00:10:40.608 --> 00:10:41.634 align:middle line:90%
Let's stop doing them.

00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's stop doing them.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:90%
And the things that work well?

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.558 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a lot of them.

00:10:44.558 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's discover what
those things are.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So our ancestors, somehow,
they understood these cycles.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And they described them
in many different ways.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.664 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ancestors lived
very close to the earth.

00:10:55.664 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And they talked
about earth signs,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
like the birth of
a white buffalo

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:90%
on the plains of North America.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.395 align:middle line:84%
Or when the crops no longer
grew in their seasons.

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They knew to
look out for those, yes.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:05.894 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:11:05.894 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But to a scientist, that
means nothing to a scientist

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
because it's not based
on anything factual.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not reproducible.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.286 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: The Maya, however.

00:11:13.286 --> 00:11:15.791 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Maya thought much
the way that we do today.

00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:90%
They dealt with numbers.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And their numbers
were based on cycles

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that were driven by rare
astronomical alignments

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
that we can confirm with
our computers today.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're drawn to the
Mayan way of thinking

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:90%
and the Mayan calendar.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:84%
However, I just want to share
with our listeners, the image

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing on your
screen right now,

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
many people use this to
represent the Mayan calendar.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:84%
There is no single artifact that
represents the Mayan calendar

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and the many systems of
timekeeping that the Maya had.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing
on your screen

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:84%
is the Aztec calendar
that actually

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
is derived from elements
of the Mayan calendar.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's no one
set template, calendar?

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: There were so many--

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.009 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Different.

00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --different cycles
that the Maya incorporated

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
into their
understandings of time.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It was more than just
boom, boom, boom.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those are
some of the images

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.430 align:middle line:90%
we're going to see later.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: They are.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
image that we're seeing now,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
what I'd like to call
to your attention--

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.348 align:middle line:84%
you should be able to
see this on your screen--

00:12:11.348 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:84%
are the four boxes that
I've highlighted in red.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
From the Mayan perspective,
and in many of the Mesoamerican

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
traditions as well,
those four boxes

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.597 align:middle line:84%
represent the four cycles
prior to this cycle.

00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So they say we've been
through these changes

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:90%
at least four times in the past.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the value of
going into the past.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
If we can understand what
our ancestors lived through,

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and understand what
they did to deal

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.109 align:middle line:84%
with the crises
in their time, it

00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:38.400 align:middle line:90%
may be able to help us in ours.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:84%
We could learn from
their mistakes.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, there's this
beautiful, beautiful continuity

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:90%
of human experience.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:90%
From ancient?

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:90%
But obsolete?

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
To the very present.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.419 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So these cycles.

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So these are
four previous cycles

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.543 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at right now.

00:12:53.543 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The glyphs within each box
represent how the cycles ended.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:84%
One ended with a great wind
that covered the earth.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
One was the great fire
that covered the earth.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:84%
One was when ice
covered the earth.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
One was when the ice melted,
water cover the earth.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:90%
The great flood.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they're
all natural disasters.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.165 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Think about this.

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Earth, air-- I mean, Earth, air.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.719 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wind, fire.

00:13:13.719 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Fire and water.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
the four elements.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Where are we right now?

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the big question.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Our cycle is staring us right
in the face on this screen.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
It is the image of
the fifth glyph,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.839 align:middle line:90%
which simply means movement.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
They can't tell us what
the movement means.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:84%
It could be a physical
movement of the Earth.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
movement of thinking.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:90%
A movement of belief.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
A movement of consciousness,
which I tend to believe

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:90%
is what's happening.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.666 align:middle line:84%
A change in the way of
movement, in the way

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:84%
we think about our
relationship to the world.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This symbol
symbolizes movement?

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Movement, yeah.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It symbolizes--

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Aren't you glad
we're having this conversation?

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.265 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:43.265 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It's great.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, wait.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.820 align:middle line:90%
I see man.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I see a face.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is the symbol,
the glyph, for movement.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But isn't it
interesting that it is a face.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It is.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.178 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And right
now because we're

00:13:51.178 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
exceeding our resources
with the population.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Precisely
what this is.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So what the Mayan tradition
tells us is our cycle,

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
it's not some nebulous time
of beginning and ending.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:90%
It's very precise.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Our cycle began with the
rare astronomical alignment

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:90%
on August 11, 3114 BC.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:90%
So this is the biblical era.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting because
so many spiritual traditions

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
originated to deal--
help people deal

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
with the changes of
the cycle that they

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:90%
were going through then.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to what
we're going through now.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So our cycle began
August 11, 3114 BC.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It ends precisely, Lisa,
1,872,000 days later.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:90%
That's a 5,125-year cycle.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:36.704 align:middle line:90%
1,872,000 days later it ends.

00:14:36.704 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And that happens to be
precisely on the winter

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
solstice, December
21 of the year 2012.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 2012.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So they knew that
that solstice and that alignment

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:84%
1,872,000 days later would bring
us to the close of this cycle.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
That we would experience the
tilt, the angle, and the wobble

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
driving so many of the
changes, including climate,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
how we grow our food, how we
share our resources, how we

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
deal with a population
of 7 billion.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Coming to terms
with these changes.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:90%
They knew that.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Somehow they knew that.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just want to mention
that why that this is relevant

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is all of the information
you've heard about 2012,

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and all of the fantasy, like
movies that are being done

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
about the end of time and so
forth, even the magazine covers

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:90%
that you've shown me.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
This is about
debunking those myths.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:90%
This is about the facts.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
This is about the
science behind that.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Those are stories for right now.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what the facts are.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.148 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, I'll say it
to our viewers right now.

00:15:34.148 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen those
images and the very

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.150 align:middle line:84%
authoritative documentaries
that Lisa's referencing,

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and some of the Hollywood films
that were for entertainment,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
there is no scientific
evidence that anything bad

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
will happen on specifically
this date in our future.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it's about
a zone of time.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're already living
the changes of that zone.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:84%
We're living the
climate warming.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.520 align:middle line:84%
We're living the--
the ice is melting.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:90%
The sea levels are rising.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Multiple forest fires on
multiple continents raging out

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.480 align:middle line:90%
of controls.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.892 align:middle line:90%
Disease with no medical cure.

00:16:03.892 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of millions
of people are dying.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Many war fronts.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And we also know there are a lot
of really good things happening

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:90%
in this planet right now.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a new world
that is emerging

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of the
chaos of the world that

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:90%
is no longer sustainable.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so
important just to say this.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Not one of the
indigenous traditions,

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:84%
at least that I'm aware of,
has ever said specifically

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:90%
that our world will end.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:84%
They've all said
we have a choice.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And the dark ending that's
the focus of the media

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:90%
is one possibility.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
There's another possibility
because we could just as easily

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
say this is the beginning of
a new cycle, the beginning

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:90%
of a new world age.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But people like
to talk about ends

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.570 align:middle line:90%
more than they do beginnings.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.236 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And because the
beginning has to do

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.435 align:middle line:90%
with us unfolding our hearts.

00:16:46.435 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I think so.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
That's precisely where
we're going with this.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's not
as sexy in the media

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:90%
to be talking about that, yes.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.979 align:middle line:84%
It is an inner journey
where we're going.

00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think
you're right, Lisa.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.019 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd
like to do, I'd like

00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:84%
to share with you, with
our viewers-- the science.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And science doesn't mean
it has to be technical.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Science just means
these are proven facts.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.272 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to share them
in a very non-technical way.

00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I think our listeners
probably know

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
history of our planet

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that's locked in the
ice cores or in the ice

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:90%
caps of the Earth.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Every year, a new layer
of ice is deposited.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:84%
It captures air bubbles
of the atmosphere--

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%
dust, pollen grains.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And when it freezes over, it
creates a permanent layer.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:84%
There is what we could think of
as a virtual library of Earth's

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.030 align:middle line:90%
history locked up in the poles.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.679 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, the
scientists of the Earth

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
got together from many
different countries,

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
many different
scientific disciplines.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And they agreed to preserve as
much of this data as they could

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.479 align:middle line:84%
by drilling through the
deepest and the thickest part

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:90%
of the ice in Antarctica.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
But even the
scientists were amazed

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:90%
at how much data was revealed.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Each year is represented
by one layer of ice.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
They drilled through over
420,000 layers of ice.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:84%
420,000 years of the
history of this planet.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:84%
We now have to
compare with where

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
we are right now to
see if we are truly

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:90%
living in an anomalous time.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I'd like
to share with our viewers.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
If you've never
seen an ice core,

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.388 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see what
the ice cores look like.

00:18:11.388 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
You should be seeing them
on your screen right now.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:90%
This is part of an ice library.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And from these
ancient cores, we can

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:84%
discover ancient temperatures,
ancient sea levels,

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:84%
how strong the energy
from the sun was,

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:84%
how strong the magnetic field
of the Earth was, so much more.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So the first graph of data
derived from the ice cores.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.349 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
it on your screen.

00:18:32.349 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And it might look
a little technical.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But all I'd like for
you to see from this

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
is that, obviously,
cycles are present.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.950 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
looking at here.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The up, down, up, down.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The present is on the
left-hand side of the screen.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
450,000 years into the
past toward the right.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The upper two graphs are
two different ice cores

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that actually track
one another in terms

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.891 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient temperatures.

00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you're
just a layman, you

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:84%
could see there's
a pattern here.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:90%
There's a pattern.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Every 100,000 years
roughly, there's a warming,

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and then followed
immediately by a cooling.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.647 align:middle line:84%
The graph on the bottom is
showing the ice thickness.

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:90%
It's very intuitive.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
The ice thickness collapses when
the temperatures get warmer.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So when Earth heats
up, the ice melts.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And when the temperatures
cool, then the ice

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.392 align:middle line:90%
becomes thicker again.

00:19:19.392 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It makes sense.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
seeing from this graph.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Where we are is on the far left.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And it is obvious that we
are in an upward surge, where

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:84%
we would expect the
climate to be warming.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So Lisa, as a geologist,
what I can say to you

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
is if Earth were
not experiencing

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of warming
now, I'd be concerned

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.490 align:middle line:84%
because I'd say
what's different now

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.764 align:middle line:84%
than there has been for
the last 450,000 years?

00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Based on the cycles.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.513 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, based
on these cycles.

00:19:43.513 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:90%
What is it that's different now?

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
This is probably the
most complex graph.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's one example
that I'd just

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.140 align:middle line:90%
like to share with our viewers.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to highlight in red.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:90%
This is from the ice cores.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing in red,
this is the intensity

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.606 align:middle line:90%
of the sun reaching the earth.

00:20:00.606 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was a kid, I used to
think it was always the same.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.144 align:middle line:90%
Summertime, it's hot.

00:20:04.144 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Wintertime, it's cold.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.535 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Missouri, in
the Midwestern gray skies

00:20:07.535 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:90%
of Missouri.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist, what
I learned was nothing

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:90%
could be further from the truth.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:84%
That there is a
tremendous variation.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So we see the first
arrow I'm bringing up.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:90%
This is present time.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:90%
This is today.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that we
are experiencing actually

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:90%
a little spike in the energy.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:90%
There's a little intense spike.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
A greater intensity of
energy from the sun today.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Now the next arrow.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:90%
This is 5,000 years ago.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:90%
This is one world age ago.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.705 align:middle line:84%
1,872,000 days ago, there
was another little spike.

00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
lot of other stuff

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.564 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even talking about here.

00:20:45.564 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like to call
your attention to is this.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
spike today, and you

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:53.537 align:middle line:84%
look at where it was 5,000 years
ago, they're almost identical.

00:20:53.537 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to clean this up
so we can see it even better.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:56.954 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:20:56.954 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Look at the top
of the green line.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.435 align:middle line:84%
We are experiencing almost the
same intense energy of the sun

00:21:01.435 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
today as we were then.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Now let's extend it back another
5,000 years, another world age

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
cycle, and we see that
10,000 years ago, it's

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:90%
almost the same as well.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.485 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So why all the crisis?

00:21:12.485 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Why all the--

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
because if we are not

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
accustomed to thinking
in terms of cycles.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:23.540 align:middle line:84%
When a scientist looks at 20
years, or 50 years, or 100,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.414 align:middle line:84%
or 500 years, and sees
temperatures warming,

00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:27.080 align:middle line:90%
they're alarmed.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.204 align:middle line:90%
They say something's wrong.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:90%
It's all about context, Lisa.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
everything that we have done

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:90%
is wrong.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.509 align:middle line:84%
And I'm certain that
the carbon dioxide

00:21:37.509 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
we're throwing in the
atmosphere is contributing.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:90%
It definitely is contributing.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Is it the cause?

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:90%
No, it cannot be.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Because we see these
cycles of warming

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
450,000 years in the past,
before we had the industry--

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.927 align:middle line:90%
we believe.

00:21:50.927 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we had
the industry then

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have now, or the number
of people and the populations.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's usually
the contributing factor

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:90%
in everything I hear.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, it is.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing
now-- and this

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.560 align:middle line:84%
is one example of
the kind of data

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:90%
that comes from the ice cores.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just using
this as one example.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:84%
What I've done is
I pulled together,

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
in the interest of time, many
different parameters from

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:84%
the last two world age cycles,
from the last two 5,000-year

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
cycles, averaging those together
so that we can really get

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
a handle-- are we
living a broken Earth?

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Are we living something
anomalous today?

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.196 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to tell
the answer right here.

00:22:26.196 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:90%
The categories on the left.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic strength
of the Earth.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Global warming,
the temperatures.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
What's happening with the polar
ice, is it melting or growing.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And the intensity
of the sun's energy.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Historically,

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:84%
in the last two cycles
that we're talking about

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.589 align:middle line:84%
that the Mayans
identified, historically

00:22:43.589 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic fields
of the Earth have

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:84%
been measured in
units called VADM.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Very technical.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have to
worry about what it means.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But they were
measured in numbers

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
that range from 5.5
to 10.5 on this scale.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.624 align:middle line:84%
Presently, we are
at 7.5, right--

00:22:57.624 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right in the middle.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --where I
would expect us to be.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:90%
It is not anomalous.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:84%
We are right where we should be
for where we are in the cycle

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Global warming.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.407 align:middle line:84%
Historically, the planet
rises 1 to 2 degrees Celsius,

00:23:09.407 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
depending on where you're
taking the measurements.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:84%
This is approximately
where we are right now.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:84%
We're averaging about 1
degree Celsius right now.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Polar ice always melts
during the cycles.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It's melting a lot
right now, that's true.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.125 align:middle line:90%
But we always expect it to melt.

00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:84%
It may be melting a little more
because we may have contributed

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
to the carbon dioxide
maybe a little more.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The sun's
energy always spikes.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And as we saw, the sharp rise.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:84%
This is precisely
where we are right now.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the bottom
line is that most people

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:90%
are looking back 100, 200 years.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
seeing in the media.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.653 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yes.

00:23:40.653 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're not
looking back 5,125 years.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.255 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Here's the thing.

00:23:44.255 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Around 1880 is when consistent
records for the National

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Weather Service began.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Many of the records are from
1880 until the year 2000.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, during that time
there has been a warming,

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
both of the ocean
and the atmosphere.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:90%
It looks alarming by itself.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:01.420 align:middle line:84%
When you look at that within the
context of a world age cycle,

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:90%
it suddenly is not alarming.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:90%
It fits right into the patterns.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's about perspective.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so those records
indeed did not exist back then.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
However, we're learning that
from the polar ice caps.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line for
me is I am less concerned

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
about the physical changes
here on planet Earth.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The parameters that
we're seeing now--

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
barring some unforeseen event,
like an asteroid hitting

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, or a super flare
from the sun, or something

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
like that-- the conditions-- the
physical conditions that we're

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
experiencing now are what
our ancestors experienced

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.710 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago at
the end of their cycle

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and 5,000 years ago at the
end of the one previous.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm less concerned about
the physical changes, Lisa.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
What I'm really
concerned about is us.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:84%
How do we treat one another
as we go through the changes?

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:84%
How do we learn to work
together or to compete

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
as we go through the diminishing
resources of fresh water

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and food as the
growing season changes,

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to feed an
ever-growing population.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:84%
E.O. Wilson, a Harvard
biologist-- E.O. Wilson, very,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:90%
very well known in his field.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
share a quote that he

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:84%
has made about precisely how
unique this time in history is.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.097 align:middle line:84%
So you know that
it's not a Greggism.

00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:84%
E.O. Wilson is saying--
this is a quote-- he says,

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:84%
we're entering what he calls
a "bottleneck in time."

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I love this imagery.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:90%
A bottleneck in time.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
This narrow opening
"when our resources"--

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:84%
so he's talking about
our emotional resources,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:84%
our psychological resources,
our physical resources--

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:84%
"and our ability to solve
our problems will be pushed

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:90%
to their limits."

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot help but think
we are at the point where

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:84%
we're reaching many
of those limits now.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, this was 2005
was when he said this.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I think if you're watching
this program, every one of you

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
is going through
stuff right now.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:84%
All of our lives
are being touched

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
by the economic collapse,
global economic collapse,

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:84%
the disappearance of the ability
to grow and share food the way

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
we have in the
past, fresh water,

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and changing in climate, how we
adapt to that climate change.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.714 align:middle line:84%
All of those things are touching
every one of our lives in ways

00:26:09.714 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
maybe that we're only
beginning to understand.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.767 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Haven't those
civilizations 5,000 years ago

00:26:13.767 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:90%
had to deal with the same thing?

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.939 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
have the population.

00:26:16.939 --> 00:26:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, this is a very
good question that I've asked.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I've said, what is the
difference between us

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:90%
now and then?

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly
ancient civilizations,

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.070 align:middle line:90%
they had to deal with--

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.195 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did they do it?

00:26:25.195 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --diminishing
firewood or when

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.965 align:middle line:90%
the crops weren't growing.

00:26:28.965 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:90%
The answer is--

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Famine.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yes, they did.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But never has a
single generation

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.910 align:middle line:84%
of such technical
sophistication been

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:84%
faced with so many
different crises all

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:90%
in the same window of time.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And the experts
are telling us we

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
must solve these
very, very quickly.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, with the
economy and with the prospect

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
of global war, we've got
about 12 to 18 months

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how
to deal with this.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
That's not long to
change the way we think.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is precisely
what we're being told, is

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that we must think differently
than we've ever thought before

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and change our thinking
quickly to meet

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:84%
the demands the crises are
placing upon our world.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:84%
The beauty and the good news
is that we have good, sound,

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.370 align:middle line:84%
scientific reasons to
change our thinking.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
grasp at straws.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
New discoveries that I'm going
to share in just a moment

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:84%
are giving us very good
reasons to change the way

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:84%
we have been led to think
of ourselves in the past

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
so that we may meet these
crises with new, life-affirming,

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:90%
innovative solutions.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Not just to survive,
Lisa, but to transcend.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.372 align:middle line:84%
To become better people,
better communities.

00:27:36.372 --> 00:27:38.830 align:middle line:84%
To create a better world than
we had going into the crisis.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I'm so
passionate about what

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:41.530 align:middle line:90%
we're doing.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.238 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I so
appreciate everything

00:27:43.238 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
you're doing to bring this
to a broader audience.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And your
information as well.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.444 align:middle line:84%
That is what needs
to happen right now.

00:27:48.444 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And we're all feeling.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:84%
We're all affected by it
because we're losing our houses.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:84%
We're never going to see the
housing market the way it was.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely affecting
every single person

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:84%
at the survivalistic
level, which

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.874 align:middle line:84%
is why this information is so
important to consume right now.

00:28:03.874 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It is.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:84%
The way we have thought
about ourselves in the past

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:84%
is changing so
very, very quickly.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's obvious we are
living a time of extremes.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're being
told we must act.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.581 align:middle line:90%
My question is this-- how?

00:28:15.581 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: How.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:84%
How are we supposed to act
so differently so quickly?

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:84%
What we're really
asking is this--

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
how can we possibly
make the greatest

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.490 align:middle line:84%
choices of our survival until
we understand the deepest

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.080 align:middle line:90%
truths of our existence?

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
How can we make the
greatest choices of survival

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.180 align:middle line:84%
until we understand the deepest
truths of our existence?

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And many of those truths are
based upon false assumptions

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.220 align:middle line:84%
of science that have
been perpetuated

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.315 align:middle line:84%
for over a century, almost
a century and a half.

00:28:45.315 --> 00:28:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we're going
with all of this right now.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is perfect timing.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.354 align:middle line:90%
And keep going.

00:28:52.354 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It all comes
down to a very simple--

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.619 align:middle line:90%
deceptively simple question.

00:28:55.619 --> 00:28:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And the question on
your screen right

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.646 align:middle line:90%
now is simply this-- who am I?

00:28:59.646 --> 00:29:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Or there are many
of us together.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.494 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:29:02.494 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
this is important--

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:05.570 align:middle line:84%
people say, what
does that have to do

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:90%
with solving the big problems?

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite
you to consider

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.130 align:middle line:84%
that every challenge that's
ever crossed your path,

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:84%
every problem that
you've ever had to solve,

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:84%
every crisis that you ever
will or have experienced

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.640 align:middle line:84%
in the past, the way you have
dealt with all of these things

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.270 align:middle line:84%
all filters through
the lens of the way

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.950 align:middle line:84%
you answer this simple question,
who are you or who are we.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the way we think of
ourselves, and our relationship

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to this Earth, to our
bodies, and one another

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.020 align:middle line:84%
is the filter through which
we will choose our answers

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:90%
and create our solutions.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
, I will assert,

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:84%

your goals, has everything to

00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:46.600 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That's what this
whole series is about.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You are going to
have many guests--

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
you've had in the past,
and after I'm finished,

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
you'll have in the future--
many who are giving us new ways,

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.619 align:middle line:84%
very good ways, and sound
ways, to think about ourselves

00:29:57.619 --> 00:29:58.535 align:middle line:90%
and our relationship--

00:29:58.535 --> 00:29:59.519 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Choices, yes.

00:29:59.519 --> 00:30:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --to the world.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:84%
They may not use
the same language,

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
but this is what
we're all doing.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.621 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It' all the
same information, yeah.

00:30:04.621 --> 00:30:06.965 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I realized
early in my life

00:30:06.965 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:84%
as an engineer-- I was actually
working in the defense industry

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.610 align:middle line:84%
during the last years
of the Cold War, Lisa.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:84%
A very frightening
time in the history

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:84%
of the world behind the scenes,
when the world came unthinkably

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
close to doing the unthinkable
and unleashing nuclear weapons

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:24.340 align:middle line:90%
on civilian populations.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that time that I
began to ask myself, who am I?

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.732 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:30:28.732 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And I realized the
only way I would

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.490 align:middle line:84%
find that answer
was to go to some

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
of the most isolated,
magnificent, remote, beautiful

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.330 align:middle line:84%
places remaining on the Earth,
where that information is more

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:40.830 align:middle line:90%
intact.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been disturbed by
a modern way of thinking.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you were a part
of building those systems,

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:90%
and you had--

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I worked in a
nuclear weapons program called

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:51.405 align:middle line:84%
the Peacekeeper Missile during
the last years of the Cold--

00:30:51.405 --> 00:30:52.405 align:middle line:90%
the Peacekeeper Missile.

00:30:52.405 --> 00:30:53.822 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The name,
the Peacekeeper.

00:30:53.822 --> 00:30:55.613 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There's a
whole different program

00:30:55.613 --> 00:30:56.680 align:middle line:90%
we could do with that.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had a whole,
complete awakening around that,

00:30:59.150 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: What I came
to understand is this--

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.009 align:middle line:84%
and I'll just share
it with our listeners.

00:31:03.009 --> 00:31:04.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a story I share seldom.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.372 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about it
here and I'm happy to do it.

00:31:07.372 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It was a very frightening time
in the history of our world.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking
myself, of all people,

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:84%
why am I working behind the
scenes on a weapons project

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that I have such
emotions around?

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And I asked myself
the question, what

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:84%
would happen if we married
the wisdom of 5,000

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:84%
years of human history-- what
we've learned in 5,000 years--

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:84%
if we married that ancient
wisdom with the best

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.820 align:middle line:90%
science of today.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.150 align:middle line:84%
What if we weaved those two
ways of knowing into a greater

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.940 align:middle line:84%
understanding that would help
us prevent the kinds of wars

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that I was in the process
of working in the industry

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.794 align:middle line:90%
to support?

00:31:44.794 --> 00:31:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Where would that lead?

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:46.829 align:middle line:90%
The answer to that.

00:31:46.829 --> 00:31:48.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking on
your screen right now,

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.740 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing a collage of me.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Those are all of my images.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:84%
People have called
to my attention

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that my search to
understand our relationship

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.650 align:middle line:84%
to the world in these
traditions is actually

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.490 align:middle line:84%
documented by the length of
my hair over the years, Lisa,

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.795 align:middle line:90%
and by the color of my hair.

00:32:06.795 --> 00:32:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But my journey has
taken me into some

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:90%
of the most amazing places.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Magnificent monasteries
in the Himalayas,

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and humble mudbrick monasteries
in the mountains of Egypt,

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and amazing temples
throughout Southeast Asia.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.335 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the libraries
where the wisdom of another time

00:32:24.335 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:90%
is preserved.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And these books
in these libraries

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.290 align:middle line:84%
are actually based
on another wisdom

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
from an even older time
that's been translated

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
into so many
different traditions

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:40.210 align:middle line:84%
that I've had the
opportunity to see firsthand.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just want the
listener to look at this.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.430 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:84%
These are images from--
they no longer exist

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because they were
taken down since then.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The libraries
have been dismantled.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And many of the texts
now have disappeared

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
into private libraries
and private collections.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.100 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: These have disappeared.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And now they exist
in maybe museums.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.210 align:middle line:90%
But you get to see these here.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
you physically went.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is a
culmination of over 30 years

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:84%
of searching for
the information.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.820 align:middle line:90%
These are the texts.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But then I've had
the opportunity

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.980 align:middle line:84%
to live with the people who
practice what's in the texts.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.210 align:middle line:90%
To share meals.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.440 align:middle line:84%
To share the births of
their children coming

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.620 align:middle line:84%
into this world and the
passing of their loved ones.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I've been with them when
they've left this world.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.128 align:middle line:84%
I've been with them through
revolutions in their countries,

00:33:25.128 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:84%
where new governments came
into power during the time

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.540 align:middle line:90%
that we were there.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And through all of these
experiences, very human

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.540 align:middle line:84%
experiences, there's a
friendship, a camaraderie,

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:90%
that develops.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the presence
of that camaraderie

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that they are
comfortable sharing

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.640 align:middle line:84%
this history, the libraries,
the teachings, and what

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
it has meant to them and
how they perpetuate it.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.250 align:middle line:90%
The sadhus of Nepal.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:84%
The Tantric masters
of Northern India.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I've spent a lot of time
with the indigenous elders

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.810 align:middle line:84%
in the Andes of
Bolivia and Peru.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful shaman that
you see in the center--

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How old is that lady?

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That is a man.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And he is the shaman
that we spend time with.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.064 align:middle line:90%
And he is ageless.

00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ageless.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: If you ask that man
how old he is, he will giggle.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That's the answer.

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean,
you've said that you

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:17.739 align:middle line:84%
are aware of these indigenous
people to reach 200 years old.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: 1998, I was with
a woman in the Himalayas.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Her passport was dated 1888.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So that year she was 120 years
old and was vital, healthy.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:90%
Her color was good.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.262 align:middle line:84%
And I expect that she
still is living today.

00:34:31.262 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:90%
And she is not the oldest.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.190 align:middle line:90%
They told me there are others.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.944 align:middle line:84%
But from my personal
experience, that's

00:34:34.944 --> 00:34:36.600 align:middle line:90%
the only one that I've seen.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I've been with the indigenous
women of the world, who

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:84%
hold the feminine mysteries and
the secrets that seldom make it

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:90%
into the Western traditions.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.491 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm sharing all
of this, all of this-- I mean,

00:34:47.491 --> 00:34:49.407 align:middle line:84%
every one of those is a
story unto themselves.

00:34:49.407 --> 00:34:50.865 align:middle line:90%
It could be the whole program.

00:34:50.865 --> 00:34:52.057 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's easy
to get lost in that.

00:34:52.057 --> 00:34:52.739 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And we could do
some other programs on these.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
that our ancestors

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and the indigenous
peoples of the world

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
make room for the
cycles of life, of time,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
of history, of our relationship
to the Earth and climate.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.940 align:middle line:84%
They recognize the cycle,
so they know what to expect.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.720 align:middle line:84%
In the modern Western
way of thinking,

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.870 align:middle line:84%
this is relatively
new way of thinking,

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:84%
in terms of cycles,
because we have

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.170 align:middle line:84%
been led to believe
that life, civilization,

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.819 align:middle line:84%
human populations are
relatively linear.

00:35:23.819 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
We started primitive
a long time ago.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:25.859 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:35:25.859 --> 00:35:27.950 align:middle line:84%
One time to the pinnacle
of where we are today.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And now we know that
that simply is not true.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So for 5,000 years, our
indigenous ancestors

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:84%
have answered the question
in their way, who are we?

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:90%
For 300 years.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.885 align:middle line:84%
Now, science is a relatively new
way of thinking of our world.

00:35:39.885 --> 00:35:41.737 align:middle line:90%
It's only about 300 years old.

00:35:41.737 --> 00:35:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is new.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Science has tried to
do the same thing.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And now what I'd like
to share with you today

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:84%
is that there are a
number of key assumptions

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.880 align:middle line:84%
that science is
based upon that now

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that have been proven
false-- categorically,

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.280 align:middle line:84%
absolutely,
scientifically false.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But I've chosen five in
the book "Deep Truth"

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:90%
that I think are pivotal.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to zero in
on only a couple of them

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:84%
today just to really
drive this point home.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.606 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to briefly--
just five key assumptions.

00:36:08.606 --> 00:36:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Right now, when I was in
school, when you were in school,

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.104 align:middle line:84%
our young people in school
are being taught today--

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:84%
our listeners, you were probably
taught that evolution explains

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.260 align:middle line:84%
life in general and it
explains human life.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Number two.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.080 align:middle line:84%
That civilization's right
around 5,000, 5,500 years old--

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.830 align:middle line:84%
as we mentioned before,
it's happened once

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.262 align:middle line:84%
from a primitive to a
sophisticated pinnacle

00:36:29.262 --> 00:36:30.720 align:middle line:84%
of civilization
that we have today.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.761 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where we are now.

00:36:31.761 --> 00:36:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Number three is
that consciousness is somehow

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.120 align:middle line:84%
separate from our
physical world.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And number four is that the
space between physical things

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.030 align:middle line:90%
is somehow empty.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.525 align:middle line:90%
These two kind of work together.

00:36:42.525 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The physics
concept, yes.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Physics.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot about
quantum physics.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Number five has another
Darwinian theory

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:90%
along with number one.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.620 align:middle line:84%
That nature is based
upon a principle that

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.052 align:middle line:84%
Darwin himself called
survival of the strongest.

00:36:56.052 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:84%
It has later been interpreted
as survival of the fittest.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.979 align:middle line:84%
But his exact words were
survival of the strongest.

00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Now if you were taking
notes with this right now,

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
this very easy.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:84%
At the top of this,
write the word false

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:84%
because these are five
false assumptions.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.047 align:middle line:90%
Draw a circle.

00:37:10.047 --> 00:37:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Put a big line through it.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these is
absolutely, categorically,

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:84%
scientifically proven to be
a false assumption right now.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is being taught
in schools as we speak.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's been taught
largely as a result of habit.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.260 align:middle line:84%
The textbooks for 100
years are printed.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.100 align:middle line:84%
The curricula are
established by state.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.090 align:middle line:84%
But yes, this is-- many
of our young people

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:34.190 align:middle line:84%
now are being
steeped in the belief

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.980 align:middle line:84%
that these are the principles
that our lives are based upon.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:84%
These false
assumptions, if you want

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.580 align:middle line:84%
to know the consequences of
building a world in living

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.790 align:middle line:84%
a life based on these
false assumptions,

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.690 align:middle line:84%
you and I need look no further
than the world around us.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the things
that are collapsing

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.790 align:middle line:84%
as unsustainable ways of
life are the things that

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:84%
are based upon these
false assumptions.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.460 align:middle line:84%
The way we deal with climate
change, how we grow our food,

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.880 align:middle line:84%
the way we share our food and
resources, the economic system,

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:90%
the corporate systems.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.840 align:middle line:84%
All of these are based in
false assumptions of science.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.050 align:middle line:84%
They have all led, Lisa,
to the global extremes.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
those global extremes

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.440 align:middle line:84%
are too big to really even wrap
our hearts and minds around.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.070 align:middle line:84%
But they become
the human extremes.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They are
so extreme and they

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.940 align:middle line:84%
become so impactful that
they are impacting all of us.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
the human extremes

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.170 align:middle line:90%
become personal extremes.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:84%
We are all touched
in one way or another

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.870 align:middle line:84%
by what's happening in
the world around us.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I live in a remote area
of northern New Mexico.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
People move there
because they want

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to unplug and be away
from these crises.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And the crises are affecting
everyone everywhere,

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.760 align:middle line:84%
the way we live
every single day.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.485 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In your home town?

00:38:44.485 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Everywhere.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:45.585 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:38:45.585 --> 00:38:46.918 align:middle line:90%
What we're seeing is everywhere.

00:38:46.918 --> 00:38:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But the point that I'd
really like to share

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:54.620 align:middle line:84%
is that for people who are
not aware of a framework

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:84%
or a context, it looks like the
world is simply falling apart

00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.450 align:middle line:90%
at the seams.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:03.730 align:middle line:84%
My little mama, my
little 4'8" mom.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.439 align:middle line:84%
When she knows that I'm
going to come and do a talk,

00:39:06.439 --> 00:39:08.230 align:middle line:84%
she says, what are you
going to talk about.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.855 align:middle line:90%
And I tell her.

00:39:08.855 --> 00:39:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And she says, what can you say?

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.446 align:middle line:90%
This is a quote from my mom.

00:39:11.446 --> 00:39:13.880 align:middle line:84%
She said the world's just
gone to hell in a handbasket.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:90%
And many people believe that.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's only the unsustainable
things that are collapsing.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So when we understand
that framework--

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:90%
this is why it's important.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So for our viewers,
now, I've put together--

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.470 align:middle line:84%
this is a very simple
pyramid that tells us--

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:84%
it answers the questions
you might be asking.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, why are those five
false assumptions important?

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.240 align:middle line:90%
This is why they're important.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
This pyramid of thinking--
These six areas of thinking

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:84%
are a hierarchy of the way
we think of our relationship

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:41.961 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:39:41.961 --> 00:39:44.830 align:middle line:84%
How we think subconsciously
or consciously

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.520 align:middle line:84%
about the origin of life,
about where we come from.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:84%
About our relationship
to our body,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.820 align:middle line:90%
our relationship to the earth.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.540 align:middle line:84%
How long we've been here and
how we solve our problems.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:90%
These are all related.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:84%
The false assumptions
have led us

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:59.380 align:middle line:84%
to believe that the origin
of life is absolutely random.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That human life is
absolutely random.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.890 align:middle line:84%
That we are separate and
powerless from our own bodies.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.210 align:middle line:84%
That we are somehow separate,
independent from the earth.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.120 align:middle line:84%
That what we do in one
place has no effect

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.400 align:middle line:90%
on what we do somewhere else.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.970 align:middle line:84%
That civilization is a linear,
one way, one time happening.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.520 align:middle line:90%
That it began primitively.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It's evolved and advanced to
the point where it is today.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.750 align:middle line:84%
These are five key
false assumptions, Lisa.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And based on these
false assumptions,

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.610 align:middle line:84%
we have been led to believe that
competition and conflict are

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:31.902 align:middle line:90%
the way we solve our problems.

00:40:31.902 --> 00:40:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Struggle.

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.526 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They have led--
struggle, precisely.

00:40:34.526 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
We've been led to think of life
in the world as a struggle.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is a Darwinian
way of thinking.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share with you
and our listeners, our viewers,

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.430 align:middle line:90%
precisely where that comes from.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.850 align:middle line:84%
This is why the way we
think is so important.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It is right here on this a
hierarchical relationship

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.060 align:middle line:84%
of how we solve the
crises in our lives today.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to do, I'm going

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.120 align:middle line:84%
to zero in on two
that are related,

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:90%
both from Charles Darwin.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And then talk about
where that takes us

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.259 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to
us in our lives today.

00:41:04.259 --> 00:41:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
also think about how

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:90%
this applies to your life.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Where this is
affecting you in terms

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.135 align:middle line:84%
of your families, your
relationships, your raising

00:41:14.135 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:90%
of your children, your health.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.910 align:middle line:90%
All of those things.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Just constantly be referring
back to yourself on this

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.004 align:middle line:90%
because it is very relative.

00:41:22.004 --> 00:41:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And we can answer
some of these right now.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been led to
believe that nature is based

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
upon a model of survival of
the strongest and competition--

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.530 align:middle line:84%
you think about this--
our lives and our world

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.430 align:middle line:90%
are based upon that.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Corporate models are based
upon violent competition

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.140 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.720 align:middle line:90%
The idea is to win.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Young people in school are
less encouraged to achieve

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.890 align:middle line:84%
excellence and more
encouraged to get it right

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.220 align:middle line:90%
and to be the best.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, the testing
has gotten all about that.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.510 align:middle line:84%
The schools have basically
formed everything

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.010 align:middle line:90%
around the testing.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The economic
system of our world

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.366 align:middle line:84%
that's collapsing as you
and I speak right now

00:41:59.366 --> 00:42:01.590 align:middle line:84%
is based on a false
model of competition.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So we know precisely
where these things lead.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.022 align:middle line:90%
Let's see where this comes from.

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.480 align:middle line:84%
This is fascinating
if you've never

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.300 align:middle line:90%
thought about this before.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Up until 1859, the ideas of
our relationship to nature

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.640 align:middle line:84%
were largely left in
the realm, the purview,

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.900 align:middle line:84%
of the church and
religious traditions.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.860 align:middle line:84%
It was in 1859 Charles
Darwin, as a scientist,

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.040 align:middle line:84%
made the first
scientific attempt

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.730 align:middle line:84%
to answer some of these deep
questions of our relationship

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Because he was a scientist,
and because he was the first,

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:35.900 align:middle line:84%
the ideas were embraced quickly
by the scientific community

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.910 align:middle line:90%
and by the world.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And they became
entrenched deeply

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.680 align:middle line:90%
because he was the first.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They said because this is
science, it must be true.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why
he's so quoted.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.473 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

00:42:45.473 --> 00:42:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I think most of our
viewers are probably

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.830 align:middle line:84%
familiar with the title
of his first book.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.780 align:middle line:84%
The title on the cover,
the outside cover,

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.605 align:middle line:84%
is "The Origin of Species By
Means of Natural Selection."

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:90%
It sounds very technical.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.570 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the title
on the inner cover

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.130 align:middle line:84%
gives us insight into
Darwin's way of thinking.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Here's the rest of the cover.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:06.160 align:middle line:84%
"Or The Preservation of
Favored Races in the Struggle

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.580 align:middle line:90%
for Life."

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Darwin believed that life was a
struggle based on observations

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.660 align:middle line:90%
that he made in nature.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to apply what
he saw in some places,

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to generalize and become the
rule, the law for all life

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.680 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.121 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion--
my opinion, this

00:43:25.121 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is a Greggism-- this is
where Darwin went wrong.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.453 align:middle line:90%
I think he was a good scientist.

00:43:28.453 --> 00:43:30.230 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not down Darwin.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Darwin took the first stab
at answering the questions.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.574 align:middle line:84%
He expected his ideas
would be overturned

00:43:35.574 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and he allowed for it.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
the traditions now

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.399 align:middle line:84%
won't allow for
Darwin's ideas to fall.

00:43:40.399 --> 00:43:42.440 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that in his
writings in just a moment.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was also based
on his reality at the time.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So in my opinion, the
mistake Darwin made was he

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.290 align:middle line:84%
took some observations he
made for some forms of life

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:53.330 align:middle line:84%
in some parts of
the world, and he

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.720 align:middle line:84%
tried to generalize it
to all life everywhere,

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.580 align:middle line:84%
including you and
me and human life.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.900 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I mean by that.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to share with
you Darwin's exact words.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They're a little
flowery, but I want

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:07.840 align:middle line:84%
you to see the actual
language that he used.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Now see if this
sounds scientific.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.170 align:middle line:84%
This is from
Darwin's work, where

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:16.100 align:middle line:84%
he is suggesting that
all life emerges--

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is his rationale--
emerges from a single cell

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.364 align:middle line:84%
to become all life
that we see today.

00:44:22.364 --> 00:44:23.030 align:middle line:90%
This is a quote.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Therefore, I
should infer from analogy

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that probably all the organic
beings which have ever

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.560 align:middle line:84%
lived on this earth have
descended from some one

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:39.660 align:middle line:84%
primordial form into which
life was first breathed."

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So a scientist is
saying infer, probably.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: He's saying infer
from analogy, probably.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.440 align:middle line:84%
If this were in
a textbook today,

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.272 align:middle line:84%
it'd be laughed right
out of academia.

00:44:50.272 --> 00:44:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is the language
that he's using.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It's truly not
scientific language.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then this was
taken as law in the universe

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:56.660 align:middle line:90%
is even more interesting, yes.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.493 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

00:44:57.493 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So what he's doing
is he is saying

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:84%
that he believes that all
life originated from simpler

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.720 align:middle line:84%
forms evolved into more
and more complex forms.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a geologist
I can tell you

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that the geologic
record actually

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.440 align:middle line:90%
doesn't support that for humans.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be very
clear about this.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is a fact.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And we do see it in the fossil
record for plants, for animals.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.220 align:middle line:90%
We do not see it for humans.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.007 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
problem, I think, has arisen.

00:45:21.007 --> 00:45:22.673 align:middle line:84%
When we look at a
geologic map of time--

00:45:22.673 --> 00:45:24.730 align:middle line:84%
this is what you're seeing
on your screen right

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.270 align:middle line:84%
now-- the most
recent is at the top,

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.110 align:middle line:84%
the most ancient
is at the bottom.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.930 align:middle line:84%
About 545 million
years ago, it was

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.300 align:middle line:90%
a time called the Cambrian era.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're familiar with
the Big Bang in physics,

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:39.900 align:middle line:90%
when the universe began.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.940 align:middle line:84%
This is called the Big Bang of
Biology during this Cambrian

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.270 align:middle line:90%
explosion 545 million years ago.

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:51.720 align:middle line:84%
About 98% of all of the forms
of life that we see today

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.780 align:middle line:84%
appeared within this relatively
small window of time.

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.460 align:middle line:84%
That's not Darwinian, of
small incremental changes

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.030 align:middle line:90%
over long periods of time.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:90%
This is life in general.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing with
you just a little graph

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.999 align:middle line:84%
to give some idea
of how quickly--

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because this
is very relative

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.040 align:middle line:84%
to the entire conversation
and the entire "Deep Truth."

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.650 align:middle line:90%
So this is for life in general.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.910 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to us,
what does it mean for us?

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is certainly not
Darwin's idea of evolution.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to us, even
as recently as the fall of 2010,

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.270 align:middle line:84%
a chart very similar
to what you're seeing

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.660 align:middle line:84%
or exactly like you're
seeing on the screen right

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.910 align:middle line:84%
now was being used to show
our relationship to what

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:41.340 align:middle line:84%
are believed to be previous
forms of life that led up

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.790 align:middle line:90%
to us being where we are today.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:45.360 align:middle line:84%
On the chart you're
seeing, we're at the top.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're connected
by a lot of thin lines

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.620 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
highlight in blue

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.680 align:middle line:84%
for our listeners, our
viewers right here.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I've just highlighted
these connections.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm highlighting
these because if you

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.570 align:middle line:84%
look into the legend of this
and other graphs like this,

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:01.520 align:middle line:84%
those blue lines are
not factual lines, Lisa.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.460 align:middle line:84%
What they say are they are
speculative relationships

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.430 align:middle line:90%
or inferred relationships.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:09.390 align:middle line:84%
They are not factual
relationships.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's very little
evidence actually supporting

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we are related
to these other forms of life.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating to study them.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.820 align:middle line:90%
We learn a lot about our past.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
the new DNA studies

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.900 align:middle line:84%
now have proven scientifically
and categorically

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.882 align:middle line:84%
that we're not related
to some forms of life

00:47:29.882 --> 00:47:31.090 align:middle line:90%
that we believe that we were.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So this is all assumed?

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.562 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Inferred
or speculative.

00:47:35.562 --> 00:47:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Probably.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.644 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And
here's the problem.

00:47:37.644 --> 00:47:43.070 align:middle line:84%
If any other theories
are even mentioned

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:47.160 align:middle line:84%
in the classroom
alongside Darwin's ideas,

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.510 align:middle line:84%
teachers in the United
States are losing their jobs

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.660 align:middle line:84%
for even mentioning the
fact that an alternative

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.800 align:middle line:84%
or a competing
theory could exist.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's beginning to change.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.350 align:middle line:84%
But this is important
at any time.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It's especially important
now because as we're

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:06.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to solve the greatest
crises of our existence,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.350 align:middle line:84%
how can we do that if we
have not embraced the deepest

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:13.049 align:middle line:84%
truths of who we are in this
world and our relationship

00:48:13.049 --> 00:48:13.590 align:middle line:90%
to the world?

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.680 align:middle line:90%
And this is one area.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:90%
This is only one area.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You are shattering
a lot of beliefs with this.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.110 align:middle line:84%
You are shattering what
we've been raised to believe,

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:23.045 align:middle line:84%
what our kids are
currently being taught.

00:48:23.045 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Some.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.378 align:middle line:84%
And I think for some
people, intuitively,

00:48:25.378 --> 00:48:27.814 align:middle line:84%
it's what they've
always believed within.

00:48:27.814 --> 00:48:29.230 align:middle line:84%
They may not have
agreed with what

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:30.563 align:middle line:90%
was being taught in the schools.

00:48:30.563 --> 00:48:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to us, the
search for the missing links,

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.390 align:middle line:84%
the truth is the
missing link relating us

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:39.060 align:middle line:84%
to those other forms is
actually still missing.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:42.000 align:middle line:84%
The belief is that modern
humans came from earlier forms.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.400 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school,
such as Neanderthal

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.650 align:middle line:90%
was one that was very popular.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:49.085 align:middle line:84%
Cro-Magnon, which is now called
anatomically modern human.

00:48:49.085 --> 00:48:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But I want to share
with our viewers.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.190 align:middle line:84%
If you have not
heard of this, we now

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:57.800 align:middle line:84%
know that we are not
descendants of Neanderthal.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And we know it because
the DNA does not

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.900 align:middle line:84%
support the fact
that we could be.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:07.330 align:middle line:84%
In 1987, the body of a baby
Neanderthal girl, an infant,

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.560 align:middle line:84%
was discovered underground
in a cave in northern Europe

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.840 align:middle line:84%
in a rare state of
preservation, very rare.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.240 align:middle line:84%
She was carbon dated
to 30,000 years old.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, we had a
30,000-year-old Neanderthal

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.040 align:middle line:84%
infant that was at one time
believed to be our ancestor.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.220 align:middle line:90%
She was preserved so well.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Her hair, her skin, her DNA.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:32.694 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we had her
DNA to compare it to ours.

00:49:32.694 --> 00:49:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm just going to
cut to the bottom line,

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:38.780 align:middle line:84%
the last sentence, from the very
prestigious journal, "Nature,"

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.950 align:middle line:90%
that published in the year 2000.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Volume 404, page 490,
in the year 2000.

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:45.970 align:middle line:90%
This is the conclusion.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "The results suggest that
modern human was not, in fact,

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.490 align:middle line:90%
descended from Neanderthals."

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And since that time, 40
more Neanderthal bodies

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:55.420 align:middle line:90%
have been found.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And the DNA has supported
this conclusion.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:59.690 align:middle line:90%
So now we know who we're not.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.570 align:middle line:84%
We are not descended
from Neanderthal.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why isn't
this more mainstream?

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Why hasn't this turned
science on its head?

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.984 align:middle line:90%
This was in 2000.

00:50:08.984 --> 00:50:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: One of the
reasons, in all fairness,

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.730 align:middle line:84%
it takes a long time
for new discoveries

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:16.870 align:middle line:84%
to trickle down into what's
commonly accepted in the world.

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.680 align:middle line:84%
That would be
important any time.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're being told we
don't have decades to do this.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.420 align:middle line:84%
We've got to redefine our
relationship to the world.

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
one small piece.

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:29.622 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to go somewhere
with this very quickly.

00:50:29.622 --> 00:50:30.705 align:middle line:90%
But we know who we're not.

00:50:30.705 --> 00:50:32.371 align:middle line:84%
We're not descendants
from Neanderthals.

00:50:32.371 --> 00:50:34.940 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we walked
the Earth with Neanderthal.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.150 align:middle line:84%
If we shared the
Earth with them,

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:37.733 align:middle line:84%
we could not have
descended from them.

00:50:37.733 --> 00:50:40.000 align:middle line:84%
That now is scientific
fact and we know that.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So here's another
graph on your screen.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.380 align:middle line:84%
We are in the center
at the very top.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And what we know is that the
form of modern human as we

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:52.020 align:middle line:84%
are today, we appeared
relatively suddenly

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:53.677 align:middle line:90%
about 200,000 years ago.

00:50:53.677 --> 00:50:55.010 align:middle line:90%
We used to be called Cro-Magnon.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And now we are called
anatomically modern human

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:58.200 align:middle line:90%
because we are.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.710 align:middle line:90%
That describes us.

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:02.080 align:middle line:84%
We haven't changed,
Lisa, in 200,000 years.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.049 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:05.090 align:middle line:84%
If you take their skeleton
and put it next to you

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.927 align:middle line:84%
and me, except for
thicker leg bones,

00:51:06.927 --> 00:51:08.760 align:middle line:84%
for all intents and
purposes we're the same.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.800 align:middle line:90%
That is not Darwinian evolution.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.917 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
where we came from.

00:51:12.917 --> 00:51:14.750 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to get
to the bottom of this,

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we've got to understand what
happened 200,000 years ago.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer.

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But I know that the
Darwinian theory of evolution

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.620 align:middle line:90%
is not explaining it.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And the new theories are being
discouraged or, in some cases,

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.450 align:middle line:90%
not even allowed to be shared.

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:30.484 align:middle line:84%
So we have a whole
generation of young people

00:51:30.484 --> 00:51:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that want to dedicate
their lives to answering

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.490 align:middle line:84%
the great questions
of our existence.

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.550 align:middle line:84%
They're being required to do
so within a limited framework

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:39.710 align:middle line:84%
of what we already know
as obsolete science.

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So where are
we going with this?

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't know
where we come from.

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.741 align:middle line:90%
This is still the missing link.

00:51:45.741 --> 00:51:46.740 align:middle line:90%
It's still undetermined.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think DNA is
going to tell the story.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Eventually.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Rather than a
family tree, my sense,

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.560 align:middle line:84%
my Greggism sense,
is that we're not

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.726 align:middle line:90%
going to have a family tree.

00:51:52.726 --> 00:51:54.290 align:middle line:90%
I think we have a family bush.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small
bush and we're it.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are
our own species.

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Derived from where?

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: In the book I talk
about some of the DNA studies.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And what scientists are
saying-- geneticists publish

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:11.050 align:middle line:84%
this in genetics journals-- are
saying that specifically human

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:13.310 align:middle line:84%
chromosome number
two, that allows

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:15.940 align:middle line:84%
us to be so much of
who we are, could not

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.910 align:middle line:84%
have happened by natural
evolutionary processes.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:84%
That something happened to fuse
the genes in the way that they

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.520 align:middle line:84%
are that cannot be
explained by natural terms.

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.520 align:middle line:90%
They have to stop there.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.130 align:middle line:84%
They can't go any
further because they

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:30.640 align:middle line:90%
don't know what else to say.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.580 align:middle line:84%
They're saying,
factually, it could not

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.400 align:middle line:84%
have happened through
evolutionary processes.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.880 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot more to this.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.040 align:middle line:84%
In the interest of time, we're
going through this quickly.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is a whole, right,
subject within itself, yes.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.524 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But, here's
what Darwin said.

00:52:43.524 --> 00:52:45.575 align:middle line:84%
He expected his ideas
would be overturned.

00:52:45.575 --> 00:52:47.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, "If it
could be demonstrated

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that any complex organ existed
which could not possibly

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.280 align:middle line:84%
have been formed by
numerous, successive, slight

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.480 align:middle line:84%
modifications," he
says, "my theory

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.740 align:middle line:90%
would absolutely break down."

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't even
talked about DNA yet.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.900 align:middle line:90%
DNA chain.

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Darwin could not
possibly have known

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.720 align:middle line:84%
in his time about the cells
and the DNA like we do in ours.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.700 align:middle line:84%
He expected his ideas
to be overturned.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:12.529 align:middle line:84%
And it's not being allowed in
mainstream media, academia,

00:53:12.529 --> 00:53:14.320 align:middle line:84%
classrooms, textbooks,
and teachings today.

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:15.736 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not
being challenged.

00:53:15.736 --> 00:53:17.520 align:middle line:90%
It's being presented as fact.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.020 align:middle line:90%
As history.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And any alternative
or competing theories

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.929 align:middle line:84%
that suggest something
else are not being allowed.

00:53:22.929 --> 00:53:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that's
the problem, because we

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.290 align:middle line:84%
have brilliant minds, beautiful
hearts of a whole generation

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.956 align:middle line:84%
of young people, that are
about to be unleashed to answer

00:53:30.956 --> 00:53:32.580 align:middle line:84%
the deepest questions
of our existence.

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That are asking.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And they're
being required

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:36.764 align:middle line:84%
to do so within the limited
parameters of what we already

00:53:36.764 --> 00:53:38.370 align:middle line:84%
know is a false and
obsolete science.

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why
this program exists.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Deep truth.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.396 align:middle line:84%
This is our first deep truth,
beyond any reasonable doubt.

00:53:42.396 --> 00:53:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Evolution doesn't
describe and explain

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.620 align:middle line:90%
life itself or human life.

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:50.190 align:middle line:84%
But this leads to the
second Darwinian concept

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:52.610 align:middle line:84%
that I believe is
wreaking the greatest

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.510 align:middle line:84%
havoc upon our lives
and our world today.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.710 align:middle line:84%
From your family dinner
tables to the collapse

00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:00.550 align:middle line:84%
of the global economic system,
I think it's based in this idea.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Darwin believed that when
he looked into nature,

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and he saw the way
certain insects or animals

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.410 align:middle line:84%
behaved in one location,
that he was looking

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:15.190 align:middle line:84%
at small expressions in that
place of a greater law that

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:18.360 align:middle line:84%
applied to every
life everywhere.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So for example, he said-- and
I love it when he does this.

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.990 align:middle line:84%
He starts this
explanation by saying

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.170 align:middle line:84%
it may not be logical
to think this way.

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:28.479 align:middle line:84%
So even he's got a question
while he's saying it.

00:54:28.479 --> 00:54:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a qualifier.

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: This is a quote.

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.300 align:middle line:84%
He says, "it may not
be a logical deduction.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:35.320 align:middle line:84%
But to my imagination,"
Darwin says,

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.660 align:middle line:84%
"it's far more satisfactory
to look at these competing

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:84%
instincts, such as young birds
ejecting their foster brothers

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.654 align:middle line:90%
or sisters from the nest."

00:54:44.654 --> 00:54:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Two birds in the nest.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Another bird comes
that's different.

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:48.473 align:middle line:84%
And they eject it
and leave it to die.

00:54:48.473 --> 00:54:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Or ants making slaves
out of other ants

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.020 align:middle line:84%
because they are more
powerful and they can.

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:57.740 align:middle line:84%
He says he is looking at these
"as small consequences of one

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.320 align:middle line:84%
general law leading to the
advancement of all beings

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.140 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:05.070 align:middle line:84%
That law is multiply, very,
let the strongest live,

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.250 align:middle line:90%
and the weakest die."

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Let the strongest live
and the weakest die.

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:14.057 align:middle line:84%
This is such a
dangerous way to think.

00:55:14.057 --> 00:55:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you're wondering
how dangerous,

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.140 align:middle line:84%
you look at the consequences
of this in the world around us.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.639 align:middle line:84%
Our corporate systems are
based upon the competition,

00:55:21.639 --> 00:55:23.430 align:middle line:84%
let the strongest live
and the weakest die.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.370 align:middle line:84%
The economic system that is
breaking and wreaking havoc

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and causing suffering
throughout the world.

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The way that we are dealing
with diminishing resources,

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:35.380 align:middle line:84%
how we share them and
how we help one another,

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.600 align:middle line:90%
all based upon these ideas.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.746 align:middle line:84%
We have just emerged
from the 20th century.

00:55:40.746 --> 00:55:43.380 align:middle line:84%
If you think about what we
were talking about here,

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.910 align:middle line:90%
this was 1859.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:49.270 align:middle line:84%
The modern world is largely
based upon Darwinian ideas.

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most
distorted and twisted acts

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.980 align:middle line:84%
of atrocity of
human against human

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.641 align:middle line:90%
occurred in the 20th century.

00:55:56.641 --> 00:55:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have to go
into what all they are.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Our listeners know
and our viewers know.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But many of them were
justified, they said,

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.250 align:middle line:84%
because Darwin based
this in science,

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:11.290 align:middle line:84%
it must be OK for us to treat
our fellow humans the way

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:13.020 align:middle line:90%
that we're treating them.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Or in some cases,
exterminate them.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Let the strongest live
and the weakest die.

00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:20.190 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the way we
deal with climate change.

00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:22.730 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it as a
competitive battle that

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:24.620 align:middle line:84%
must be won rather
than something that we

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.880 align:middle line:90%
adapt to as a natural change.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.644 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this was just a
small part of what Darwin said.

00:56:29.644 --> 00:56:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It is.

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a small part.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:34.622 align:middle line:84%
But it became a very powerful,
dominant part of the teaching.

00:56:34.622 --> 00:56:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of our culture.

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And it is
deeply entrenched

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.660 align:middle line:90%
into our world today.

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is just part
of the deep truths.

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Now the good news.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the good news,
because there is good news.

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: The good news.

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:47.920 align:middle line:84%
In the late 20th, now
early 20th century--

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.750 align:middle line:84%
21st century, over 400
peer-reviewed studies

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:54.300 align:middle line:84%
asked a single question--
what's the optimum amount

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.960 align:middle line:84%
of competition in the
classroom, in the workplace,

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.110 align:middle line:90%
on the playing field?

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Violent competition, not a
friendly game of checkers.

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:04.570 align:middle line:84%
All 400 studies came back
with the same answer.

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Alfie Khan, in his book,
"No Contest-- The Case

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Against Competition,"
described this.

00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a quote.
"The ideal amount

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.462 align:middle line:84%
of competition in
any environment,

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:13.920 align:middle line:84%
in the classroom,
in the workplace,

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.669 align:middle line:84%
in the family, the
playing field, is none.

00:57:15.669 --> 00:57:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Competition always, always,
always is destructive."

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:middle line:84%
That is followed by
a very prestigious--

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:26.180 align:middle line:84%
an article in a very prestigious
journal, "New Scientist."

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.314 align:middle line:84%
Michael Le Page,
this was in 2008.

00:57:29.314 --> 00:57:29.980 align:middle line:90%
This is a quote.

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, "What we
see in the wild

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.054 align:middle line:90%
is not every animal for itself."

00:57:34.054 --> 00:57:36.470 align:middle line:84%
That's very different than
what we've been led to believe.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:38.011 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what
Darwin said, yeah.

00:57:38.011 --> 00:57:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: He said, "Cooperation
is an incredibly successful

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.270 align:middle line:90%
survival strategy.

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:44.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when
cooperation breaks down,

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:47.170 align:middle line:84%
the results can
become disastrous."

00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:49.640 align:middle line:84%
If you're wondering
where you can

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.040 align:middle line:84%
see a good example
of cooperation,

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.350 align:middle line:84%
you need look no further
than the body that

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:57.480 align:middle line:84%
houses the soul that is
watching this program.

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Because your body is made up
of over 50 trillion cells.

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And those cells
must cooperatively

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:08.220 align:middle line:84%
work together in a very precise
way to allow you your life.

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And when that
cooperation breaks down,

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.369 align:middle line:90%
the results are disastrous.

00:58:11.369 --> 00:58:12.910 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
beautiful examples

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:15.517 align:middle line:84%
in nature of where
cooperation is so vital.

00:58:15.517 --> 00:58:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies always have an
innate ability to heal itself.

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:23.070 align:middle line:84%
That is, it's always
attempting its highest order

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:25.184 align:middle line:84%
to achieve coherence
within the body.

00:58:25.184 --> 00:58:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And we're just
touching the surface.

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.391 align:middle line:90%
This is the tip of the iceberg.

00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But we're doing this,
Lisa, to get somewhere.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.980 align:middle line:84%
To share with our
viewers that not all

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of the truths that we've
been led to believe

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.190 align:middle line:90%
are actually truths.

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And the science is
overturning them.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, this might
be a psychology question,

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:45.470 align:middle line:84%
but isn't the human psyche
hardwired for competition?

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I know that-- Is it really
all based on this scientific--

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.058 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We're
hardwired for excellence.

00:58:50.058 --> 00:58:51.157 align:middle line:90%
We want to do well.

00:58:51.157 --> 00:58:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And what you're going to see--
and this will take us into this

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:57.470 align:middle line:84%
next section very quickly
because violent competition

00:58:57.470 --> 00:59:00.990 align:middle line:84%
among people, that we have
been led to believe is actually

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.920 align:middle line:84%
fundamental in human
nature, interestingly,

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.060 align:middle line:84%
we do not see the evidence of
it in the archaeological record

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:10.640 align:middle line:84%
in the 5,000-year cycle
that proceeds this cycle.

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.570 align:middle line:84%
It's only this 5,000-year
cycle where we see the evidence

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:18.100 align:middle line:84%
of large scale war, the evidence
of weapons, mass graves,

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:18.970 align:middle line:90%
mutilated bodies.

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:22.810 align:middle line:84%
We see no evidence of that,
no walls around the cities,

00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:25.420 align:middle line:84%
no moats protecting the
cities, no evidence of weapons

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.270 align:middle line:90%
prior to 5,000 years.

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Although as you're
going to see, we

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:31.350 align:middle line:84%
do see evidence of advanced
civilization in that time.

00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Scientific evidence.

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:32.915 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fascinating.

00:59:32.915 --> 00:59:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So war, it did not exist back
in-- prior to the 5,125-year

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:39.190 align:middle line:90%
cycle that we're ending.

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: One of two
things is happening.

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Either we haven't
found the evidence yet,

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.210 align:middle line:84%
which I have to say is
possible, although I doubt it

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:46.600 align:middle line:84%
because so much
evidence is out there.

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
humans never fought.

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:51.750 align:middle line:84%
But the large scale
war, defending--

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The need for defense.

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --huge armies.

00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Solving their problems with
a neighboring community

00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.350 align:middle line:84%
with huge armies
destroying one another,

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.030 align:middle line:84%
we see no evidence of
that prior to 5,000 years.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And these are in these
civilizations we're going

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.590 align:middle line:90%
to see the photos of--

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:06.298 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: We are.

01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that are
currently even going

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.390 align:middle line:90%
under archaeological digs.

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So what we know now is nature
is based on cooperation, not

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.050 align:middle line:90%
competition.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It's actually based on
what is called mutual aid

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and cooperation,
not competition.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.815 align:middle line:84%
And I may not be doing
justice to the topic

01:00:22.815 --> 01:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
because there's actually
much more to it than this.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.495 align:middle line:84%
But we're doing this is
at a very high level just

01:00:26.495 --> 01:00:27.661 align:middle line:90%
to introduce some new ideas.

01:00:27.661 --> 01:00:28.880 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a workshop.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.170 align:middle line:90%
This is--

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm also very
curious because what Darwin

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
did say does exist
with the ants,

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
creating the armies and
slaves out of their own kind

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and with the birds pushing
out the birds from the nest.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
That does exist.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Competition happens
under specific instances.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But it is not the
overarching rule of nature.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the new
discoveries are showing.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
about to show us that.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So now we're looking at
these false assumptions.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.720 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
that civilization

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
itself began about
5,000 years ago.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And people say, what's
the big deal about that?

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Whether it began a million years
or 5,000 years, why do we care?

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
because of the cycles.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
If we are living this rare
pivotal moment in the cycle

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:15.219 align:middle line:84%
now, and civilizations
and humans like you

01:01:15.219 --> 01:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and me have lived
through this in the past,

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.460 align:middle line:90%
we can learn from them.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And it may give us
some insights into how

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:23.260 align:middle line:84%
to deal with these crises
because they're rare.

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We won't see this for
another 5,000 years,

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:27.416 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of changes
were living now.

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:28.290 align:middle line:90%
When I was in school.

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:30.249 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, probably when
you were in school.

01:01:30.249 --> 01:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Our viewers, when
you were in school,

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
we talked about history,
you probably saw a graph.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Something like the one
you're seeing on your screen

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
right now that says
that civilization began

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:42.910 align:middle line:84%
in the Mesopotamian
Valley, ancient Sumeria,

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:44.710 align:middle line:90%
around 5,500 years ago.

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And everything else is more
recent-- ancient Egypt,

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:52.680 align:middle line:84%
the Indus Valley in
India, the area of India,

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Greece, Rome all of that.

01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:57.022 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this is the
data no longer supports it,

01:01:57.022 --> 01:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
but this is still what's
being taught in the classroom.

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.166 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, when
you're learning

01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:02.801 align:middle line:84%
that, you don't know to
challenge that at that time.

01:02:02.801 --> 01:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: No, but
I'd like to share.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those places
where this whole program could

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
be, and I would be very
excited to share, only

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:11.790 align:middle line:90%
the archaeological discoveries.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
something about us

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that's really drawn
to the ancient, Lisa.

01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense,
and I think there's

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
a yearning, and a longing,
to connect our lives today

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:25.519 align:middle line:84%
with the continuity of something
that has come before us.

01:02:25.519 --> 01:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
this is so powerful.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to give
a couple of examples.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.196 align:middle line:84%
And there's much
more in the book.

01:02:30.196 --> 01:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Much more that we
actually could do.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is exciting.

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: So 5,500 years.

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I personally have had the
opportunity to document.

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
In northern Peru
right now, there's

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
an ongoing archaeological
site 150 acres,

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
five pyramids, two
circular plazas.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.480 align:middle line:84%
A mysterious advanced
civilization.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
they came from.

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:54.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was there, the dates
actually came in for this site.

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
This that you're looking at is
actually an aerial view of one

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.160 align:middle line:90%
of these sites.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.730 align:middle line:90%
The site is called Caral, Peru.

01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:03.540 align:middle line:90%
The date came in.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.373 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we're
taught that civilization

01:03:05.373 --> 01:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
began in a primitive
state 5,500 years ago.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
This site collapsed when
we're told civilization began.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
This advanced site is at least
7,000 years old and collapsed

01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years later
around 5,000 years ago.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It's now dated between 7,000
and 5,000 years before present.

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
This now is the oldest
site in all the Americas.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.947 align:middle line:84%
Older than the Inca, than
the Aztec, than the Maya.

01:03:27.947 --> 01:03:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This site in Peru.

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: In Peru.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's rewriting
the history books.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:32.859 align:middle line:90%
But it's only one site.

01:03:32.859 --> 01:03:35.233 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to cut the
chase and go to the oldest site

01:03:35.233 --> 01:03:35.920 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wait, wait.

01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I just have to ask.

01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
You're there in Peru
when that data came in?

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There's a whole
story I could share.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And how are we doing on time?

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What did you do?

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.670 align:middle line:90%
We have time.

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The day that I
was here with our guide

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
in this very isolated,
remote, colorless land, where

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
the sky is the same
color as the earth,

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is the same color as the
stone and the temples,

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
is the same color of the
plants that are still there.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.476 align:middle line:90%
They don't grow green.

01:04:03.476 --> 01:04:05.400 align:middle line:84%
They grow the
color of the earth.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
The Caral Cactus.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.420 align:middle line:84%
He had cell coverage
for his cellphone.

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And while we were there,
his cellphone rang.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was the laboratories that
had been independently dating--

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:20.210 align:middle line:84%
three independent laboratories
dating organic material that

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
had come from deep
inside these remains.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that one of
two things would happen.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Either this would become
just another Incan site--

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.556 align:middle line:84%
a very cool Incan site--
dated with everything else.

01:04:31.556 --> 01:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Or it would be the oldest
site in all the Americas.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And I saw he turned
his back to me.

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:38.275 align:middle line:84%
And as he turned back around,
he had a huge smile on his face

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and I knew what the
answer would be.

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
That was the day we
discovered that this

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
was dated between 5,000
years and 7,000 years BP,

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Before Present.

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Older than any of
these sites should be.

01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What did you do?

01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Did you sit down?

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.687 align:middle line:84%
What did you do when you
found that information?

01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: In all honesty--

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you remember?

01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --I wasn't surprised.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.200 align:middle line:90%
I had a sense.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I actually felt
relieved because I

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
had a sense what
I was seeing here.

01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And the archaeologist
that I was talking to,

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to tell me
what had been found.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
I was frustrating him
with the questions

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.190 align:middle line:84%
that I was asking that
he couldn't answer.

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.949 align:middle line:90%
Who built it?

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Where are the bodies?

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Are there any weapons?

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:18.130 align:middle line:90%
No walls fortifying this area.

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.277 align:middle line:90%
Who were these people?

01:05:19.277 --> 01:05:20.235 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't answer.

01:05:20.235 --> 01:05:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we don't know
the answer to those questions.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But there's a mathematics,
there's an architecture,

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:27.130 align:middle line:90%
there's a way of agriculture.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, astronomical markers
very apparent that are here.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
This was an advanced
civilization.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
These people knew
things that we're only

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.630 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand.

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And they helped to
understand the bridge.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.736 align:middle line:84%
When we see the Maya,
for example, and we say,

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:41.610 align:middle line:90%
how did they do this?

01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:42.701 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:43.325 align:middle line:90%
Out of nowhere?

01:05:43.325 --> 01:05:44.366 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't out of nowhere.

01:05:44.366 --> 01:05:46.370 align:middle line:84%
They were bridged from
other civilizations

01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:48.475 align:middle line:84%
that we simply are not
aware of and are only now

01:05:48.475 --> 01:05:50.030 align:middle line:90%
are becoming aware of.

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is the value of
going to a place like this.

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.490 align:middle line:90%
The oldest site in the world.

01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, there may be
others that are older.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
oldest scientifically

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
dated, peer-reviewed
and accepted dated site

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:05.070 align:middle line:90%
in the world now is in Turkey.

01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a place called
Gobekli Tepe, Turkey.

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:09.610 align:middle line:90%
This is an amazing site.

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:13.958 align:middle line:84%
It was rediscovered by a
German archaeologist in 2004.

01:06:13.958 --> 01:06:17.387 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered in the '60s
by an American archaeologist.

01:06:17.387 --> 01:06:18.720 align:middle line:90%
He didn't believe what he found.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
He walked away from the
discovery of a lifetime.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:22.476 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: He didn't believe.

01:06:22.476 --> 01:06:24.090 align:middle line:90%
He said it can't be this old.

01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:27.192 align:middle line:90%
And he walked away from it.

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He's kicking himself.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: A German archaeologist
now is excavating this site.

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
They are underground sites, at
least 15 to 20 circular temples

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
have been seen in the
earth-imaging radar

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.090 align:middle line:90%
underground.

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Four or five now
have been excavated.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And of those four or five,
this is what we're looking at.

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, this
site was intentionally

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:51.950 align:middle line:90%
buried, Lisa, 8,000 years ago.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:55.280 align:middle line:90%
It's older than 8,000 years.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was buried 8,000 years
ago and because of that,

01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:59.840 align:middle line:84%
everything was
preserved very well.

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Look at the detail that
we're seeing on these glyphs,

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.181 align:middle line:90%
on these temples.

01:07:06.181 --> 01:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now when
an archaeologist

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
goes in and discovers
this, does he

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
maintain that and
bring in people?

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
How does that work, if
you don't mind me asking?

01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:17.525 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, the government
becomes very active in this.

01:07:17.525 --> 01:07:17.677 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Involved.

01:07:17.677 --> 01:07:18.240 align:middle line:90%
I see.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Usually an academic
institution is part of this.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.199 align:middle line:84%
It's peer reviewed, which
means that his findings,

01:07:24.199 --> 01:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
other scientists
have to look at them

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.296 align:middle line:84%
and see if he's made
a mistake somewhere.

01:07:28.296 --> 01:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Where we are with
this right now.

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
They haven't even gotten
to the oldest part of this.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But what they have
gotten to right now

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:39.750 align:middle line:84%
is being dated between 11,300
and 11,500 years before today.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:41.000 align:middle line:90%
That's twice as old--

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As we're taught.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --as what
you and I were taught.

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
What our young people
are being taught.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At school today.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: However, it
also opens the door

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:48.090 align:middle line:90%
to another possibility.

01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back.

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Here is our map
that we just looked

01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
at of what we've been taught
is the history of civilization,

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:55.047 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years.

01:07:55.047 --> 01:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's plug in some
of these new dates.

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:58.379 align:middle line:84%
Some of them we haven't
even talked about.

01:07:58.379 --> 01:08:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Here's Caral,
around 5,000 years.

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Catalhoyuk we haven't
talked about, in Turkey.

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Gobekli Tepe we did.

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:08.140 align:middle line:84%
A site in India now,
9,500 years old.

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.890 align:middle line:90%
But look at this.

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
The blue that you
see on your screen

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.950 align:middle line:84%
is what scientists accept as
the end of the last ice age,

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:17.050 align:middle line:90%
about 12,000 years ago.

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
When the ice age
ended, the weather

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.575 align:middle line:84%
was unstable for
about 4,000 years.

01:08:20.575 --> 01:08:21.450 align:middle line:90%
They had a big storm.

01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:22.960 align:middle line:90%
A lot of rain.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.529 align:middle line:84%
Warming for 4,000
years that you're

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:27.960 align:middle line:84%
seeing in the white on
your screen right now.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
If we overlay 5,000 year
markers onto this map of time,

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.870 align:middle line:84%
something very
interesting happens.

01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like we've been
speaking about the cycles.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.958 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The dark lines
that we're seeing now.

01:08:38.958 --> 01:08:41.790 align:middle line:84%
We're saying we're at the last
years of a rare and mysterious

01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:45.689 align:middle line:84%
5,000-year cycle
that began 3114 BC.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
There was another cycle before
that around 10,000 years ago.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous ancestors told
us there were four cycles.

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
If we go back four
cycles and we overlay

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:56.022 align:middle line:84%
that right here, what we're
seeing is that the history

01:08:56.022 --> 01:08:57.855 align:middle line:84%
that we've been taught,
it's not the history

01:08:57.855 --> 01:08:59.410 align:middle line:90%
of the whole world forever.

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the history of the most
recent cycle, the 5,000 years.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's another cycle
of 5,000 years where

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:06.680 align:middle line:90%
these new sites are coming up.

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
advanced civilizations

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
emerging from or very
near the ice age.

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:13.604 align:middle line:90%
And this changes everything.

01:09:13.604 --> 01:09:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:15.479 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It changes everything.

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, where this gets especially
interesting and relevant

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.729 align:middle line:84%
to the Darwinian theories,
it's only in the most recent

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
5,000-year cycle that we have
evidence of large scale war,

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:26.644 align:middle line:84%
violent competition
to solve our problems.

01:09:26.644 --> 01:09:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is fascinating.

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And our
indigenous ancestors tell us

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.763 align:middle line:84%
that we are living what they
call the cycle of darkness,

01:09:31.763 --> 01:09:32.649 align:middle line:90%
the cycle of war.

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:35.279 align:middle line:84%
The cycle before this
was a golden age.

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And they say the
cycle that we are now

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
about to enter after 2012 could
be the next golden age if we

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:46.529 align:middle line:84%
make the choices to
recognize and embrace

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to the earth
and the deep truths of nature.

01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just have to
say, coming from you,

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
and who you are, working in
defense and building weapons,

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and a part of that, to
going on your journey--

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It makes me cry
when I think about it.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just looking at
this and your journey.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We must
embrace these deepest

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:06.769 align:middle line:90%
truths of our existence.

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.310 align:middle line:84%
In all honesty, I
think we sense them

01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:10.490 align:middle line:84%
in our hearts, which is
right where we're going.

01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
We've been conditioned and led
to believe something very, very

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:16.640 align:middle line:84%
different than what the facts
now are sharing with us.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's no
accident that only now,

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.280 align:middle line:84%
when we are faced with the
greatest crises that threaten

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
our survival, that the
same science that tells us

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
about the crises is taking us
right back into our hearts.

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I'd
like to go with this.

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.533 align:middle line:84%
Do we have time
to do that today?

01:10:30.533 --> 01:10:31.324 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:10:31.324 --> 01:10:32.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the most important thing.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So what we
can say now is this.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Is we know that civilization
is at least two times older

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:40.842 align:middle line:90%
than traditionally acknowledged.

01:10:40.842 --> 01:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Here's why that
makes a difference.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.000 align:middle line:90%
The deep truths.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.950 align:middle line:90%
We go back to this pyramid.

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
If we think of the origin
of life as non-random

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and the origin of human life
as non-random, and that we

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:52.420 align:middle line:84%
are connected and linked to
our bodies as these studies

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.311 align:middle line:90%
suggest.

01:10:53.311 --> 01:10:54.810 align:middle line:84%
A relationship to
the world is we're

01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:56.130 align:middle line:90%
connected and independent.

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And civilization is cyclic.

01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, competition and
conflict no longer makes sense.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It makes tremendous sense
to cooperate and create

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
what's called mutual aid.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:06.110 align:middle line:90%
The data supports it.

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:08.707 align:middle line:84%
This is why the way we think
about ourselves is so vitally

01:11:08.707 --> 01:11:09.540 align:middle line:90%
important right now.

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors somehow knew
this, Lisa, long before we did.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
They took these
one step further.

01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you would think about
it, it is really common sense.

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It is.

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It really is.

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Intuitively.

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, intuitively.

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They carried these
truths one step further.

01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
They said in the
darkest times of life,

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.130 align:middle line:84%
together-- this is the
key-- working together,

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:30.736 align:middle line:84%
we can tip the scales of
life in peace in our favor.

01:11:30.736 --> 01:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And that they told us
precisely how to do it.

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:34.290 align:middle line:84%
What they said,
it's all about what

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.820 align:middle line:90%
we call life's longest journey.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking on
your screen right now,

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.678 align:middle line:84%
I think you probably know
what this journey is.

01:11:39.678 --> 01:11:42.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the journey that
averages 18 inches

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
from the center of our
logic-based mind right

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
into the core of that
beautiful heart that

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is at the center of your being
as we share this with you

01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:52.150 align:middle line:90%
today.

01:11:52.150 --> 01:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The average 18
inches on each human.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Anyone who's ever made
the decision to volunteer,

01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:00.500 align:middle line:90%
to help weaker people.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's ever been
a place of service

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.260 align:middle line:90%
understands that journey.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I think so.

01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors, this is
something they left us with.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But our own science
now is telling us why.

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:13.467 align:middle line:84%
And if you have not heard this
as a viewer, this is important.

01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:15.300 align:middle line:84%
When you were in school
and I was in school,

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.175 align:middle line:84%
we were taught the brain
is the master organ.

01:12:17.175 --> 01:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
That the brain is
where the electrical

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetic information
from our body's the strongest.

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Electrical and
magnetic generators.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Now what we know
in the human body.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that the human heart
is the strongest generator.

01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
That our heart is about 100
times stronger than the brain

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.820 align:middle line:90%
electrically.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
It's 5,000 times stronger
than the brain magnetically.

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
because we live in a world

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:39.900 align:middle line:84%
where we are influenced
by the magnetic

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and the electrical
fields of this Earth.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to tip the scales
of emotion, and thinking,

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:48.199 align:middle line:84%
and peace, and cooperation,
and balance in our favor,

01:12:48.199 --> 01:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
it makes perfect
sense, Lisa, that we

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.989 align:middle line:84%
would need to communicate
with the fields that connect

01:12:51.989 --> 01:12:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and sustain all life, and
use the one organ in our body

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:56.440 align:middle line:90%
that's designed to do just that.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's not our brain.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.680 align:middle line:90%
It's our heart.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
This is where some of the
most cherished traditions

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
of our past now overlap the
beauty of the best science

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and the honest science
of today, if we're

01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:09.960 align:middle line:84%
really honest with where
the science is leading us.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're
learning that there are--

01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:11.958 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: And we're learning.

01:13:11.958 --> 01:13:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So I've put together
just a little

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
section here I'd like to
share with our viewers.

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And then lead us
through an experience

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:20.390 align:middle line:84%
of exactly what this
heart connection is

01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:21.195 align:middle line:84%
all about in the
next few minutes.

01:13:21.195 --> 01:13:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK if we do that?

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.091 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:13:23.091 --> 01:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I-- All
that we learned just now

01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is just a crash course
in going from our school

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.250 align:middle line:90%
all the way up to now.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's bring this home now.

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring this to where we
can use this in everyday life.

01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, in all
of your relationships--

01:13:39.630 --> 01:13:42.570 align:middle line:84%
in your relationship with
yourself, with your children,

01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
with the people that you
work with, with your economy,

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:48.680 align:middle line:84%
with our universe,
with our entire world--

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
this is how this
all comes together.

01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:53.475 align:middle line:84%
And it comes together with
the space of the heart.

01:13:53.475 --> 01:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, what
we've just encapsulated

01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
in these brief few moments is
that it's not our imagination.

01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
We are living in this rare
pivotal moment of crisis

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.480 align:middle line:84%
where the outcome can create
a better life, a better

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.769 align:middle line:84%
world than we had
going into the crisis.

01:14:08.769 --> 01:14:10.310 align:middle line:84%
We've been asked to
think differently

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:11.850 align:middle line:84%
about ourselve to
solve the crises.

01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And I've just shared some
very good scientific reasons

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.600 align:middle line:90%
to do just that.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Those reasons now lead us
back into a way of being,

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:22.800 align:middle line:84%
as well as a way
of thinking, that's

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
centered in our hearts, that
allows us to tip those scales.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's probably no
secret to anyone watching this.

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.427 align:middle line:84%
We are influenced by
the fields of the Earth.

01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic fields,
the solar fields.

01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:36.980 align:middle line:84%
We know on a full moon,
sometimes strange things happen

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:39.042 align:middle line:84%
to people-- emergency
hospital room visits--

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Increase.

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --traffic accidents
increase, all those things.

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the
fields influence us.

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
The new data now is that we
influence the fields around us.

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-way conversation.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.700 align:middle line:84%
If we create the right
feeling in our heart,

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that is the language that
influences the field.

01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And it took the tragedy
of September 11, 2001

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.040 align:middle line:90%
to tell us that.

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share
this with our viewers.

01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever seen these images
before, what you're seeing,

01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
there are two satellites
over the Northern Hemisphere

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.330 align:middle line:90%
of North America.

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Every 30 minutes, they send
back a signal telling us

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:14.630 align:middle line:84%
how strong the magnetic fields
of the Earth really are.

01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:17.720 align:middle line:84%
One's in red, one's in
blue on your screen.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.215 align:middle line:90%
Each square is a 24-hour day.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
We have the ebb and the
flow, the ebb and the flow.

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
One day, scientists
saw a big spike

01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:25.942 align:middle line:84%
that I'm highlighting
in red right here.

01:15:25.942 --> 01:15:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what on earth?

01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:29.840 align:middle line:84%
What on earth is
causing this spike?

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.930 align:middle line:84%
They went back and overlaid the
data, Lisa, on the map of time.

01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is
that spike began 9:00 AM

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
on September 11,
2001-- 15 minutes

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.151 align:middle line:84%
after the first plane hit the
first tower of the World Trade

01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Center.

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:44.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Before.

01:15:44.275 --> 01:15:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: The thinking is this.

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.170 align:middle line:84%
That it took about 15
minutes for the media

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
to carry the images of that
tragedy around the world.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And that that spike is the
result of millions or perhaps

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
billions of people in the
world simultaneously reacting,

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.241 align:middle line:84%
heart-based emotions responding
to what they're seeing.

01:16:03.241 --> 01:16:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were anger.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Some were shock.

01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Some were disbelief.

01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Some were sadness.

01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:11.550 align:middle line:84%
But they were heart-based
emotions simultaneously

01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
coupling with the
fields of the Earth that

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.959 align:middle line:84%
were being measured by the
satellite 23,000 miles.

01:16:16.959 --> 01:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The satellite
measured these.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So these are
two satellites measuring

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:26.745 align:middle line:84%
precisely the Earth's magnetic
field every 30 minutes,

01:16:26.745 --> 01:16:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and seeing the spike.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
This was the tip-off
to scientists

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that we're connected
to these fields in ways

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that we're only
beginning to understand.

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.020 align:middle line:84%
That tip-off led the
Institute of HeartMath,

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
the pioneering
research organization

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in Northern
California, that I know

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.060 align:middle line:84%
you will have in this
seat in a future program

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.840 align:middle line:84%
to take us even
further than I'm going

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:46.740 align:middle line:90%
to be able to take it right now.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so great.

01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Howard Martin's
going to be here.

01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Howard Martin.

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:50.240 align:middle line:84%
He's a dear friend
and colleague.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.395 align:middle line:84%
We've traveled and toured
together many, many places.

01:16:53.395 --> 01:16:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very honored to be
sharing this project with him.

01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect, yes.

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The
Institute of HeartMath

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:01.820 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first-- the
first, actually-- science-based

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:04.600 align:middle line:84%
organization,
science-based initiative,

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
to take the information
that 2011-- September 11

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.580 align:middle line:84%
taught us, that we
communicate with this field.

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They created this
hypothesis that

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:19.190 align:middle line:84%
strong, collective human emotion
has this measurable impact

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:21.941 align:middle line:84%
on the very field of the Earth
that connects and sustains

01:17:21.941 --> 01:17:22.440 align:middle line:90%
all life.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.037 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, there is no
them and us when

01:17:24.037 --> 01:17:25.870 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the magnetic
field of the Earth.

01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Every blade of grass, every
hamster, every goldfish,

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.210 align:middle line:84%
every CEO of every corporation,
every leader of every nation

01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:33.320 align:middle line:90%
is part of this field.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And people say, what can we
do to tip the scales of peace

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:39.940 align:middle line:90%
and cooperation in our favor?

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:42.685 align:middle line:84%
What we can do is we can
learn to feed, and nourish,

01:17:42.685 --> 01:17:43.644 align:middle line:90%
and nurture this field.

01:17:43.644 --> 01:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
from your living room.

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:46.770 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do it right now.

01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:48.040 align:middle line:90%
This is precisely.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is what
the oneness concept is.

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.600 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking
about all being one,

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.095 align:middle line:84%
this is encapsulated in
the geomagnetic field.

01:17:55.095 --> 01:17:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And the-- it all boils
down to an experience

01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.410 align:middle line:90%
that's called coherence.

01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
If you like to see numbers,
this is precisely what

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:03.020 align:middle line:90%
this is all about.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Every moment of
every day, there's

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:06.860 align:middle line:84%
a signal between your
heart and your brain.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
When that signal is optimum,
it is called optimum coherence.

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It's very low
frequency-- 0.10 Hertz.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
This is where healing
begins in our bodies.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Powerfully enhanced
immune systems.

01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Anti-aging hormones
kick in and make

01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
us look vital and
young like we do today.

01:18:23.190 --> 01:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is that
field in action, yes.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And it extends
beyond our bodies.

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
The effect extends
beyond our bodies.

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
This is what allows
us to couple--

01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to literally couple with these
very powerful magnetic fields

01:18:35.050 --> 01:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
that surround the Earth
and sustain all life.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.600 align:middle line:84%
To the degree that we can
feel the feelings that

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.140 align:middle line:84%
create coherence,
we are communicating

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:44.300 align:middle line:90%
with this larger field.

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:47.600 align:middle line:84%
As we saw in 9/11, it was--
happened spontaneously.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
The question is can
we do it intentionally

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
when we want to rather than
having a tragedy kick us

01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:56.390 align:middle line:90%
into the coherence experience.

01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let me just
get this straight.

01:18:58.030 --> 01:18:59.655 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I want
to go through this

01:18:59.655 --> 01:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
so that we could learn
what the frequency is

01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:03.330 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our bodies.

01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:06.104 align:middle line:84%
And then what the frequency is,
how that relates to the Earth.

01:19:06.104 --> 01:19:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to do an
experiential exercise that's

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
going to tie all
of this together.

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do
that when we come back.

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.940 align:middle line:84%
We'll be right back
with Gregg Braden.

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:17.360 align:middle line:90%


01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:18.694 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

01:19:18.694 --> 01:19:19.735 align:middle line:90%
And this is Gregg Braden.

01:19:19.735 --> 01:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the middle of
an in depth conversation.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.340 align:middle line:84%
We're debunking some
of the false beliefs

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and false assumptions
about the survival

01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:31.660 align:middle line:84%
of the strongest,
survival of the fittest.

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving into the
conversation about coherence.

01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:39.060 align:middle line:90%
About a heart-based society.

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
About a world that
operates in resonance

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:45.397 align:middle line:84%
and in the same frequency
as our heart and our mind.

01:19:45.397 --> 01:19:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's continue on
with this conversation.

01:19:47.230 --> 01:19:48.104 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure, Lisa.

01:19:48.104 --> 01:19:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Just before the break,
we identified the fact

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that the human heart is
the strongest generator

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.484 align:middle line:84%
of electrical and magnetic
fields in the human body.

01:19:57.484 --> 01:19:58.900 align:middle line:84%
It's much stronger
than the brain.

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It's 100 times stronger
than the brain electrically.

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:05.135 align:middle line:84%
5,000 times stronger than
the brain magnetically.

01:20:05.135 --> 01:20:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The heart is.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:06.405 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: The heart is.

01:20:06.405 --> 01:20:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The heart is.

01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:08.881 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That's
important to us because we

01:20:08.881 --> 01:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
know that this magnetic field
that was measured on September

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
11 that we just
saw in the graphs,

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
that that field
is directly linked

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
to the human hearts of
every person on this planet.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And what the spike in
the graph showed us,

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously, the
spontaneous outpouring

01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
of millions, or maybe billions,
of people in response to 9/11

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
showed that we have the
ability to actually strengthen

01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:38.090 align:middle line:90%
that magnetic field.

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:40.000 align:middle line:90%
We saw the big spike.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember a couple
days right after 9/11,

01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:45.020 align:middle line:90%
how coherent this world was?

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
How everyone felt like-- it felt
like there was a family here.

01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:50.747 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it did.

01:20:50.747 --> 01:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
At least in the US, because
that was my experience here.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I was in
Australia over 9/11.

01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:58.365 align:middle line:84%
And recently, not
long after that

01:20:58.365 --> 01:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
in other parts of
the world, there

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
was for me an
unprecedented feeling

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:04.260 align:middle line:90%
of family on our planet.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
That is a beautiful
example of coherence

01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and what coherence can do.

01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There was.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:08.780 align:middle line:90%
There was.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
actions that happened

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
after that they
weren't so coherent.

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Then we
left our coherence.

01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:15.240 align:middle line:90%
We went out of coherence.

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:17.890 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:18.860 align:middle line:90%
So the frequency.

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So this outpouring
of-- it didn't even

01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:25.746 align:middle line:84%
have an emotion
attached to it it.

01:21:25.746 --> 01:21:27.030 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't happy.

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.781 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't sad.

01:21:27.781 --> 01:21:28.405 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't love.

01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:29.570 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't fear.

01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:32.470 align:middle line:84%
It was just a frequency
that increased

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:34.771 align:middle line:90%
in the Earth's resonance.

01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: An honest
way to identify this--

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, help me with this.

01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --is there were
many emotions attached.

01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:44.705 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was many
people witnessed these events

01:21:44.705 --> 01:21:45.455 align:middle line:90%
through the media.

01:21:45.455 --> 01:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It took about 15
minutes for the media

01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:48.160 align:middle line:90%
to carry it around the world.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.065 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's how
powerful the media is.

01:21:49.065 --> 01:21:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I say, I was
in Australia during the time

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and I saw it almost
instantaneously.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Everyone had a
heart-based emotion

01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
that responded to
what they were seeing.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was spontaneous.

01:22:02.890 --> 01:22:03.800 align:middle line:90%
This is the key.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.740 align:middle line:90%
It was spontaneous.

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't so much
a mental training.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It was a spontaneous
outpouring in response.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh my god, or the sadness,
or the hurt, or the anger,

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:15.670 align:middle line:90%
or the confusion.

01:22:15.670 --> 01:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
But the key is it was
based in the human heart.

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was this spontaneous
and collective outpouring

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:27.050 align:middle line:84%
of millions of human hearts,
the magnetic field of millions

01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%
of human hearts in the
same window of time

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing the
result of on this graph.

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.975 align:middle line:90%
The satellites 22,000 miles.

01:22:33.975 --> 01:22:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Picked it up.

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I believe
I said 23 before.

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:40.020 align:middle line:84%
They're 22,000 miles above
the surface of the Earth.

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The field was so--
strengthened so much

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that those satellites
picked up that change.

01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And it told scientists--

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.570 align:middle line:90%
This is the key.

01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It told scientists
for the first time

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're not separate
from the Earth.

01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It gives new meaning
to the Gaia concept,

01:22:56.190 --> 01:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of
a living organism.

01:22:58.610 --> 01:22:59.890 align:middle line:90%
That we are not separate from.

01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:01.420 align:middle line:90%
That we are part of the Earth.

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
We typically go
around our daily lives

01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
not really thinking
much about it,

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and not creating spontaneous,
heart-based emotions.

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:13.690 align:middle line:84%
This event tipped off
the scientific community

01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:15.550 align:middle line:90%
that it is possible.

01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And that spike happened as
the result of a tragedy.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:23.060 align:middle line:84%
The question that the Insitute
of HeartMath and others

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:26.360 align:middle line:84%
began to ask, is
it possible for us

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.440 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen this
magnetic field of the Earth

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.650 align:middle line:90%
without having the tragedy?

01:23:30.650 --> 01:23:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Can we do it because
we choose to,

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.270 align:middle line:84%
because we have
the wisdom to know

01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
how to move into our
heart, how to create

01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:38.440 align:middle line:90%
that experience in our heart?

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.280 align:middle line:90%
So you asked--

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is that
being measured today?

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And people might ask, well,
why would you do that?

01:23:43.050 --> 01:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
tell a quick story.

01:23:44.050 --> 01:23:45.035 align:middle line:90%
It gives a beautiful example.

01:23:45.035 --> 01:23:46.286 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
might clarify this.

01:23:46.286 --> 01:23:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK if I do?

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:47.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please.

01:23:47.725 --> 01:23:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Not long after
September 11, I was in France.

01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:56.011 align:middle line:84%
And I was with a seminar,
about 3,500 people in a room.

01:23:56.011 --> 01:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And there was a man
in the audience.

01:23:57.510 --> 01:24:00.280 align:middle line:84%
He became very, very
angry about something.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Security immediately
escorted him out

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:03.889 align:middle line:84%
and they were going
to make him leave.

01:24:03.889 --> 01:24:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there
are no accidents.

01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, please, just ask the man
to wait outside in the hallway.

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:11.930 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do something.

01:24:11.930 --> 01:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I invited our
room of 3,500 people to do

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.359 align:middle line:84%
was to create a field of
coherence in that room

01:24:19.359 --> 01:24:21.900 align:middle line:84%
just like we're going to do here
in just a couple of minutes.

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you
to follow Lisa and I as we

01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.180 align:middle line:90%
go through a coherent exercise.

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do that
exercise in here,

01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:29.520 align:middle line:90%
just like we did in the room.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So for about three
minutes, we created

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.590 align:middle line:90%
this field of coherence.

01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Then I asked security to bring
the man back into the room.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:35.940 align:middle line:90%
He came back.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:37.760 align:middle line:84%
We gave him a microphone
and a translator

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because my French
is not so good.

01:24:40.210 --> 01:24:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, please, tell me
what you're experiencing.

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa, it was
the strangest thing.

01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:47.470 align:middle line:84%
This man, he was
a very angry man.

01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:51.279 align:middle line:84%
He came and he had this
strange look on his face.

01:24:51.279 --> 01:24:52.695 align:middle line:84%
And I said through
the translator,

01:24:52.695 --> 01:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, can you tell me
what you're experiencing.

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:58.190 align:middle line:90%
He said, it is very strange.

01:24:58.190 --> 01:25:00.290 align:middle line:90%
That's my French accent.

01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, in my mind, I can think
of the reasons why I'm angry,

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
he says, but I can't
feel the anger.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.335 align:middle line:84%
He says, I can't feel
the anger in here.

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
After you did this experience
that we're about to do.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: He walked in--
we've all had this experience.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.234 align:middle line:84%
You're driving to church
on a Sunday morning.

01:25:13.234 --> 01:25:15.092 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
oldies on the radio.

01:25:15.092 --> 01:25:17.300 align:middle line:84%
You walk into church, there's
a whole different vibe.

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole different,
whole different coherence

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.020 align:middle line:90%
that's in there.

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And you immediately, you
kind of meld into that vibe.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is the key.

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:31.910 align:middle line:84%
The man could think of
the reasons to be angry.

01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:33.630 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't feel the anger.

01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
What happened in that
room in France in that day

01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
is possible for a planet
at a time of crisis.

01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
hard for a leader

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
to declare war on
their neighbor when

01:25:43.650 --> 01:25:45.030 align:middle line:90%
they're not feeling that anger.

01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very hard
for nations that

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
have a common economic
interest to fight

01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
one another over that interest
if they are not feeling it.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The flipside of this is
it feeds and nurtures

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of
cooperation and peace.

01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
We all have the opportunity
to nourish and feed

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
this field that encapsulates
the Earth by choosing

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the language from our heart
that we share with that field.

01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:16.830 align:middle line:84%
When the language is optimum,
we call that language coherence,

01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:18.050 align:middle line:90%
optimum coherence.

01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a very low frequency
signal, 0.10 Hertz.

01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:24.832 align:middle line:84%
This is the language that
whales use in the ocean.

01:26:24.832 --> 01:26:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is why
this is so important.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
this is all about

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we-- This is so
very empowering, that we

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:36.710 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, as
people of our planet,

01:26:36.710 --> 01:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
can not only affect the entire
frequency of this planet,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.030 align:middle line:84%
but think of what we can
do in our own families,

01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:47.140 align:middle line:90%
in our own lives.

01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And how we can change
situations in the moment.

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.421 align:middle line:90%
How powerful we really are.

01:26:53.421 --> 01:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, what
I'd like to emphasize

01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
is for people that are hearing
this for the first time,

01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:00.302 align:middle line:90%
this is not about manipulation.

01:27:00.302 --> 01:27:01.093 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please, no.

01:27:01.093 --> 01:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's
not about control.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It is about recognizing that
we are part of this Earth

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.120 align:middle line:90%
rather than separate from it.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And that there's a
field, a magnetic field,

01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that connects and sustains
all life that we're a part of.

01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And that we were born with
an organ in our bodies

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.480 align:middle line:84%
that apparently is designed
to communicate precisely

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.250 align:middle line:90%
with that field.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:21.445 align:middle line:84%
Not through words, but
through the quality

01:27:21.445 --> 01:27:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of emotion because
our hearts are

01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the strongest magnetic
field in our bodies.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
If we're choosing to
communicate with this field,

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to tip the scales of
peace in our favor,

01:27:31.810 --> 01:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
to create an aura of
cooperation and mutual aid.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Or for our own bodies,
coherence is very, very healing

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:41.410 align:middle line:90%
for our bodies.

01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It's where our immune
systems become much stronger.

01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:48.092 align:middle line:84%
Where the stress
hormones begin to-- We

01:27:48.092 --> 01:27:49.800 align:middle line:84%
have less stress
hormones, like cortisol,

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.590 align:middle line:84%
for example, in the
presence of coherence.

01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Our anti-aging hormones,
as we mentioned earlier,

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
kick in in the presence
of this kind of coherence.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So coherence is a very,
very low frequency signal

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.370 align:middle line:90%
that's generated in the heart.

01:28:03.370 --> 01:28:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And this, for me,
is just fascinating

01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:08.650 align:middle line:84%
because this is where the
wisdom of our indigenous

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
ancestors of over 5,000 years
meets the science of today.

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Science is telling
us our heart is

01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:17.020 align:middle line:84%
this powerful, magnetic,
biomagnetic, bioelectrical

01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:17.520 align:middle line:90%
generator.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Science is saying that?

01:28:18.970 --> 01:28:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is
what we're seeing.

01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
the through line,

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
what brings all of the diverse
traditions of spiritual,

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and religious, and indigenous
traditions together,

01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:31.509 align:middle line:84%
almost universally
what you'll find

01:28:31.509 --> 01:28:33.300 align:middle line:84%
is they're all asking
us one way or another

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
to move into our hearts.

01:28:34.630 --> 01:28:35.727 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:37.060 align:middle line:90%
And everyone learns differently.

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty of having
so many different traditions.

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:43.687 align:middle line:84%
Everyone learns differently,
so everyone can relate to one

01:28:43.687 --> 01:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
or-- you might not
relate to all them,

01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:46.850 align:middle line:84%
but they'll relate
to one or the other.

01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't
relate to science,

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.015 align:middle line:84%
but they relate to the
indigenous traditions.

01:28:50.015 --> 01:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Some people reject that, but
they relate to the science.

01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It's all bringing us back to
our hearts, Lisa, at the time--

01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:58.831 align:middle line:84%
this is the context--- at
the time when our planet,

01:28:58.831 --> 01:29:00.455 align:middle line:84%
and our lives, and
our civilization are

01:29:00.455 --> 01:29:02.979 align:middle line:84%
at the greatest crises of 5,000
years of recorded history.

01:29:02.979 --> 01:29:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Needs it the most, yes.

01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think
it's no accident

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.680 align:middle line:90%
that it's happening that way.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And so there's other
words for heart.

01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:10.950 align:middle line:84%
If you don't resonate with
that word, it could be family.

01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:12.570 align:middle line:90%
It could be gratitude.

01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:13.620 align:middle line:90%
It could be caring.

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.150 align:middle line:90%
It could be compassion.

01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:16.270 align:middle line:90%
It could be service.

01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.895 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

01:29:16.895 --> 01:29:19.370 align:middle line:84%
What scientists have found
in the English language

01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:22.920 align:middle line:84%
in the West, a few very
precise words actually

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.240 align:middle line:84%
create this experience
in our bodies.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And they are the words of
appreciation, gratitude, care,

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.940 align:middle line:90%
compassion, for example.

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Those words trigger this
heart-based experience

01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:36.690 align:middle line:90%
of coherence.

01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And then that language
between our heart

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and our brain, that's
when it's optimum.

01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do, I'd just like

01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to share-- we've now taken
this one step further.

01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:47.519 align:middle line:84%
And I say we because I'm
working with the institute

01:29:47.519 --> 01:29:48.060 align:middle line:90%
of HeartMath.

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not their employee.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm closely aligned
with them because we

01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:53.940 align:middle line:84%
have a common
passion to contribute

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.250 align:middle line:84%
in every way we can
at this critical time,

01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:57.989 align:middle line:84%
this pivotal, precious,
precious moment.

01:29:57.989 --> 01:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
beautiful right there.

01:29:59.530 --> 01:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
That's coherence in
action right there.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: In the
history of our world,

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.930 align:middle line:84%
we have this rare
opportunity, when

01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
it looks like things
are falling apart,

01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild from a place
that's sustainable,

01:30:13.670 --> 01:30:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that is coherent,
that is compassionate.

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.420 align:middle line:90%
And we're doing it right now.

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Institute of
HeartMath created

01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:24.920 align:middle line:84%
the first science-based
initiative

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:29.285 align:middle line:84%
to now use this scientifically
proven relationship

01:30:29.285 --> 01:30:31.790 align:middle line:84%
that we have to the
Earth to do just this.

01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:35.890 align:middle line:84%
To tip these scales of
peace and life in our favor.

01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The first science-based
initiative.

01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:38.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not a byproduct.

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
What I'm about to share
with you is the reason

01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that this organization
was created.

01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The Institute of
HeartMath created

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.610 align:middle line:84%
what is called the Global
Coherence Initiative.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.435 align:middle line:84%
Personal coherence is
good for our bodies.

01:30:50.435 --> 01:30:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Global coherence is
good for the world.

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:54.351 align:middle line:84%
On your screen, I'm going to
share with you the mission

01:30:54.351 --> 01:30:54.880 align:middle line:90%
statement.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.760 align:middle line:90%
This is the stated mission.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:59.740 align:middle line:84%
It is "to unite
millions of people

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:03.760 align:middle line:84%
from varied beliefs and
cultures to shift consciousness

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:07.500 align:middle line:84%
from instability and chaos
to balance and cooperation."

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.030 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason
this technology

01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
is being implemented
the way it is today.

01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: An enormous amount.

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Never has
this been done before.

01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Never has been attempted before.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So the Global
Coherence Initiative

01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:20.420 align:middle line:90%
is a two-phase initiative.

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:25.830 align:middle line:84%
The first phase is building
a very unique kind of sensor

01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to listen in to these
magnetic fields of the Earth

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about our
relationship to these fields

01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
so that we know
when we're having

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.220 align:middle line:90%
a positive effect on the fields.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Now here's why
this is important.

01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Always in the past,
Lisa, it's been

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:42.190 align:middle line:84%
a spin-off or a byproduct
of a weather satellite,

01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:45.320 align:middle line:84%
or a military satellite, or
a communication satellite.

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:48.710 align:middle line:84%
This is an independently
funded and created

01:31:48.710 --> 01:31:51.160 align:middle line:84%
project, privately
funded and created,

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.590 align:middle line:84%
specifically to help us
understand our relationship

01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:55.700 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth and know when
we're being effective.

01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.040 align:middle line:90%
So the first phase.

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:00.270 align:middle line:84%
If you'll look on your screen,
I want to share with you.

01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:02.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a technical-looking
blueprint of one

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.120 align:middle line:90%
of these sensors looks like.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.880 align:middle line:84%
They are installed
into the ground.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.346 align:middle line:84%
And the next image
is how beautiful

01:32:09.346 --> 01:32:10.720 align:middle line:84%
these sensors can
be when they're

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.190 align:middle line:90%
installed into the earth.

01:32:12.190 --> 01:32:13.430 align:middle line:90%
This is the first sensor.

01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
the actual sensor.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:15.836 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That is
actually located

01:32:15.836 --> 01:32:19.520 align:middle line:84%
in Boulder Creek, California
at the Institute of HeartMath

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:22.980 align:middle line:84%
headquarters,
that's now measuring

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:26.900 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic fields of the
Earth in ways that are unique,

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.440 align:middle line:90%
and telling us information.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.360 align:middle line:84%
We're learning things
that we've never

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.420 align:middle line:84%
known before about our
relationship to the Earth.

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Every day, this-- Well,
this is the first sensor.

01:32:35.490 --> 01:32:38.112 align:middle line:84%
Now there are other sensors that
are sending back-- every day,

01:32:38.112 --> 01:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
they're sending back data
that looks like this.

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:41.444 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing
on your screen

01:32:41.444 --> 01:32:45.255 align:middle line:84%
is a 24-hour section of data
from the left to the right.

01:32:45.255 --> 01:32:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Where you see the
bright areas is

01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:48.504 align:middle line:84%
where humans are most
active, in the daytime.

01:32:48.504 --> 01:32:51.540 align:middle line:84%
At night, it's where
there's less activity.

01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And the striations
that you're seeing,

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.330 align:middle line:84%
these are levels of
frequency that you've

01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:56.590 align:middle line:90%
been asking me about.

01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:57.935 align:middle line:90%
The earth-resonant frequencies.

01:32:57.935 --> 01:32:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The earth-resonant
frequencies.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That you're
actually seeing here.

01:33:01.530 --> 01:33:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is one
day's worth of data.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:07.570 align:middle line:84%
There, right now, are a
number of different sites

01:33:07.570 --> 01:33:08.660 align:middle line:90%
that are installed.

01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:10.830 align:middle line:84%
There's one in Boulder
Creek, California.

01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:11.510 align:middle line:90%
One in New York.

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:middle line:90%
One in the UK.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.627 align:middle line:90%
There is one now that is in--

01:33:15.627 --> 01:33:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: New Zealand.

01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --is in Saudi Arabia
and one is in New Zealand.

01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:22.380 align:middle line:84%
These sites are
installed and they

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:23.940 align:middle line:84%
are functioning
as it stands now.

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:25.810 align:middle line:84%
The proposed site,
when we're finished,

01:33:25.810 --> 01:33:28.530 align:middle line:84%
we would like to have these
additional sensors to give us

01:33:28.530 --> 01:33:29.270 align:middle line:90%
better data.

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.186 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, because
this is privately funded,

01:33:31.186 --> 01:33:34.150 align:middle line:84%
is there any-- is it
completely neutral in the way

01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that this information
is fed back?

01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no real reason
for it to be biased.

01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It's not biased.

01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:40.916 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll say is that
other organizations are

01:33:40.916 --> 01:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
very interested in the data
that's coming back because it

01:33:43.290 --> 01:33:47.210 align:middle line:84%
is independently-- it's
being created independently.

01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So these are the sites
that are in place.

01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:52.245 align:middle line:84%
This is what we would like
for the sites to look like,

01:33:52.245 --> 01:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
or the network to look like
when the sites are finished.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.230 align:middle line:84%
That's phase one, is
designing the network

01:33:57.230 --> 01:33:59.510 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about our
relationship to the Earth.

01:33:59.510 --> 01:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Phase two is what
we're here about today,

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.089 align:middle line:84%
is learning the
experience of coherence.

01:34:05.089 --> 01:34:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And for many people, it's
very intuitive, almost second

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.020 align:middle line:90%
nature.

01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.519 align:middle line:84%
For other people,
they say wow, this

01:34:09.519 --> 01:34:11.310 align:middle line:84%
is unlike anything
I've ever done before.

01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:14.729 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like to emphasize
is that this is not a religion.

01:34:14.729 --> 01:34:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's nondenominational.

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It is
nondenominational.

01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to replace any
practice that anyone is already

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:21.250 align:middle line:90%
doing.

01:34:21.250 --> 01:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
However, it helps us
to move into our hearts

01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:26.080 align:middle line:84%
while we're doing whatever
practice we're drawn to do.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:28.909 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, I think
it has tremendous appeal.

01:34:28.909 --> 01:34:30.992 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It will only add
to whatever you're doing.

01:34:30.992 --> 01:34:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: A universal appeal.

01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:33.830 align:middle line:90%
So is this a good time, Lisa?

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:36.830 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do is
lead our listeners maybe

01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:37.980 align:middle line:90%
through this experience.

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there are members of
the Global Coherence Initiative

01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:43.750 align:middle line:90%
in 86 different countries.

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing the countries
on your screen right now.

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so great.

01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:47.566 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
worldwide initiative.

01:34:47.566 --> 01:34:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Who are working at
different times of the day

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:51.730 align:middle line:90%
and night.

01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:55.350 align:middle line:84%
At some time, every 24-hour
day, someone out there

01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:58.420 align:middle line:84%
is feeding this coherence
into the fields of the earth.

01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to have as many
people do this and the highest

01:35:02.210 --> 01:35:05.100 align:middle line:84%
quality of coherence
as is possible.

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So these are people that
are trained to do this.

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:09.880 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to know more
about the Global Coherence

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Initiative, I invite you
to go to glcoherence.org.

01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:14.930 align:middle line:90%
It's on your screen right now.

01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
All the technical
papers are there.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.479 align:middle line:90%
All the sensor sites are there.

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And what we're about to
do next is there as well.

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.770 align:middle line:90%
You have a question?

01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:26.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the opportunity
now is to feel and to make

01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:30.690 align:middle line:84%
an impact on this planet in
some way right now, right here,

01:35:30.690 --> 01:35:31.590 align:middle line:90%
watching this.

01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:32.506 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: This moment.

01:35:32.506 --> 01:35:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have this moment
right now to make an impact.

01:35:35.010 --> 01:35:36.290 align:middle line:90%
You have this moment.

01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
what the science is

01:35:37.810 --> 01:35:39.710 align:middle line:84%
telling us very clearly,
every moment of every day,

01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:40.980 align:middle line:90%
we're all feeding this field.

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.750 align:middle line:84%
The question is what
are we feeding it.

01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:44.840 align:middle line:84%
If we're feeding
it a lot of fear

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:49.180 align:middle line:84%
from the images of something
bad happening in 2012,

01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:53.220 align:middle line:84%
from the anger of what's
happening on Wall Street,

01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.650 align:middle line:84%
from the anger of
what's happening

01:35:54.650 --> 01:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
in the global economic meltdown,
we know what that kind of fear

01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:01.940 align:middle line:90%
creates in the field.

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:04.460 align:middle line:90%
It's an incoherent experience.

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:07.400 align:middle line:84%
We have the opportunity
now from our living rooms--

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.720 align:middle line:84%
this is the beauty, Lisa,
because every one of us

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:12.440 align:middle line:84%
has a vote in terms
of what kind of energy

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.180 align:middle line:90%
we feed into this field.

01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And we all collectively
benefit on a large scale

01:36:18.090 --> 01:36:20.520 align:middle line:84%
from what relatively
few people choose

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.070 align:middle line:90%
to contribute on a small scale.

01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, very true.

01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And living in fear is something
that we are constantly

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.600 align:middle line:84%
fed through many sources, and
in the media and so forth.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:34.695 align:middle line:84%
And this is the opportunity to
have a vacation from that fear.

01:36:34.695 --> 01:36:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:37.145 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
invite our listeners

01:36:37.145 --> 01:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to think back to
that French man.

01:36:40.690 --> 01:36:44.210 align:middle line:84%
In the room, he could
not feel the anger

01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
in the presence
of that coherence.

01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like to do--
something you'd like to say,

01:36:48.710 --> 01:36:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd like to
invite our listeners.

01:36:50.670 --> 01:36:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's feed the fields of
our Mother Earth right now.

01:36:54.930 --> 01:36:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's feed from our hearts.

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And I will invite
you to follow me

01:36:57.930 --> 01:36:59.305 align:middle line:84%
through the steps of
creating coherence.

01:36:59.305 --> 01:37:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And you had something
that you wanted to--

01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:01.376 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:37:01.376 --> 01:37:01.876 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:37:01.876 --> 01:37:04.720 align:middle line:84%
I actually caught myself
because this is your opportunity

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to take a vacation from
fear, but this is also

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.722 align:middle line:90%
your opportunity to stay.

01:37:08.722 --> 01:37:09.513 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Redefine.

01:37:09.513 --> 01:37:10.260 align:middle line:90%
We redefine.

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.860 align:middle line:84%
To stay in that place of
coherence and see how it feels.

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:18.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I found in my time

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.510 align:middle line:84%
with the traditional
and indigenous people

01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:22.670 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world is they
have the same problems moving

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:24.378 align:middle line:84%
into their hearts that
we do in the West.

01:37:24.378 --> 01:37:26.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not automatic, apparently.

01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And for many people,
one of the first things

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that happens when I ask them
to move into their hearts

01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:35.572 align:middle line:84%
is they think about
what it would be like

01:37:35.572 --> 01:37:37.530 align:middle line:84%
if they were in their
hearts, but they're still

01:37:37.530 --> 01:37:38.113 align:middle line:90%
in their mind.

01:37:38.113 --> 01:37:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So here is what many
indigenous traditions do,

01:37:40.450 --> 01:37:43.710 align:middle line:84%
is they simply touch
their heart center.

01:37:43.710 --> 01:37:46.480 align:middle line:84%
In this way, some people
in the Buddhist traditions,

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.050 align:middle line:84%
they'll do it like this, but we
don't have to do it that way.

01:37:49.050 --> 01:37:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The physical sensation of
touching our heart center

01:37:51.970 --> 01:37:53.820 align:middle line:84%
automatically draws
your awareness

01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:56.410 align:middle line:84%
from your mind to the place
where you feel the sensation.

01:37:56.410 --> 01:37:59.092 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're often
asked not to cross our legs

01:37:59.092 --> 01:38:01.300 align:middle line:84%
when we do this because
that's another sensation that

01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:03.010 align:middle line:90%
would draw our attention.

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So there are three steps
to creating coherence.

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go through
them, and then we'll

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.800 align:middle line:90%
have this experience together.

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The first is moving
into our hearts.

01:38:12.730 --> 01:38:14.920 align:middle line:84%
The second is to
best of our ability

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.190 align:middle line:84%
feeling the feelings that create
coherence-- appreciation, care,

01:38:18.190 --> 01:38:19.700 align:middle line:90%
gratitude, compassion.

01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:22.930 align:middle line:84%
The third is breathing
from that space.

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'd like
to invite you to do

01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:27.730 align:middle line:84%
is so that you know that you
are part of a community that's

01:38:27.730 --> 01:38:29.330 align:middle line:90%
doing this right now.

01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:31.670 align:middle line:84%
The next image that
comes up on your screen

01:38:31.670 --> 01:38:33.980 align:middle line:84%
is also from the Global
Coherence Initiative.

01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:36.870 align:middle line:90%
It is the image of Earth.

01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And you should be seeing that
image on your screen right now.

01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:42.696 align:middle line:84%
The image of Earth
with some little lights

01:38:42.696 --> 01:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
at different places
on the Earth.

01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Every place you see
one of those lights,

01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:49.680 align:middle line:84%
right now there are 21 people
throughout the Earth who

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.140 align:middle line:84%
are logged on through the
Global Coherence site who

01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:56.780 align:middle line:84%
are creating coherence,
and feeding and nourishing

01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:59.230 align:middle line:84%
that coherence into
the field right now.

01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:00.930 align:middle line:90%
21 computers are logged on.

01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:02.800 align:middle line:84%
However, I know
some of these sites.

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:05.651 align:middle line:84%
At each computer, there can be
hundreds of people in a room.

01:39:05.651 --> 01:39:07.400 align:middle line:84%
They have done this
in Japan, for example.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.650 align:middle line:84%
300 or 400 people in a
room with one computer.

01:39:09.650 --> 01:39:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you of
course can do it

01:39:10.730 --> 01:39:11.590 align:middle line:84%
without being on
the computer, yeah.

01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: You can do this.

01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:13.842 align:middle line:84%
You can go on when we
finish this program.

01:39:13.842 --> 01:39:15.300 align:middle line:84%
You can go on and
do this yourself.

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:16.633 align:middle line:90%
I'm inviting you to join us now.

01:39:16.633 --> 01:39:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of
this is it gives us

01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:19.840 align:middle line:90%
a real sense of community.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Real time, these
humans, your family,

01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:25.270 align:middle line:84%
your brothers and sisters,
my brothers and sisters.

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:27.849 align:middle line:84%
And here we are in
Boulder, Colorado.

01:39:27.849 --> 01:39:29.640 align:middle line:84%
We should see ourselves
on there right now.

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.270 align:middle line:84%
We are out doing
precisely the same thing.

01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So you should begin to
hear a little music coming

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.820 align:middle line:90%
through your speakers now.

01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:41.732 align:middle line:84%
And that music is just
to shift the energy

01:39:41.732 --> 01:39:43.190 align:middle line:84%
a little bit from
what we're doing.

01:39:43.190 --> 01:39:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Music is the window
into the soul anyway.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.158 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It really is.

01:39:46.158 --> 01:39:49.135 align:middle line:84%
So I'll invite you
to uncross your legs.

01:39:49.135 --> 01:39:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe take a
couple of deep breaths.

01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:53.835 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through
a lot of data,

01:39:53.835 --> 01:39:55.285 align:middle line:90%
a lot of left brain information.

01:39:55.285 --> 01:39:57.105 align:middle line:90%
We're going to shift gears.

01:39:57.105 --> 01:39:58.227 align:middle line:90%
A couple of deep breaths.

01:39:58.227 --> 01:40:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to invite
you to move your awareness

01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:01.860 align:middle line:90%
from your mind into your hearts.

01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Simply touch your heart
center, if you will.

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:07.020 align:middle line:90%
If it feels appropriate.

01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into that space.

01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:13.390 align:middle line:90%


01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
active experience.

01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:19.315 align:middle line:84%
It's not about drifting, or
relaxing, or spacing out.

01:40:19.315 --> 01:40:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It is an active focus to keep
your awareness in your heart

01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:24.160 align:middle line:90%
center.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're
there, to the best

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.630 align:middle line:84%
of your ability, if you will
feel what for you are feelings

01:40:29.630 --> 01:40:35.590 align:middle line:84%
of care, appreciation,
gratitude, compassion.

01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:37.161 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And notice
what you feel when

01:40:37.161 --> 01:40:38.702 align:middle line:84%
you feel those
feelings in your body.

01:40:38.702 --> 01:40:42.260 align:middle line:90%
If your body relaxes.

01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:45.320 align:middle line:90%
If your entire mind relaxes.

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Just for a moment.

01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Care,
appreciation, gratitude.

01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:52.859 align:middle line:90%


01:40:52.859 --> 01:40:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Love.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And as you begin
to feel those feelings

01:40:55.590 --> 01:40:59.975 align:middle line:84%
in your heart, if you can
breathe as if your breath are

01:40:59.975 --> 01:41:04.280 align:middle line:84%
coming-- is coming from the
place of that sensation.

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the simplest ways

01:41:08.010 --> 01:41:13.508 align:middle line:84%
to move into a high
stage of coherence.

01:41:13.508 --> 01:41:15.895 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give us
just a few seconds

01:41:15.895 --> 01:41:17.186 align:middle line:90%
to do this together in silence.

01:41:17.186 --> 01:41:33.455 align:middle line:90%


01:41:33.455 --> 01:41:36.413 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am imagining so many
people doing this right now.

01:41:36.413 --> 01:41:39.352 align:middle line:90%
What a beautiful feeling.

01:41:39.352 --> 01:41:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: As you feel
complete with that,

01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:43.438 align:middle line:84%
let's take one more, just
one more deep breath.

01:41:43.438 --> 01:41:45.707 align:middle line:90%


01:41:45.707 --> 01:41:47.790 align:middle line:84%
As if that breath were
coming from the place where

01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:50.950 align:middle line:84%
you feel the sensation
of your heart.

01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:52.915 align:middle line:84%
And if your eyes are
closed, you can gently

01:41:52.915 --> 01:41:54.190 align:middle line:90%
begin to open your eyes.

01:41:54.190 --> 01:41:57.100 align:middle line:90%


01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I wanted
to share this with you

01:41:59.150 --> 01:42:03.080 align:middle line:84%
today is because
coherence is that simple.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are other
techniques that go much deeper.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
another guest, Howard Martin,

01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:10.211 align:middle line:84%
from the Institute of
HeartMath that will take us

01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:11.751 align:middle line:84%
in other techniques
and much deeper.

01:42:11.751 --> 01:42:12.750 align:middle line:90%
But this is the essence.

01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Moving from our heart,
that is the strongest

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:18.230 align:middle line:84%
biomagnetic generator
in the body.

01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:21.635 align:middle line:84%
Creating the communication
between our heart and our brain

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.510 align:middle line:90%
through that feeling.

01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:25.830 align:middle line:84%
When you feel those feelings,
that's what sets up the link.

01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And we do that.

01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:29.790 align:middle line:84%
We couple to this
field of the Earth.

01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:32.650 align:middle line:84%
We're already one, and
we honor that oneness.

01:42:32.650 --> 01:42:35.750 align:middle line:84%
We honor that coupling
to a greater degree.

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, we
nourish and nurture

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the field that connects
and sustains all life.

01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:45.760 align:middle line:84%
This is how we tip the scales
of choice, peace, and balance

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.325 align:middle line:84%
in our favor at a time of
crisis when we most need it.

01:42:48.325 --> 01:42:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The beauty of that,
Gregg, was how simple it was.

01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It is simple.

01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it is so simple.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.100 align:middle line:84%
You can do that when
you're-- even open-eyed.

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:57.500 align:middle line:90%
When you're driving.

01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:58.955 align:middle line:90%
When you're with a child.

01:42:58.955 --> 01:43:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Or if there's a chaotic
situation happening around you,

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:03.770 align:middle line:84%
you can completely
ground yourself that way.

01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: You can.

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're
driving, I want you

01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.710 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the road
in front of you.

01:43:06.710 --> 01:43:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But yeah, you can
drive from a coherent state.

01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, I'm from LA.

01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.100 align:middle line:90%
I sit in traffic a lot.

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So I mean just
the bottom line is

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.390 align:middle line:84%
a chaotic situation
happening at work.

01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:16.520 align:middle line:90%
News coming in.

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Anything that happens that takes
you out of that frequen-- you

01:43:19.330 --> 01:43:22.190 align:middle line:84%
yourself can get back
into that coherence

01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:24.144 align:middle line:84%
and it will affect
the people around you.

01:43:24.144 --> 01:43:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There are
groups of people now

01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:27.604 align:middle line:84%
that come together
on a nightly basis.

01:43:27.604 --> 01:43:29.520 align:middle line:84%
They gather with their
children around the TV,

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:31.935 align:middle line:84%
watch the 6 o'clock news
the way it's reported.

01:43:31.935 --> 01:43:33.290 align:middle line:90%
They turn the news off.

01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:35.960 align:middle line:84%
They redefine what
they have just

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.720 align:middle line:84%
been shown through the
presence of coherence,

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and feed the coherence
back into the fields.

01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And the young people
respond to this

01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:44.680 align:middle line:84%
really well because all
of a sudden, the world

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.180 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's
a world that will

01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:48.417 align:middle line:90%
support them and their choices.

01:43:48.417 --> 01:43:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And that they can contribute
in new and meaningful ways.

01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not a world that is
in-- that is falling apart,

01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that this is the end of
everything meaningful

01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:58.010 align:middle line:90%
as we've ever known it.

01:43:58.010 --> 01:44:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a rare, pivotal
moment of change.

01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:04.550 align:middle line:84%
You and I are living the
shift, the greatest shift,

01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:09.230 align:middle line:84%
in thinking, in power, in wealth
in 5,000 years of recorded

01:44:09.230 --> 01:44:09.830 align:middle line:90%
human history.

01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:14.280 align:middle line:84%
No one told us precisely
how to be to navigate this.

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.445 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning as we
go through our ancestors

01:44:16.445 --> 01:44:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and the best
science of our time.

01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank all
of our listeners

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.728 align:middle line:84%
for all you're doing to
contribute to a better world.

01:44:21.728 --> 01:44:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa, for your programming,
and for giving us a vehicle.

01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And for Gaiam for sharing
the opportunity so that we

01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:30.589 align:middle line:84%
can carry this very
life-affirming message

01:44:30.589 --> 01:44:31.130 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:31.629 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And this very
empowering message.

01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:35.805 align:middle line:84%
