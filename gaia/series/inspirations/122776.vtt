00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaia Inspirations."

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:10%
And our topic for this
series, taped at the Celebrate

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.080 align:middle line:10%
your Life Conference
here in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:10%
is to explore the I am meaning.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I remember Wayne Dyer
once saying to me

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that he was thankful
for those who said no.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Because of them, he was able
to do it himself. [LAUGHING]

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
what I think

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
that my guest today has
done, geologist and computer

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:90%
scientist, Gregg Braden.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
When he said climate
extremes are the new normal,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
he challenged
conventional science.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And now what we're hearing
about in the news every day

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:90%
is about these new normals.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:10%
And Gregg goes into detail
in that with his book

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.317 align:middle line:10%
called, "Resilience from the
Heart," among many other things

00:00:55.317 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:10%
we're going to talk about today.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: It's so
good to be back with you.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been far too long
since we've done this.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.076 align:middle line:84%
And my sense is we are going to
go very quickly through this.

00:01:05.076 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I think our time is going to
pass quickly because there's

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:90%
so many directions.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Each topic could be a whole
conversation unto itself.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
follow your lead.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have been through and I
have followed your work for so

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
long, hearing you talk
about ancient civilizations

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and they were discovered
so much longer than we

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.787 align:middle line:84%
see in our history books, to
now this climate extreme, lets--

00:01:23.787 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I just want to
say something about that.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:10%
Because the best minds of
our time are telling us

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:10%
we live in this
time of extremes.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:10%
It's caught a lot of people
off guard, because of the way

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:10%
we think.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And we've been conditioned
to separate science

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
from spirituality, from
art, from everyday life.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And our ancestors
never did that.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:10%
So what you're seeing
me do in the book

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:10%
and through these
presentations in many ways

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:10%
mirrors an earlier way of
seeing ourselves in relationship

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:10%
to the world and our bodies,
and the capabilities that we

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:10%
have within that perspective.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And also, as you pointed
out that our ancestors also

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
did not believe in a
separation between our bodies

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:90%
and our minds.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:90%
They believed that they are one.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And you personally
used that experience

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
when you healed yourself
of a tumor, which I think

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:90%
is incredible that you did that.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know you talked
about this before,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:84%
but can you just share
that experience with us

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:90%
really quick?

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
huge what you did.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I don't
talk about it a lot.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I
dwell on, but I'll just

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:90%
tell you the story.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s, middle
to late 1990s,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity
to meet a master.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
He was a martial arts
and Qigong master

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
from China, who was
teaching a form of-- this

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
is one of those places
where they didn't separate

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:84%
the healing from the art, from
the life-- so he was teaching

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
this way of being that heals
our bodies very, very quickly.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And there is a film that I was
showing all over the world.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:90%
And it was an amazing film.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:10%
It's a document--
it's on the website,

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:10%
you'll be able to
see that-- of what

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:10%
is called a medicine-less
hospital in Beijing, China,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:10%
where there was a woman who had
an inoperable bladder tumor.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Medical doctors said, we
can't help you with that.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:90%
She said, that's fine.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to an
alternative clinic.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And she went to this place, and
they taught her about her body.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:90%
She didn't go to get fixed.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
They taught her about her
relationship to her body

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and how to change her beliefs,
her diet, her movement,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:90%
her breath, all of these things.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And when it made
sense, they helped

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:90%
her-- facilitated-- the healing.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And on the video, what you see,
in two minutes and 40 seconds--

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
real-time, it's not
time-lapsed-- is,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
you see this tumor, in
place, in the bladder,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:90%
through a sonogram.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And you see it
literally dissolve

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.862 align:middle line:84%
and disappear in the
presence of these techniques.

00:03:50.862 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So I was showing this
all over the world.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I remember seeing it.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.746 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I went through a
physical in the year 2000,

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and my doctor said
to me, Gregg, you've

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
got something
inside your bladder

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:90%
that it shouldn't be there.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.789 align:middle line:90%
We need to operate.

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And surgery was, like,
the last thing on my mind.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.913 align:middle line:90%
I said, give me two weeks.

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:06.905 align:middle line:84%
I said, give me two
weeks to work with this.

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:08.905 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you think
about the synchronicities?

00:04:08.905 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:90%
That you'd been shown this--

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, I did, and
I had to get really clear.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I've
been showing this

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.423 align:middle line:84%
to people all over the world and
audiences all over the world.

00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
We've been watching
this, and in my world,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
we mirror what we
experience in the world.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It happens on very
intimate levels.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not surprised that I
may be developing something

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that I have been so
deeply enmeshed with,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.896 align:middle line:84%
seeing over and over again with
audiences all over the world.

00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, now, this
is my opportunity

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to live in my life what I've
been offering to others,

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and what I learned from my
time with indigenous people

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
in the monasteries of Tibet
and Bolivia and Peru and Egypt,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and through the
indigenous traditions.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So I practiced for
myself, very intently,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:90%
all the things I was sharing.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It's about connecting the
heart and the brain together,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
the neural network of
the heart and the brain,

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:84%
into a single-- two organs--
a single potent network

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that opens the door to
subconscious programming

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And to healing in our
bodies, because it triggers

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
over 1,300 biochemical
reactions just

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
from having this harmonization
between the heart

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It's called coherence,
heart-brain coherence.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:90%
So I did this for myself.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is so
interesting, Lisa--

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
this is how deep the
subconscious goes--

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I practiced everything that I
was sharing with everyone else.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea if it
was working or not.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But even that little
inkling of doubt remained.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the Mayo Clinic
in Jacksonville, Florida,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
in the year 2000, and actually
was prepped for surgery just

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
nothing was there.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
I remember was

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.762 align:middle line:84%
being wheeled into
this room, and then I

00:05:55.762 --> 00:05:56.970 align:middle line:90%
woke up in the recovery room.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor was
standing there.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
He says, why are you here?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.539 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what do you mean?

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't
know why you're.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's
nothing in your bladder.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:90%
There's no scar tissue.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.992 align:middle line:84%
There's no sign
anything ever was there.

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've just done
all this for nothing.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
He says, what do
you think happened?

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.067 align:middle line:84%
I was very groggy
from the anesthetic.

00:06:13.067 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to him about
medicine-less hospitals

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.589 align:middle line:84%
in Beijing and the
heart-mind connection

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
as he turned around and
was walking out the door.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.796 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to hear that.

00:06:20.796 --> 00:06:22.866 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I went into a little
bit of detail with that.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I
think it was important

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
for me was so that I could
look any human in the eye

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.676 align:middle line:84%
and say, I know from
personal experience

00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that what I'm saying to
you has the potential

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:90%
to change your life.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Because it changed mine.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And that's why I
wanted to share it in that way.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
had been after you

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
did your journeys
and your travels

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.058 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, you went
through this experience.

00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
the level of detail.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:90%
That's really powerful.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.356 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, I
just want to emphasize

00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
it was less about making
a tumor go away and more

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
about rebalancing and
recreating a balance in my body.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And in the presence
of that balance,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:84%
there's no room for anything
that doesn't fit that balance.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So I want to just clarify it's
not about judging a condition

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and saying this is
bad, make it go away.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It's about choosing
to find the harmony,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and in the presence of
that harmony, that's

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.450 align:middle line:90%
all that can exist.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.241 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
if I said it that way?

00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's about the balance
and creating that balance,

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
because it creates
neuropeptides.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
It creates, you said,
growth hormones.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of things.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So can
I add on to this?

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Please.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I'm following
your lead here.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.049 align:middle line:84%
You know, when an
author writes a book,

00:07:33.049 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and I think our audience
probably knows-- what makes it

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
into the book is usually
the tip of the iceberg,

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
research underlying

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that that never makes
it onto the pages.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:84%
When I was writing some
of my earlier books,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.534 align:middle line:84%
I was led time and
time again to a study

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that very few people
have ever heard of.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share it
with your listeners.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
important-- it's critical.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
1932, Harvard University
Medical School.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
this is happening.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the researchers,
his name was Bremer,

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
showed his students
a film that he

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
had made where he
documented the blood moving

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.304 align:middle line:90%
through an embryo of a chick.

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
see the blood

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.344 align:middle line:84%
moving through the
embryo of the chick.

00:08:14.344 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
He chose a chick because it's
not attached to its mother,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
so whatever's happening is
not dependent on the mother.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:90%
It's happening in this chick.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.090 align:middle line:90%
So here's the key.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
The blood is moving
through the embryo

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:84%
although the heart
has yet to develop.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:84%
There is no heart
pumping the blood.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:90%
So two questions come up.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
Number one, why is
the blood moving

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:90%
if the heart is not pumping it?

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that is that
fluids in their natural state

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:84%
want to move-- in the ground,
water, and in our bodies,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
blood-- will move
of its own volition

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:84%
through what are called little
micro vortices, little spirals

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:90%
of motion.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:84%
The heart helps, but it will
move without the heart pumping.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So that leads to the
question that Bremer asked.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
If this is happening
without the heart,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
maybe the primary
purpose of the heart

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
is more than simply
pumping blood?

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
What else does our heart do
that we have yet to explore?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And part of the answer to
that was discovered in 1991.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
In 1991, scientists
found in the human heart

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:84%
a collection of a little over
40,000 specialized cells called

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.110 align:middle line:84%
sensory neurites,
which is a very

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:84%
fancy word for brain-like cells,
but they're not in the brain.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They're in the heart, a
neural network in the heart.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And these neurons,
they are so brain-like,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
they can actually
remember independent

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:90%
of the cranial brain.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:84%
They can think independently
of the cranial brain.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
They can feel and
sense independently

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:90%
of the cranial brain.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:90%
So there's one path.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
What is it that our hearts are
capable of that we are only

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Number two, as it
applies to my experience,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:84%
not only can we use
it independently

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
of the cranial brain,
but we can tune our heart

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:84%
to work with our brain, tune
the neural network of our heart

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:90%
to work with our brain.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Two organs, a single
potent neural network.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we learn to
harmonize that network

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to serve us
in the way it was intended,

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
miraculous-appearing
things happen in the body.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Which is precisely what happened
with me in my experience,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%
because I was following the
traditions of our ancestors.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.757 align:middle line:84%
Those who've come before us
who didn't know the science,

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:84%
but they understood
the relationships.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:84%
They didn't use the
words, but they really

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:90%
knew how these things work.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was simply following
the harmonization techniques,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
tuning the heart and
the brain together.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And once that
harmony occurs, it's

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.109 align:middle line:90%
like this signal to your body.

00:10:41.109 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
here's this harmony.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
1400-plus biochemical
reactions are

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
released into the body,
powerful immune response,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.595 align:middle line:84%
anti-aging hormones,
I mean, you name it.

00:10:52.595 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's all about harmony.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's just from tuning
our heart and our brain.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It opens the door to
powerful states of intuition,

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
directly to the subconscious,
deep states of pre-cognition,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.340 align:middle line:84%
all of these things from the
single act of harmonizing

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:90%
our heart and our brain.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:90%
We call that an altered state.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:84%
My sense is it's probably
more the real state,

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and we have strayed
from that, so now it

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
appears altered
and foreign to us.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To think that it's our
mind that controls our heart.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.209 align:middle line:84%
If anyone's ever had an emotion,
they know that it's the heart.

00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: And so think of this.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So Harvard Medical
School in 1932,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
they had to make
a decision, do we

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
think of the human heart
as more than a pump?

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And if so, that leads
in this direction.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going
to simply call it

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:84%
a pump that can be
replaced when it wears out

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.590 align:middle line:90%
and maintained like a machine?

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.256 align:middle line:84%
And that will take
us in this direction.

00:11:45.256 --> 00:11:48.035 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all know pretty
much where the medical model--

00:11:48.035 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Went, yes.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.899 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --chose to go.

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're coming full
circle back to understanding,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.980 align:middle line:84%
our heart is an amazing
pump-- absolutely--

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and that may be the least
of what our heart does.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you
studied indigenous

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:90%
cultures and so forth.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
How can we take this level of
resilience that you talk about

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:90%
and use it to heal our earth?

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Earlier I mentioned
about you bringing about

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
that the extremes
are the new normal,

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and that there is definitely a
whole new sense of-- as we see

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
in the news-- extreme
weather patterns,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
extreme natural
disasters, and so forth,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.990 align:middle line:90%
but that is the new normal.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:90%
You have reframed that for us.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Our
ancestors once again

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
had a greater vision
than what we've

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:90%
been conditioned to accept.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at
large expanses of time.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And they looked
at cycles of time,

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
because nature works in cycles,
and our bodies work in cycles.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of them we're very aware
of-- cycles of night and day,

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
a woman's menstrual
cycle every 28 days tuned

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:90%
to the moon, our sleep cycles.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And some we're less aware of.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And some cover huge
expanses of time

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.040 align:middle line:84%
so long that no one
in a single lifetime

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:90%
remembers those things.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.422 align:middle line:90%
Climate is among those things.

00:13:03.422 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:90%
So I want to be really clear.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:84%
We definitely, I
believe-- in my opinion--

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:84%
we definitely have
the opportunity

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
to stop burning fossil fuels, to

ways of living.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And that opportunity has been
with us for over 60 years.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We've had the technology
for over 60 years.

>>LISA: To feed every
human on the planet.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: To do that, to feed
every human on the planet.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
these cycles of time,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
we are reluctant
sometimes to see them.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So our ancestors, when
they saw the changes,

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
it was less about
healing the earth,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't see
the earth as broken.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:84%
It was about them
allowing themselves

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to move in harmony with the
new cycles that were appearing.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is that we're
living a time of volatility.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
The convergence of three cycles
in our lifetimes-- climate,

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
the economic cycles,
and cycles of conflict--

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
that are all governed
by natural rhythms.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:84%
They are all converging in
this little window of time.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is contributing
to the volatility

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening in
our lives and our world.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we've
been conditioned

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:84%
to think of ourselves as
separate from the world,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to solve our
problems through separation

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:90%
and competition and conflict.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
When the best science,
and our ancestors told us,

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.015 align:middle line:84%
very, very clearly-- science
is telling us today--

00:14:22.015 --> 00:14:23.735 align:middle line:84%
that the fundamental
rule of nature

00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:90%
is cooperation, not competition.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And that we are deeply connected
to the world and ourselves,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:84%
not separate as we've
been led to believe.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And as we shift this
thinking from separation

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:84%
to connection, from
competition to cooperation,

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:84%
that opens the door
to new opportunities

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:90%
of solving the problems.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:90%
The answers are there.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
The key is for us
to find the way

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to shift our thinking to make
it a priority in our lives

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:84%
to help one another
and to begin thinking

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
in terms of cooperation
rather than competition.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's huge.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the new normal.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.984 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Gregg is talking
here in this video about this.

Take a look at Gregg talking
about the new normal.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Hello.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:90%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.870 align:middle line:10%
If you're watching this
film today, what I know

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:10%
is that you do know that this
is a time unlike any other time

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:10%
you've seen, certainly
in this lifetime.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.618 align:middle line:84%
It's different than what
your parents knew in theirs,

00:15:27.618 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:90%
or their parents in theirs.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:84%
The best minds of
our time, in fact,

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:84%
tell us that you
and I are living

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:84%
the emergence of a new
normal, a new way of thinking

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and a new way of living
to reflect the changes

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:90%
in the world around us.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:84%
While this new normal
may not be acknowledged

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
in mainstream media, or in
classrooms or textbooks,

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:84%
you know it's happening
because you're seeing your life

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:84%
change in ways that you simply
have never seen in your life

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the keys to embracing the
opportunities of our new normal

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
lies in a question
we've asked and been

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:84%
conditioned to ask of
ourselves for our entire lives.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:84%
The science of 150 years
has steeped us in the belief

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.652 align:middle line:84%
that we are separate
from ourselves,

00:16:14.652 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:84%
separate from one
another, separate

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
from the world around us,
separate from a higher power.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It's this language
of separation that

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.735 align:middle line:84%
has led to many of the
extremes and the crises

00:16:23.735 --> 00:16:25.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing today,
from the way we deal

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:84%
with the economy, and the
way we deal with shortages

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
of natural resources
and food, the way

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
we share medical
supplies in times

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
of crisis with our brothers and
sisters throughout the world.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It's all been based in this
language of separation.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.080 align:middle line:10%
In the story of
separation, we've

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:10%
been conditioned to ask
this question, what can I

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.575 align:middle line:10%
get from the world that exists?

00:16:47.575 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:10%
Well now, the best
science of our time

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:10%
is telling us that that
belief of separation

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:10%
is no longer true, it never
was, that the best science is

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:10%
actually showing us we are based
upon a world of cooperation

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:10%
and mutual aid.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.859 align:middle line:84%
At the very essence of nature
is cooperation and mutual aid

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.812 align:middle line:84%
in ways that we simply
didn't allow ourselves

00:17:08.812 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:84%
to see in the past, that
we're deeply connected

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to our own bodies,
to one another,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:90%
and to the world around us.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
And with that knowledge it
means that the question we've

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:90%
asked in the past must change.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Rather than asking, what can I
get from the world that exists?

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:84%
The new question now
is, what can I give?

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:25.743 align:middle line:10%
What can I share?

00:17:25.743 --> 00:17:26.659 align:middle line:10%
What can I contribute?

00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:10%
What can I offer to the
world that's emerging?

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:10%
And the way you answer this
question changes everything.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.890 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself
in a job or a career

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that simply doesn't
make sense any longer.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Entire industries now are
collapsing and disappearing,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and people are left wondering,
what am I going to do next?

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.799 align:middle line:84%
The way you answer this
question holds the key

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and makes the difference
between you simply

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:84%
surviving in the times
that we're living now--

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
our time of extremes-- and
thriving in a time of extremes.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I live in northern New
Mexico, and a good friend

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
of mine-- a neighbor--
found himself

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:90%
in precisely this situation.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:90%
He was a builder of homes.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
People didn't need homes in
2008 and after the housing

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:90%
market collapsed.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But they did need to be
able to care for themselves.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And Ken asked himself--
Ken is my friend's name--

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.197 align:middle line:90%
he asked himself this question.

00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, what do my friends and
family and neighbors need now?

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:90%
They don't need homes.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, but they need a way to
grow their own food that they

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:84%
can rely upon, that
they know is safe,

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
that they know is inexpensive.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:90%
He took his skills as a builder.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:10%
He prototyped, designed,
and built an entire system

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:10%
of modular green houses.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.510 align:middle line:10%
They're raised bed greenhouses,
self-watering, self-heating.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
They're covered.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:90%
They can be used to grow food.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Any temperatures, anywhere in
the world, any time of year.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
They can be 12
inches square and fit

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:84%
on a patio in a
high-rise in New York.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Or they can be 4
feet by 8 feet, side

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
by side, in rows, where we have
a lot of land in northern New

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Mexico and southern Colorado.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:84%
The point is that Ken
simply changed the question,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:84%
recognizing the new
normal is emerging

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and that the skills as he
had used them in the past

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:90%
were no longer needed.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:90%
He said, what can I give?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.760 align:middle line:90%
What can I offer?

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
What can I share with
the world as it is now?

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And when he did
that, he embraced

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
one of the strategies that
is outlined and detailed

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
in the new book, "The
Turning Point: Creating

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Resilience in the
Time of Extremes,"

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.081 align:middle line:84%
my book that I designed
for you to help precisely

00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:84%
through the kinds of changes
we're seeing in our world

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.278 align:middle line:90%
So I hope you enjoy the book.

00:19:32.278 --> 00:19:35.179 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that these strategies
work for you as well as they've

00:19:35.179 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:90%
worked for everyone else.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I know they will if you
give them the opportunity.

I was trained as a scientist.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:90%
I think science is good.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Science does not
have all the answers.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:90%
In many places, it's incomplete.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
an opportunity now

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to marry the best science
of the 21st century

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
with the wisdom of 5,000
years of our ancestors.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Marry those two
great ways of knowing

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
into a single wisdom that's
more than either could be alone,

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that I think gives us the
evolutionary edge to transcend.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Not just survive, but
to thrive and transcend

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.327 align:middle line:84%
the time of extremes,
to become better people

00:20:42.327 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and create a better world.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:90%
So I'm optimistic.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I've never been more optimistic
about our world, my life,

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:90%
our nation, all nations.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm also a realist.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And I am under no illusion of
the tremendous amount of work

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:84%
that it takes to shift from
a mindset of competition,

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
conflict, and separation,
to cooperation,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.987 align:middle line:90%
mutual aid, and connection.

00:21:07.987 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And that shows up
in everything we do.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It shows up in our
relationship with our families,

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
with our loved ones,
with our friends.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.890 align:middle line:90%
It shows up at work.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It shows up in the way
we think about ourselves

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:19.590 align:middle line:90%
on these really deep levels.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:24.117 align:middle line:84%
It's such a powerful
fundamental shift in thinking.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So it does take a
tremendous amount of work.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And the great
profit Khalil Gibran

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:84%
made a statement about work that
I think of almost every day.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:84%
My mom shared it
with me in 1966,

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's been with me
from that point forward.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
She gave me the book
and underlined this.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Khalil Gibran-- he said, work
is our love made visible.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Work is our love made visible.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.495 align:middle line:84%
So the work that we
have in front of us

00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
is an opportunity
for us to demonstrate

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:84%
visibly our love for
ourselves and our world

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:84%
by creating something
new and beautiful

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and powerful and
sacred and sustainable.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I am optimistic
about the world.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That's a long answer
to a short question, but--

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, I'm so
grateful for that.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.045 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many questions
I would ask you about that.

00:22:07.045 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back to the
indigenous part of-- not so far

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:84%
from here, there's a wonderful
man that you found that you had

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:90%
the privilege--

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --I found.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.128 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: You found--
you had the privilege

00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:10%
of speaking with over and over
again-- the Grandfather Martin.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: Was his name, yeah.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And tell us
the story about him.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:10%
Well, we are filming
in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:10%
and just north of where we
are now is the Hopi land.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And on the Third Mesa-- what's
called the Third Mesa-- of Hopi

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
land is a very
mysterious rock face.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Prophecy Rock is the term.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.230 align:middle line:84%
It is a rock face
of petroglyphs that

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.890 align:middle line:84%
have been there for so long
no one's even really sure who

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
put them there.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But what the Hopi say is that
the end of the last cycle

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
of change, this map of time
was left for them, as well

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
as a way of being within
that time, to help

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
them successfully
transcend the change.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's two things.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It is a map of events
that are happening.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are signs
on this rock that

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.972 align:middle line:84%
can be correlated with events
like World War I and World War

00:23:16.972 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
II, things like that--
they're called the Great

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Shakings-- of the past
along the timeline,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and the Hopi will
interpret that for us.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I've had
the opportunity

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
to be with the Hopi-- and
Grandfather Martin was

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:84%
the eldest elder of the
Hopi until, and I believe,

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:90%
he passed in 2014.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.155 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity of
sharing the stage with him

00:23:39.155 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:84%
at a number of conferences
in the years prior to that

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:90%
and until 2014.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And so what Grandfather
Martin would share--

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and others-- about
Prophecy Rock is what

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:90%
these mysterious glyphs mean.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
They essentially show two paths
that humans had the opportunity

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
to walk at the end of the
last cycle through the cycle

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:90%
that we are now living now.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:84%
One path looks
like an easy path.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Both of them begin very similar,
and then one begins to incline.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:84%
It gets a little rough,
and then it stops abruptly.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:90%
It goes nowhere.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a path that goes nowhere.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:84%
There are people on
that path, their heads

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:90%
are separated from their bodies.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And that
is interpreted

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.116 align:middle line:84%
as being people who are lost,
that do not know themselves.

00:24:24.116 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Disconnected.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yes.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.333 align:middle line:84%
They don't know themselves
is what they say.

00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:84%
The second path, the lower
path, also has people.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:90%
They are hunched over.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:35.159 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman is hunched over,
indicating advanced age.

00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a stalk of corn
growing behind him.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Food is plentiful on that path.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't get
rough and inclined.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
It is a smooth path
that goes all the way

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:90%
around the corner of the rock.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:84%
The corner is
interpreted to be the end

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.672 align:middle line:84%
of this great cycle of
change, the transition

00:24:51.672 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:90%
that we're going through now.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And this path-- smoothly--
goes through that

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and continues into
the next cycle,

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
into the new world that
we're now birthing.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
It parallels the 2012 prophecies
and many of the others.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I asked them was,
what are the characteristics

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
that will help us to
move through these times?

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:84%
What are the characteristics
of both paths?

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.476 align:middle line:84%
And the one on top that
is rough and goes nowhere,

00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:84%
the characteristics
he said people that

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:84%
live on this path, their
characteristics of their lives

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
are those of comfort,
greed, and profit.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Comfort, greed, and profit.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:26.685 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, profit.

00:25:26.685 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting word.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, does it mean--

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, profit--
P-R-O-F-I-T-- I see.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean we
shouldn't make money?

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, it's
not that kind of profit.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the profit where
one person benefits

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.070 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of another, where
people do well while others

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.664 align:middle line:90%
suffer to support them.

00:25:43.664 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
He said that's the kind of
profit that goes nowhere.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know, I
certainly agree with that.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:84%
The lower path,
the characteristics

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
were love, strength,
and balance.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And what really struck
me with each of these

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:84%
is, comfort, greed,
and profit, those

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:03.069 align:middle line:84%
are things that we can
actually do-- comfort, greed,

00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and profit-- but the love,
strength, and balance, these

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
are states that we become.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's a way of being.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what he's saying
is, in his tradition,

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.145 align:middle line:84%
what our most cherished and
ancient spiritual traditions

00:26:14.145 --> 00:26:15.520 align:middle line:84%
have always said,
is that when we

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
find a way to move into
our hearts in cooperation,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that is the key
that will carry us

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.440 align:middle line:84%
through these times of extremes
and give us the resilience.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:90%
In a healthy way.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing, we want to
find the way in a healthy way

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the change,
not just, like,

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:84%
cling to a thin thread of
survival and just squeak by.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
We want to thrive
in this new world.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:90%
And this is what they're saying.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know what
the world is going to be,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:84%
but if you can
become these things,

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.010 align:middle line:84%
then you will be prepared
for whatever the world brings

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:90%
to your doorstep.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.740 align:middle line:84%
How long ago do you
think that these

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.797 align:middle line:90%
were carved, these etches?

00:26:50.797 --> 00:26:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's a
really good question.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
What they believe is
that they were put there

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the last
cycle when people were just

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:90%
beginning this cycle.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying this
is what we now remember.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:84%
This is our
experience to pass on

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
to those who we could
only see in our dreams

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:84%
because we'll never
see the actual people.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, what makes
this really, really

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:84%
interesting as a
geologist, what I

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:84%
can tell you is that last
cycle, 5,000 years ago, we're

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:84%
now finding evidence of advanced
technological civilizations

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
over three times that age,
back into the last ice age,

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:90%
and now before.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is not the first
technological civilization

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.140 align:middle line:90%
that's been here.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:90%
But here's the key.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.750 align:middle line:84%
All of those ancient
civilizations,

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
there's no evidence of
war, no evidence, no walls

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to protect the cities, no
evidence of any weapons,

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.060 align:middle line:84%
no mass graves that you
would expect after war.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.130 align:middle line:90%
None of that has been found.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The first large-scale war
was discovered-- the evidence

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.500 align:middle line:84%
of that war was ancient
Sumeria 5,000 years ago, right

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of this cycle.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And what scientists
now believe, and they

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.965 align:middle line:84%
were surprised to see this
new evidence-- only since 2008

00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:05.530 align:middle line:90%
have they discovered this.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a massive climate
shift 5,000 years ago,

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:84%
very similar to the one
that we're living now.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was the trigger for the
first great wars in our world

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.080 align:middle line:84%
because people
suddenly were competing

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:90%
for these vital resources.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And what makes this
interesting is now,

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years later, we're going
through a very similar climate

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:90%
shift.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.740 align:middle line:84%
The question is, will we
follow the path of the past?

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.665 align:middle line:90%
Will we choose war?

00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:35.752 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.752 --> 00:28:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So far, though.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Because we are
afraid of the scarcity

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:90%
of the resources?

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Or we choose cooperation
and mutual aid.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.367 align:middle line:84%
And we're making that
choice right now.

00:28:43.367 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're right
in the middle of it.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, we are.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:90%
And for me, this is the value.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:84%
People say, this is
the 21st century.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Why would you look
and spend your time

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.980 align:middle line:84%
exploring these
civilizations of the past?

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And are they old?

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.235 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:55.235 --> 00:28:56.035 align:middle line:90%
But we can learn.

00:28:56.035 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They teach us, yes.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.275 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We can
learn from them.

00:28:58.275 --> 00:29:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can discover what
worked and what didn't.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And the things that didn't
work, let's stop doing them.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.281 align:middle line:84%
The things that did work,
let's do a lot of them.

00:29:04.281 --> 00:29:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And community and
cooperation are the keys.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Community and
cooperation are what

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:84%
helped them thrive in the
presence of these great changes

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.535 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot help but think
that our lives are very similar

00:29:19.535 --> 00:29:22.200 align:middle line:84%
to that now, and that the same
things will benefit us now.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.665 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're looking at wars
being fought over oil at same

00:29:24.665 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:90%
time as renewable sources--

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.873 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Oil, water food.

00:29:26.873 --> 00:29:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Water, of
course, and food.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
renewable sources

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
that at the exact
same time, they're

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.210 align:middle line:84%
being created so fast
with electric cars

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and solar paneling
and, I mean, the wind,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.097 align:middle line:84%
all of the energy that's able
to be created is endless.

00:29:45.097 --> 00:29:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, these
wars are being fought.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.350 align:middle line:90%
So how do you live personally?

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:90%
How do you live?

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Oh, you saved the
easy questions for last.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.310 align:middle line:90%
And can you help me understand.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:84%
When you say how do you
live what do you mean?

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I know you're
in Northern New Mexico.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And do you live in a place
that is-- when you said earlier

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:84%
in the interview that we
are one with the Earth

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and that we are in this
oneness and everything that we

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
do directly will
impact our future,

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:90%
do you live off of the grid?

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you live in a way that
is one with the Earth?

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: To the
best of my ability.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.052 align:middle line:84%
I found the property
where I am now.

00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
If you or your

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:84%
familiar with Rudolf
Steiner, the Steiner

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:90%
schools and principle--

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When I left the
corporations in the 90's, I

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.434 align:middle line:90%
found this land.

00:30:32.434 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the first
Steiner schools that was built

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:84%
in North America
in the late 1800's.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:38.993 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And it is
made of the Earth.

00:30:38.993 --> 00:30:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They are Adobe buildings,
12-inch thick Adobe bricks.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And my home and the
land that I bought

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:84%
is an hour from
the nearest town.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.112 align:middle line:84%
It's about a mile from
the nearest neighbor.

00:30:51.112 --> 00:30:53.266 align:middle line:90%
It is not convenient at all.

00:30:53.266 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I left
the corporations,

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.598 align:middle line:90%
I had to make a choice.

00:30:55.598 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, do I want to wake up
every morning in a place that's

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:03.040 align:middle line:84%
convenient to my work
and my health care

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and the airport, which
I've done all my life,

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.910 align:middle line:84%
or do I want to wake up
surrounded by beauty?

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:90%
And I made the choice of beauty.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And this was March 17th,
1 o'clock in afternoon,

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.030 align:middle line:84%
1990, when I walked out the
door of the corporation,

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:17.540 align:middle line:90%
the last one I worked for.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cisco.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And it
was a good choice.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not an easy way of life.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:90%
But it is it's very different.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And so that has been my
primary home since 1990.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.900 align:middle line:90%
My mother's health has declined.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And we've had to move
her to a better facility,

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:90%
now in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we have another
place in Santa Fe

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.340 align:middle line:90%
that does get me closer to her.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
It gets me closer to
the airport because I'm

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:90%
flying all the time.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:90%
And we do our very best.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:90%
We grow a lot of our own food.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Solar is
a part of our lives.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:90%
We have no public utilities.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any public
water public or public sewage

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.210 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
they call it primitive.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I consider it rustic.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.970 align:middle line:90%
But it's not primitive.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.386 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
very sustainable.

00:32:07.386 --> 00:32:09.010 align:middle line:90%
And I feel very good.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And my wife Martha and
I have made the choice

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:90%
to live that way.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:84%

She came in.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:17.990 align:middle line:90%
We had our first snow this week.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.524 align:middle line:84%
She came in from

know what she was bringing.

00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:24.572 align:middle line:84%
And broccoli is one of my
favorite foods on the planet.

00:32:24.572 --> 00:32:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And she had this beautiful,
perfect stalk of broccoli

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:90%
that survived the blizzard.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.906 align:middle line:90%
She said, look what we grew.

00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] I know.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:90%
It's so fun.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.990 align:middle line:90%
You pick your own vegetables.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And we are getting back to that.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
resilience ultimately

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:84%
is is how we can be resilient
with our Earth, with ourselves,

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:84%
with our work, with every
single thing that we do.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And it ultimately has to do
with, as your book states,

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.170 align:middle line:90%
the heart.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It begins with
the heart for us personally.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to both
us and community, one

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.660 align:middle line:84%
of the first principles
of resilience-- and I do,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:84%
I talk about it in
the book-- is what's

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.710 align:middle line:84%
called the principle
of spare capacity.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:84%
That is the first
principle of resilience.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And for us, it means
emotional spare capacity.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.540 align:middle line:84%
It means physical
spare capacity.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It means the ability to charge
our emotional batteries,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.830 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to the point
where when life changes occur,

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
we're not leveled you
know, the first thing that

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.100 align:middle line:90%
doesn't go our way.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are very
specific techniques

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.740 align:middle line:84%
to do that based in science,
taught by indigenous ancestors.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:10%
The institute of
HeartMath, and I

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.660 align:middle line:10%
think you may have worked
with them on this program

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:10%
or maybe you will, in
Northern California

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:40.570 align:middle line:10%
is pioneering this research
into the power of the heart

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.820 align:middle line:10%
in nontraditional ways,
things that you're not

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.650 align:middle line:10%
going to learn about in the
medical books or the textbooks.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:48.025 align:middle line:84%
And they have done amazing
work with resilience research.

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:50.482 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really, wow, fantastic.

00:33:50.482 --> 00:33:52.065 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They're
helping communities.

00:33:52.065 --> 00:33:53.580 align:middle line:84%
They are also
helping the military.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.090 align:middle line:84%
They're helping people
to find that resilience

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:57.220 align:middle line:90%
before they go into combat.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And also, coming home to
reintegrate into their homes

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and families and communities is
something that a lot of people

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:90%
don't think about.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But you're in battlefield
conditions one day

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.020 align:middle line:90%
that serve you.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:84%
And then 72 hours later, you're
on a plane back to Chicago.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.989 align:middle line:84%
And so they're helping
to reintegrate.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
this connection

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:84%
between the heart and the
brain and how we consciously

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.560 align:middle line:90%
manage this connection.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is fueled
by our emotions.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
ability to determine

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:90%
which emotions we're creating.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And that sends a signal
to our brain that releases

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:90%
the chemistry into our body.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we want healthy,
life-affirming chemistry,

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
we've got to find the language
between the heart and the brain

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.760 align:middle line:90%
to send that signal.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the resilience
training is all about.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:43.575 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
kinds of resilience.

00:34:43.575 --> 00:34:45.275 align:middle line:84%
It means different things
to different people.

00:34:45.275 --> 00:34:45.739 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it does.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:46.139 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.264 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Personal resilience,
community resilience

00:34:48.264 --> 00:34:51.750 align:middle line:84%
is about spare capacity for the
community and what's needed.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:10%
And I think some
people-- I just want

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.195 align:middle line:10%
to say this-- in our community,
our New Thought Community,

00:34:56.195 --> 00:34:57.570 align:middle line:10%
I've had people
say to me, Gregg,

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.190 align:middle line:10%
isn't that fear
based if you have

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.572 align:middle line:10%
some extra food in your shelves
or you've got a back-up power

00:35:03.572 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:10%
or something like that?

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.160 align:middle line:10%
And my answer to that, and
I want to be really clear.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.600 align:middle line:10%
If we're honest with
ourselves about where

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.540 align:middle line:10%
we are in life right
now, we are living

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.090 align:middle line:10%
a rare and precious
moment of extremes.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And a hallmark of the extremes
is volatility in the things

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.650 align:middle line:84%
that we've taken for
granted in the past.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Climate change is
a perfect example.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:25.520 align:middle line:84%
All it takes is one
big storm to knock out

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.510 align:middle line:84%
the travel between one
community and the next.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
grocery shelves are bare.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing this
time and time again.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So I personally believe
it's a responsible thing

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to do, to be honest, truthful,
and factual with ourselves.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.547 align:middle line:90%
Not about fear.

00:35:40.547 --> 00:35:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Just be responsible.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Say you know?

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going through this
little bump of volatility.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.030 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense for us
and for our families.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying go
whole hog survival.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.010 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is a good idea
to have water and food.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When the hurricanes
hit the East Coast,

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
a perfect example, the
grocery shops, the stores,

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.597 align:middle line:84%
the shelves were
bare the next day.

00:36:02.597 --> 00:36:04.430 align:middle line:84%
For some of those people,
it was three weeks

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:05.888 align:middle line:84%
before they had
grocery deliveries.

00:36:05.888 --> 00:36:07.590 align:middle line:84%
People were going
through dumpsters.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.340 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get any
gasoline to anyone.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get any fuel
supplies, people's homes.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And they say, how could that
happened in the 20th century

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:90%
in New York?

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just New York.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.930 align:middle line:84%
It's happening in other
countries as well.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So spare
capacity make sense.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:90%
I think it's responsible.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:90%
It's conscious.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's not about fear.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just about
embracing the reality

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're living
today so that we can

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.200 align:middle line:90%
thrive into this next reality.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.387 align:middle line:84%
And our ancestors,
Hopi and others,

00:36:37.387 --> 00:36:38.470 align:middle line:90%
are very clear about that.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.115 align:middle line:90%
They do exactly the same thing.

00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was prophesized.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to wrap up by--
I talked a little bit earlier

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.410 align:middle line:90%
about the I Am statement.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And this has taken on
such a beautiful theme

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.370 align:middle line:90%
throughout this entire series.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:84%
In this moment for you, Gregg,
what is your I Am statement.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When I hear
the words and when

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I say the words, because
of my scholarly work

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.600 align:middle line:84%
into the most cherished
and ancient traditions,

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I Am is a declaration
to the universe where

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.420 align:middle line:84%
we claim within ourselves the
things that we have stated

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.370 align:middle line:84%
to others that we choose
to be and that we choose

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:84%
to embody in our lives,
where we actually-- it

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:23.860 align:middle line:84%
is a command into the matrix of
the field of the universe where

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.820 align:middle line:84%
we claim the very
things in our lives

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that we say with the words
that we want in our hearts.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's the opportunity
to actually embrace

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:84%
the deepest truths
of our existence

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and the limitless capacity
for love and compassion

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have as we go
through these changes.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.360 align:middle line:90%
So that is the I Am for me.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I got from your
entire body of work,

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.060 align:middle line:84%
as I was looking through it,
is that I Am Cooperation.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful way
of looking at coherence

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.760 align:middle line:84%
with the universe, people
around me, and the field.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.660 align:middle line:90%
