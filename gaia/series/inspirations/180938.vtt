00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Why do some
people have a fear of success,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:90%
and others don't?

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Why do some people make
money and then lose it?

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Is this a matter of
cultural beliefs?

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:10%
And joining me is
neuropsychologist

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Mario Martinez,
whose biocognitive theory

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:10%
brings together insights
from medicine, psychology,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:10%
anthropology, and
spirituality to make

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:10%
sense of these questions.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARIO MARTINEZ: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about
this psychology of abundance.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to know, what is it?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: The best way to look
at is to start with a culture.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:10%
A culture, the way I define
it, is a collective belief

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:10%
of things that are
really important in life,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:10%
like health, ethics,
aesthetics, wellness, abundance.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And without knowing
it, that culture

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:84%
teaches you the
ceilings of what it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.260 align:middle line:84%
should be at a certain
age, what it shouldn't be.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And although
they'll say, well, I

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
want you to make as much
money as you wanted,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
when you go beyond
a certain ceiling,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
it's just as if you're having
some kind of an anxiety

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.350 align:middle line:90%
reaction.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.184 align:middle line:84%
So you have to come back to what
is comfortable within the pale.

00:01:33.184 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Unconsciously?

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
based on the tribe.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: On the tribe, yes.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They didn't
want you to leave.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
They wanted you to
stay within the tribe.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: They
want you to stay,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
because the tribe wants
you to work collectively

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:90%
for the tribe.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you leave,
you're an outlier.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you're no
longer doing that.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So then what they do is
they want to keep you there.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you return, at first,
if you return successful,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:90%
it's fine.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:90%
You're a hero.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
then they want

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
to cut the hero down and
bring him down to size,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:90%
so you don't go beyond the pale.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Now does this still apply, even
though cultures are so diluted

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: It does, because we
have a multicultural country,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:10%
but in each family
you have a culture

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:10%
that dominates a little
bit more than the other.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:10%
And that's what you assimilate.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:10%
Then, of course, you pick up
whatever you learn in school.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a combination,
but it's all cultural.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:90%
The teacher has a culture.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
The doctor has a culture,
and they bring it in.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
In Bolivia, there is quite
a bit of malnutrition,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:90%
so anemia is very common.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you have anemia, and
you're a mestizo or white,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the mestizos, which are
half white, half Indians,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
they associate themselves
or identify with the white.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And the natives are
lower in socioeconomics.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.315 align:middle line:84%
If you have anemia
and you're a native,

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
the shaman will call
it [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:90%
which is a terminal illness.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:84%
No amount of Western
medicine will intervene.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
The whites and the
mestizos, you have anemia,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.465 align:middle line:84%
you have B12 or whatever,
and you're cured.

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:02.215 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing about it is here

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
is socioeconomics again.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
The government of
Bolivia gave the natives

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot of land as
an agrarian reform.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the natives went
up from the mestizos.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:90%
The mestizos dropped.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
They could no longer
identify with the whites.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And when they had anemia,
it would be [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:90%
and they would die.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So
it's very powerful

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:84%
because your immune system
and your nervous system

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
will adhere to the social and
cultural beliefs that you have,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
because when we're born,
we're designed to pick up

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
on what I call the cultural
elders, people that

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.370 align:middle line:90%
are really important in life.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're hungry, and you
have a physiology of hunger.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Then you see a breast
or you see a bottle.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's a physiology of
hunger, satiation of hunger.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Than later you know
that's a breast.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:90%
That's mother.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But you already
have a physiology,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:90%
and then it becomes a symbol.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And that same thing
happens with abundance.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Abundance, to a
certain level, is fine.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Then after a certain level,
intellectually, you say, no.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:90%
This is fine.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:90%
I deserve everything.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But then you start finding
ways that you're really

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
sabotaging yourself because of
these ceilings of abundance.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this why
if a family maybe

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:84%
goes through a financial
crisis, then 30, 40 years later,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:84%
you'll mimic the same
financial crisis as an adult?

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even though you've
tried everything to avoid it.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, you've
tried everything,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.419 align:middle line:84%
because intellectually
you'll say, no, no.

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.969 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
be like my parents.

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's built into the system.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.968 align:middle line:84%
Now there are ways of
coming out of that,

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:90%
but it's built into the system.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say, I'm never
going to be like my dad.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And you're just like your dad.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this where
the fear of abundance

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:84%
came from, if there
is such a thing?

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Let me give an example.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:84%
You see your dad trying and
trying and trying and working

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
hard, and he never makes it.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So in your mind, you say,
I'm going to work harder.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But the biocognition
that you have learned

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
is no matter how hard I try,
I'm never going to make it,

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:84%
because of the model that
you learned from your dad.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So you have that, and
then you do better.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you do better,
something happens.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And you say, wait a
minute, not consciously.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.290 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't fit.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with this picture?

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
happens subconsciously

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.714 align:middle line:84%
is that if you do
better than your dad,

00:05:08.714 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:90%
you're dishonoring your dad.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.861 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So I've had many
patients who have that problem.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.443 align:middle line:84%
We have to work through
that, and they didn't even

00:05:15.443 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
know they were feeling
that way, that to do better

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.554 align:middle line:84%
is to dishonor the person that
I honored and that is my hero.

00:05:22.554 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
do the same thing.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
You teach people how to really
look at things differently so

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:90%
that you change cultural norms.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a specific
exercise around that?

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:90%
You're saying look at it.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:10%
Identify it first,
and then what?

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Let's use
the example of abundance.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
to do is you have

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
to get into a relaxed
state, so that the brain

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:90%
doesn't create anxiety for you.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:84%
It could be relaxation,
meditation, whatever.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.227 align:middle line:84%
Once you get to that
contemplative level,

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:90%
then you do the technique.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And you stop, and you say, let's
say I'm making $20,000 a year

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's say that's what you make.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, and
I pay these bills.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:90%
I do this.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I do that.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you check the
body as you're doing that.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Then you go, now I'm
making $80,000 a year.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And what am I doing
with that money?

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:90%
And you do the imagery.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back to the body
to see what the body is doing.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.423 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing
is you're desensitizing

00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:21.815 align:middle line:84%
the levels of abundance that
your mind-body can accept.

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you're
going to go out and make it.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.734 align:middle line:84%
But what will happen is that you
will look at the opportunities

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't look
at before, because that

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
was the cultural ceiling
that you created.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.917 align:middle line:90%
And you do this over and over.

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've had many, many
patients who tell me

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:90%
that they found a new job.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
They started making more
money, because the perception

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:90%
opened up.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're not
attracting anything.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.348 align:middle line:90%
It's the perception opens up.

00:06:44.348 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, but what if you
are making that $20,000,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're living beyond your
means, like most Americans are?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And they feel
anxiety about that,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:90%
and they feel stress about that.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And so there goes
the coherent state.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:10%
There goes that
contemplative state.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And how do you get
yourself out of that?

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, the next part
of that is to look at, let's

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
say, whatever you're making,
and you're beyond your means.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Then what are the basic
things that you really

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
need to make you happy?

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And then that
becomes the priority,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to get rid
of all the other things,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:90%
the overreaction.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
never go shopping

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:84%
when you're hungry because
you're going to buy

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:90%
more food and things like that.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So this technique
will also teach you

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.417 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you're doing
that it's beyond your means,

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:84%
because if you, for example,
let's say you're making 20,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.557 align:middle line:84%
or you do this, and
you're making 80.

00:07:35.557 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And you notice that
you're doing this.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.223 align:middle line:84%
And you go back, and you
say, well, in both cases,

00:07:39.223 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm going beyond my means.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:90%
That's insights.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you go into abundance
has to be quality of life, not

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:90%
accumulation.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So you change the meaning of
abundance, quality of life.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you go from
the $20,000 in your mind

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to the $80,000 in
your mind, and you

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
become living within your means,
so that that is associated

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
with no anxiety, with stress
free and great relationships,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, and
then one of the ways

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
to really figure out if
you are where you are,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I did one that I was
making $1 billion a year.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.516 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back,
you find that it doesn't

00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:90%
change your life very much.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Then you're on target.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So someone
can mimic the patterns

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and you said the editors
of culture in a family.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And does that
eventually manifest?

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:10%
Like, in an abundance
case, it could manifest

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:10%
into a loss of finances.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:84%
In a health situation, it could
manifest into disease, right?

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, and the myth
that a family illness is just

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:90%
a myth.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
It's only a propensity to
be expressed with diet,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:90%
environments, and beliefs.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying, oh, everybody
in your family has diabetes.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, the propensity
will be very high.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And then some reductionists
will say, well, look.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:90%
The mother has it.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:90%
The sister has it.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, they all eat
the same thing.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.126 align:middle line:84%
They live in the same place,
and they have the same belief

00:09:01.126 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.741 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, and
it's very unconscious.

00:09:03.741 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Very
unconscious, but then you

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:84%
find an outlier in that family
who doesn't have diabetes,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and you will see
that that person is

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
acting differently and
living differently and not

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:90%
buying into the script.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Outliers.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:10%
So do they really have
to go against the grain?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Or can they-- they really do.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.671 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, you have
to go against the grain

00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:90%
in order to grow.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you'll be in the
collective mentality that's

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.417 align:middle line:84%
good for the collective, but you
have to individualize yourself.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:10%
And you have to go
out and do whatever

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.083 align:middle line:10%
it is that you need to do.

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: But then how do you
not sabotage yourself based

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.446 align:middle line:10%
on that cultural belief still?

00:09:35.446 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, that's
a really good point.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I try to do is I ask
people to create subcultures

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:90%
of wellness.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say that
you have lied all your life,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden you
say, I want to be truthful.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And your friends
say you're a liar.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.467 align:middle line:84%
And you go to your friends, and
you say something that's true.

00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:90%
And they say, no, come on.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.330 align:middle line:90%
You always tell lies.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.746 align:middle line:10%
Those people are
going to keep you

00:09:57.746 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:10%
within that sphere of
your archetype of a liar.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Now in a subculture of wellness,
you don't have a history.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.100 align:middle line:90%
And you talk to them.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.964 align:middle line:84%
They see what you're
saying as truth.

00:10:07.964 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you say, I'm a truthful
person, that's really good.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I like truthful people.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:90%
So they change the script.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:90%
But we're social beings.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We need people that
support our beliefs

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and confirm our
goodness and confirm

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:90%
whatever we're learning.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
abundance, does it

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on
our physiology,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
on wellness, and on longevity,
which you know so much about?

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, yes.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that you get
to a level of abundance

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
that either you
don't feel worthy,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.407 align:middle line:84%
or that you're dishonoring the
people where you came from.

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:41.615 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be stressful.

00:10:41.615 --> 00:10:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be stressful.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.411 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
in a chronic state

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
of cortisol and norepinephrine
and inflammatory kinds

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:90%
of molecules.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.157 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, well,
that will have an effect.

00:10:51.157 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.816 align:middle line:84%
And so you could create
an illness from abundance.

00:10:54.816 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, you could.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you
don't really become

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
aware, first of
all, of all of this.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.895 align:middle line:84%
And once you do become
aware of it, what do you do?

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Then when
you become aware,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at people
that you know who are out

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:90%
of the pale within the family.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:90%
You need models.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
anybody in the family,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
a well-known person, you have
to find a hero or heroine

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:90%
to actually say, OK.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
There's evidence that
this person made it

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:90%
without getting sick.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
That evidence, it
has a placebo effect.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:26.390 align:middle line:90%
It has a value to it.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to imitate
how that person lives.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see that
they have different scripts,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.236 align:middle line:90%
and they support your abundance.

00:11:32.236 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
When you go to them with your
abundance, they support it.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.443 align:middle line:90%
They don't knock it.

00:11:35.443 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't bring you
back into the pale.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:90%
What about culturally?

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So there is an area,
they say the Midwest,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
where there is a low amount
of iodine because of the lack

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:90%
of exposure to the sea.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And that area has a large
incidence of thyroid disorders.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So is this a
cultural experience,

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
or is this something that
is centered around location?

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well,
the environment

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:90%
is really important.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.917 align:middle line:84%
Iodine is very
important, for example.

00:12:06.917 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Places where there's
not a lot of magnesium,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:90%
people have heart problems.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And so definitely the
environment and the nutrition

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and the kinds of things,
vitamins and minerals,

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:90%
are really very important.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:84%
That's necessary,
but not sufficient,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
because you could have a place
where they have the iodine.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.333 align:middle line:84%
And you have this,
and they have that.

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And they still have
thyroid problems.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that person
moves to the ocean,

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and they still have
the thyroid problems.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.971 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And they still
have thyroid problems.

00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Mind and body are
inseparable from the culture.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The way that I try
to explain it is

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that the world has
infinite possibilities

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:90%
of being interpreted.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And the cultural
will weave a fabric,

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and our brain will read the
fabric, not what's out there.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the mind and body
are inseparable, you just said.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Completely, and the
brain is culturally designed.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.670 align:middle line:84%
The immune system is
culturally designed.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
When you, for example,
shame somebody

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
in an individualist
culture, they'll

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.280 align:middle line:84%
have inflammatory molecules,
tumor necrosis factor

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:90%
and other molecules.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.833 align:middle line:84%
The only way that
you can explain this

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the immune system has
a biosymbolic interpretation.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, how could
a word of your stupid,

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:84%
how could that turn
into a biology?

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Because it's biosymbolic.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:90%
It has a bioinformational field.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
It has to because you have
a language, so it has to.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Animals don't have
a word to say, look.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.054 align:middle line:90%
That's poisonous.

00:13:29.054 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So when we developed the
language and consciousness,

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
the immune system
went into that stage

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.612 align:middle line:90%
also and became biosymbolic.

00:13:35.612 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
hard to understand,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen it so
much in good research,

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
as well as with
patients, and also going

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:90%
to different cultures.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Biosymbolic,
that's fascinating.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So the example I gave
earlier, maybe if somebody

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:84%
were to win the
lottery, and we've

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
heard many times those
people, a large percentage,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
lose all of it within the
first year and a half.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
because of the fact

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that they were never raised
with that environment

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
around having an
abundance of money?

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes,
people that have

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
abundance are taught that
money is a natural thing.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.146 align:middle line:90%
Money works for you.

00:14:11.146 --> 00:14:12.229 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just always there.

00:14:12.229 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: This
is a natural thing.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a
deprivation mode,

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.532 align:middle line:84%
you learn the mode
of deprivation.

00:14:17.532 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Then when you come out
of the deprivation mode,

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.446 align:middle line:84%
you have to learn
non-deprivation.

00:14:21.446 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And we don't do that.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We just make the money
and begin to get sick

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
or give it away to an accountant
who steals it or whatever

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.900 align:middle line:84%
in order to come back to
that ceiling that keeps

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:90%
you miserably comfortable.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:84%
You would actually attract an
accountant to steal your money.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wouldn't you?

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.043 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:14:42.043 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:90%
So how do we raise the ceiling?

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
How do we get rid of this
cultural unconsciousness

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.347 align:middle line:84%
and change those patterns if
we don't defect from the tribe?

00:14:53.347 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, the first
thing is intellectual,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.513 align:middle line:84%
and then you have to work
it through existentially

00:14:57.513 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and experientially.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.067 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is that
you know that there

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.900 align:middle line:84%
are people who are
really bad, and they have

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.454 align:middle line:90%
good things happen to them.

00:15:04.454 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And you have good
people, and they

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.161 align:middle line:90%
have bad things happen to them.

00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not because of merit.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not that it is
meritorious that I

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:84%
have this because I've earned
it, and I'm a good person.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
You already have that
nature within you

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
of abundance of health,
wealth, and love.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:84%
If you begin to believe that,
and experiment with that,

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and begin to see that
it's there, then when

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.002 align:middle line:90%
it comes to you it's natural.

00:15:25.002 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But you also have to
have the subcultures

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to support the belief
system that you have.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, children
will have hallucinations

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that are things that
you can't explain.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:38.079 align:middle line:84%
They say, I saw this lady
that was talking to me,

00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:90%
and she looked like this.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.359 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
great-grandmother that he

00:15:41.359 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:90%
never heard about or never saw.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe some
things that they see--

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.380 align:middle line:90%
and what they is they kill.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.963 align:middle line:84%
And they say, no,
no, darling, no, no.

00:15:46.963 --> 00:15:48.929 align:middle line:84%
You just made that
up in your head.

00:15:48.929 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And then they kill it, and they
bring you back to the culture

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.829 align:middle line:90%
where you're comfortable.

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm, and
then they discount

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:90%
any ability to be psychic, yes.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.989 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: That's right, yeah.

00:15:58.989 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So how do
you explain someone

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:10%
like an Elon Musk
or someone who came

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:10%
from a very difficult background
and becomes a bazillionaire?

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, first,
you look at their health.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:84%
If their health is
good, then they're OK.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, that's the
first thing that I look at.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have a guru
who is morbidly obese

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.185 align:middle line:84%
and is doing diets,
you have to live it.

00:16:21.185 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:90%
You have to live it.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.666 align:middle line:90%
So if he's healthy, great.

00:16:25.666 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And there are people.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:90%
There are outliers.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:84%
There are people that always
break away from the tribe,

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's good,
that we have outliers.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
For hundreds of
thousands of years,

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
because all the ice
came all the way down

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.616 align:middle line:84%
to the middle of
Africa, nobody would

00:16:40.616 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
move because they
would call them

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.592 align:middle line:84%
the ice monsters, till finally
some people, outliers, said,

00:16:44.592 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
well, we're going to go
fight the ice monsters.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:90%
And they found ice.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
That's when civilization
began to really move.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
outliers to break away

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
from the norms of the
tribe that are basically

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
the demons of disdain
and the demons of--

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Imagination, even.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: That's right, yes.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying the person
has to be healthy first.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So how much does this
mind-body relationship,

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and as in your book that
you talk about this,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
how much does it
affect our health?

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
You say diabetes is
something that's learned.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: To a
certain degree, you

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.489 align:middle line:90%
have a propensity for diabetes.

00:17:19.489 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
There's a propensity for the
metabolism of the glucose.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
overweight, you're going

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:90%
to be blocking your cells.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:90%
All those things are mechanical.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's a propensity
to be expressed

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:84%
based on what you eat, the
environment that you live,

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
but also the belief
systems that you have.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen quite a bit of
repressed anger in diabetes.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And repressed anger, there's a
lot of endorphin, high levels

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:90%
of endorphin.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, when an animal
is dying of a violent death,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and they do an autopsy,
they'll find endorphins,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.181 align:middle line:84%
very, very high
levels of endorphins,

00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:84%
or a suicide that's
very aggressive,

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and the endorphin
is the anesthetic,

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
so they won't feel the
bite of the lion, the prey.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:90%
So it's an anesthetic.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:10%
So if you're angry, and
you repress your anger,

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:10%
or you're angry
chronically, the only way

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.030 align:middle line:10%
that you can repress it
is with the endorphins.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And endorphins, there's
some research coming out

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that it's showing
that endorphins,

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:84%
when they're high
and chronic, affect

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:90%
the metabolism of glucose.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:90%
So those are things.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.520 align:middle line:10%
But, for example,
righteous anger--

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:10%
my mentor, George Solomon,
who called it psychoimmunology

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:10%
at first and then
psychoimmunology,

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:10%
he called it righteous anger.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.564 align:middle line:10%
Anger in the context when
innocence is being abused,

00:18:38.564 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:10%
that's good for
the immune system.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah-- it is?

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: It is good
for the immune system.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: But if you
take it out of context,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.108 align:middle line:84%
and you become an
angry person, then it's

00:18:45.108 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:90%
bad for the immune system.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK, so
anger could be used

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.319 align:middle line:10%
to help us move into
action, and that releases

00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:10%
the right amount of endorphins.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:10%
But if it's suppressed, it
starts to destroy the system.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, because
it's now chronic.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:90%
You have it within.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And what George Solomon found
was that many of the women

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
that he worked with, to find
out that rheumatoid arthritis is

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
not only the rheumatoid
factor, that it

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
has the psychological component,
he worked with many women.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But I'll give you an example of
what would exemplify the group.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Two sisters, one had
very intense distortions

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and the ravages of the
illness, and the other one

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:90%
was totally perfect.

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Sisters, very close
DNA and so forth,

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:84%
they both have been
sexually abused.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
One, who was with high-intensity
rheumatoid arthritis

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.925 align:middle line:84%
deterioration, would go see
her dad in the nursing home.

00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And her dad would
say, I want you

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.719 align:middle line:84%
to tell me that you
love me, and she would.

00:19:45.719 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And when she would come out,
she would have, of course,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:90%
inflammation, we know now.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:90%
She would be worse.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And then her rheumatologist
would say, no.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:10%
That's just the stress
of seeing your father.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not that.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the inflammation and
the shame that she felt,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:90%
which causes inflammation.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:90%
The other one was fine.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:84%
The other one, he
asked her, what's

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.700 align:middle line:90%
your relationship with your dad?

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I can't
wait for the SOB

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
to die so I can
spit on his grave.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.747 align:middle line:84%
Righteous anger, but she
wasn't an angry person.

00:20:10.747 --> 00:20:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Out of that context,
she was happy and fine.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:84%
But in that situation,
that man was a monster.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a
conservation process

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that we have in our
development of 150,000 years

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
as Homo sapiens, that
it's necessary to be

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.735 align:middle line:84%
angry about some things
to protect innocence.

00:20:27.735 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I understand now
what you're talking about.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, one internalized
it, and one had

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:90%
that type of righteous anger.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.371 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, yes.

00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Speaking
of righteous anger,

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:10%
there are so many drugs that
are pushed on these, quote,

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:10%
"illnesses," like ADD
and high blood pressure

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:10%
and addictions and
other types of things

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:10%
that they call disease.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Is this a matter
of us really being

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:84%
pushed with these types of drugs
by pharmaceutical companies,

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:84%
or are these really
legitimately chemical

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.150 align:middle line:90%
dysfunctions in the body?

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:90%
What's your opinion?

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: There's a
collective belief system--

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceuticals, doctors,
families, teachers--

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:90%
that it's an illness.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know all about the
dopamine and the nucleus

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:90%
accumbens and all of that.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not a deficit, and
it's not a disorder.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It's an abundance
of curiosity that

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
needs to be treated,
needs to be helped.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You mean ADD and ADHD?

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes,
it's not an illness.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:90%
It's an abundance of curiosity.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that they don't have
the attention deficit when

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:84%
they're playing with a video
that they like for hours?

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.689 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the dopamine?

00:21:36.689 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Dopamine definitely
is involved, but it's not that.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it needs to be treated
as an abundance of curiosity.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are schools
that actually do that,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:90%
without medication.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So I would say medication
would be a very low percentage.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a physician, but I have
treated many, many patients,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.235 align:middle line:84%
and working with physicians,
that it's really not necessary

00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
if you have the right treatment
and the right professionals who

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:90%
are working with it.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You did a great
lecture about this.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I want you guys to
check this lecture out

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.260 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Martin Martinez is
talking about, ADD and ADHD.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: We have created
illnesses based on marketing.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:10%
ADHD is not an illness.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.509 align:middle line:10%
ADHD is a marketing scheme.

00:22:20.509 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm a neuropsychologist,
and I can tell you

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.740 align:middle line:10%
that it's not an illness.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:10%
It's novelty learning.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:10%
It's a way of learning
that's different than what

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:10%
you learn in the classrooms.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.765 align:middle line:10%
Addictions are not illnesses.

00:22:31.765 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:10%
They are conduct disorders,
problems with will,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:10%
problems with self-esteem.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.862 align:middle line:10%
Addictions are not illnesses.

00:22:41.862 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:10%
All these other things that
they talk about that, that this

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:10%
is hat's wrong with you and
that's what's wrong with you,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:10%
it's a way--

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:10%
blood pressure 120
over 80 was normal.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:10%
Now they want a larger market
now, so 110 over 70 is better.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:10%
And blood pressure
is not an illness.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:10%
It's only a risk factor.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:10%
Cholesterol is not an illness.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:10%
It's a risk factor.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:10%
When you talk about the
low-density lipoproteins,

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:10%
the "bad" cholesterol,
it's not bad.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:10%
It's necessary.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:10%
It's necessary.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.130 align:middle line:10%
What makes it bad is when you
have pro-inflammatory foods

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:10%
is what makes it bad, not that
the low-density lipoprotein is

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:10%
bad.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:10%
So it's all a marketing scheme.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:10%
You don't blame the physicians.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:10%
You can blame the
pharmaceuticals,

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:10%
and you can blame the
markets that have set up

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:10%
all these standards.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.975 align:middle line:10%
The cholesterol standards
were set up by corporations

00:23:35.975 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle line:10%
and were set up by
members of boards

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:10%
that were paid by corporations
to determine what is normal

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.440 align:middle line:10%
and what is not
normal cholesterol.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.637 align:middle line:10%
There are centenarians,
and I work a lot

00:23:46.637 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:10%
with centenarians,
people who live over 100.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.050 align:middle line:10%
Some of them have
high cholesterol.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.051 align:middle line:10%
And when you ask them,
what do your doctors have

00:23:53.051 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:10%
to say about that, they
say, well, I don't know.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:55.876 align:middle line:10%
They're all dead.

00:23:55.876 --> 00:23:57.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.732 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.732 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell me about
biocognitive theory.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.111 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is that?

00:24:04.111 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ:
Biocognitive is really--

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I had to invent the word.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.070 align:middle line:84%
From biology, all
the things that

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.780 align:middle line:84%
are biological, the immune
system, the nervous system,

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and cognition is the
thoughts, including

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
spirituality,
because spirituality

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.216 align:middle line:90%
requires the cognition.

00:24:17.216 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So both of them
come in together.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:84%
At first, I didn't
bring the culture in.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.019 align:middle line:84%
It was just mind and
body, inseparable.

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Then later, I brought
the culture in,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.280 align:middle line:84%
because I started
looking at other places

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.140 align:middle line:90%
and other countries.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And, for example, in
Asia, the Asian countries

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.347 align:middle line:90%
are collectivist countries.

00:24:34.347 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Here we have an
individualist country.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.560 align:middle line:84%
If I say something to
you, and you're ashamed,

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.040 align:middle line:90%
you are ashamed.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:10%
But if I say
something to an Asian,

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:10%
it's a shaming of the
group or the shaming

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:10%
of the country or the family.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what causes
the inflammation then.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So the immune system is
waiting for the culture

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.589 align:middle line:84%
to tell it how it
needs to respond.

00:24:54.589 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.671 align:middle line:84%
You've brought up suicide
a couple of times here.

00:24:57.671 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned in
the Asian culture

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that if there is a
financial devastation,

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:84%
that the man in
charge of the family,

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.660 align:middle line:84%
there's been a high
incidence of suicide

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.840 align:middle line:84%
amongst that person
that feels responsible.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:10%
And this is a cultural
epidemic that is happening

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.517 align:middle line:10%
within certain areas of Asia.

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about this?

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Yes, yes, because they're
shaming the family.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And the shaming of the family
is the worst that you can do.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Shaming causes inflammation.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is
related to depression.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, they go
into a clinical depression

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.331 align:middle line:90%
and commit suicide.

00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Depression is more
related, I think,

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to inflammatory
kinds of molecules

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:90%
than the serotonin model.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin model is not as
strong as it used to be.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.054 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's inflammatory
from our food supplies?

00:25:47.054 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: A lot are
from our emotions.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.845 align:middle line:84%
Shame is the strongest
indicator of--

00:25:52.845 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Inflammation?

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: --of inflammation.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, people that
live with a lot of shame

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:84%
will have illnesses
that are related to--

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:90%
some are autoimmune.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And now there's some thinking
that inflammation can even

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:90%
trigger autoimmune illnesses.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's that
comes first, of course.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.529 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, yes, because
it's confusing the system.

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is
something to be dealt

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:84%
with when you have a particular
pathology in the tissue

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But inflammation when
there's no need for it,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:84%
it just throws off
the whole system.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.075 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, thus the
autoimmune epidemic.

00:26:26.075 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a
lot of epidemics here.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.811 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is very important.

00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:10%
It's the combination
between the biology

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:10%
and the cognitive
function and the culture

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.780 align:middle line:10%
is where you start to
look for the clues on how

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.750 align:middle line:10%
to heal these things.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you also mentioned--
so back to the suicide thing

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
really quickly-- that there
is a neurotransmitter that's

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
released right before the act of
the person killing themselves?

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: The endorphin.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Endorphin.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, the
endorphin is released in order

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:90%
to reduce the pain.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:90%
It's an automatic process.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
The prey, for example, there's
a deer, and there's a lion.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:84%
The prey after a
while will give up,

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and you notice they'll
turn up like this.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And the lion bites.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.976 align:middle line:84%
And the body, automatically
from many, many hundreds

00:27:10.976 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of years, will
shoot the endorphin out

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.560 align:middle line:90%
in order to reduce the pain.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's what happens
also with anger.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you know you're
going to shoot yourself,

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot of fear,
even though you know

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:24.470 align:middle line:90%
you're going to shoot yourself.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:25.803 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it's a snap, right.

00:27:25.803 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So you're
going to have endorphins.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
prevent it is my question.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: The suicide?

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
about suicide is

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.911 align:middle line:84%
that worthiness is a real
important component of suicide.

00:27:37.911 --> 00:27:40.160 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that
I talked about that I wrote

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:10%
an article about, Bourdain,
who was one of my heroes,

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:10%
what happens is
that if you don't--

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.360 align:middle line:10%
and it's not that he
didn't feel worthy.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.855 align:middle line:10%
But you get to a point where
you're not being self-caring.

00:27:55.855 --> 00:27:57.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
to kill yourself,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.860 align:middle line:90%
you're not self-caring.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.318 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
techniques that I use

00:27:59.318 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
is to let people know
that you love them.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Call somebody that you know.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And you tell them
that you love them,

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:84%
while you don't have the
ability to love yourself.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And love has a
reciprocal component,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:84%
so it begins to bring
the person back.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:90%
But you have to practice this.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.120 align:middle line:84%
If you have suicidal tendency,
you have to practice.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.745 align:middle line:84%
Let me call such and
such and tell them

00:28:16.745 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:84%
that I love them,
not to say goodbye,

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.081 align:middle line:84%
but just to let them
know that I love them.

00:28:20.081 --> 00:28:24.419 align:middle line:84%
That gradually, indirectly,
brings back the self-caring so

00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:26.085 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want
to destroy yourself.

00:28:26.085 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm overs--

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Doing that as a
practice is important.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: As a practice, yes.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You wrote an article
in the "Huff Post" about this--

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --which is great.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So the act of calling
someone and telling them

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:90%
that you love them, what else?

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.755 align:middle line:84%
What else could help
with something like that?

00:28:41.755 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well,
the first thing

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.267 align:middle line:84%
is-- there was a study,
the biggest study that's

00:28:45.267 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:90%
ever been done at Harvard.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.671 align:middle line:10%
77 years they've
been studying this.

00:28:48.671 --> 00:28:49.920 align:middle line:10%
And they looked at everything.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:10%
They looked at blood pressure.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:10%
And the factor that they
found that kept the person

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.850 align:middle line:10%
within a certain level of
mental health and longevity

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:10%
was that that person had
someone that they could

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.280 align:middle line:10%
count on when they needed them.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Powerful factor.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 77 years, hmm.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, and
sometimes people,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:90%
whether it's true or not--

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:84%
if they're delusional,
of course, then there's

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.410 align:middle line:90%
no reasoning there.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes,
people get to a point

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that they really don't think
that anybody loves them.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And you would ask, well,
why, these people that

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:28.624 align:middle line:84%
are so well known, that are
loved all over the world,

00:29:28.624 --> 00:29:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and they go back to their
hotel, and they kill themselves?

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That have
brands about positivity

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.405 align:middle line:84%
and have lifestyles
that one would want.

00:29:35.405 --> 00:29:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And
one of the things

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.946 align:middle line:84%
that I've found in working
with some of these people

00:29:38.946 --> 00:29:41.610 align:middle line:84%
is that let's say
you have a concert.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And 50,000 people go to a
concert, and you feel great.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Your adrenaline is going.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.145 align:middle line:84%
It's fine, and you know
those people love you.

00:29:47.145 --> 00:29:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Then you go back to your
private hotel by yourself.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't have anybody
to share it with,

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.712 align:middle line:84%
anybody that means
something to you.

00:29:54.712 --> 00:29:56.920 align:middle line:84%
It's always good to travel
with people that love you.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's
true, or at least

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:90%
have them close by on the phone.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Have them
close by or call them.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you think
about the term mental illness?

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Mental illness, we
hear this all the time,

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and a lot is attributed
to mental illness.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:90%
So we have to solve mental--

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.544 align:middle line:90%
what do you feel about it?

00:30:09.544 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: There's no such
thing as mental illness.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:84%
There's mind-body illness,
but there's no illness

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't affect the body.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.829 align:middle line:84%
And there's no illness
that doesn't affect

00:30:18.829 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:90%
the mind or the cognition.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And in conventional
medicine, if we

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.974 align:middle line:84%
can't find anything
clinically wrong

00:30:26.974 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and you have some symptoms, then
you need to see a psychiatrist.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, OK.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And by the way,
many of these people that commit

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:90%
suicide are not mentally ill--

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, yeah.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: --or
not even depressed.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's an existential
process that's going on there.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Meaning?

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.424 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Meaning
the meaning of life,

00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of themselves, the
meaning of what am I doing.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they
feel that they've

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:48.559 align:middle line:90%
done everything possible.

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of these people
have done things

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't
do in 10 lives.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing
is, because they're

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.320 align:middle line:84%
living on this adrenaline,
OK, so what's my next high?

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.468 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: And they give up.

00:30:59.468 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, I fear that
sometimes around our younger

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:84%
culture that's so addicted
to the dopamine hits

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.590 align:middle line:84%
from the gaming
and the technology

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that
there is not going

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to be enough in
their 40s, 50s, 60s,

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate that level
of instant gratification.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.364 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what's going to happen
culturally to this generation.

00:31:21.364 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, it's very
interesting because what

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.785 align:middle line:84%
I call the i-self that
we're creating, that we text

00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and everything-- if I
look at you, and I smile,

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and you smile back, we'll
have oxytocin and endorphins

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.750 align:middle line:90%
and other things coming out.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:39.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing a video, or
if you're talking to somebody,

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and you see the face,
and they're smiling,

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:90%
there's no oxytocin.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:84%
The immune system can
tell the difference,

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:90%
and the endocrine system.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.872 align:middle line:84%
So you can't fool mother
nature, as they say.

00:31:48.872 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting, so you
have to have more personal face

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, face time.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not on FaceTime here.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Not on FaceTime,
but the real, exactly.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so a smile on
a camera through FaceTime

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.210 align:middle line:90%
isn't the same thing?

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.143 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It doesn't
share the oxytocin?

00:32:03.143 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: No, and it
might be the mirror neurons.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:90%
They're beginning to study that.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.881 align:middle line:10%
But, for example,
many people can see--

00:32:11.881 --> 00:32:13.380 align:middle line:10%
you're looking at
a television show,

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:10%
and you can tell if it's
live or if it's not.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.197 align:middle line:90%
There's some sense.

00:32:17.197 --> 00:32:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Energy, yes.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Something happens
out of the same thing here.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.915 align:middle line:90%
And it's been tested.

00:32:20.915 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they do the FaceTime,
and it doesn't happen.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Because
it's an i-self.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.626 align:middle line:90%
It's not self.

00:32:29.626 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.706 align:middle line:90%
So that screen really limits--

00:32:33.706 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, yes.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --neurotransmitters?

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, and
the interesting thing

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:90%
is that you're having fun.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:45.270 align:middle line:84%
You feel good about it, but
it's not responding to the way

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.770 align:middle line:90%
that it should.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.526 align:middle line:84%
And maybe another 10,000
years, maybe the immune system

00:32:50.526 --> 00:32:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and nervous system
will adjust to that.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:90%
But right now, it hasn't.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:90%
I hope it doesn't.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, I mean,
what if you have friends

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.443 align:middle line:10%
that you can't maybe see, or are
in other states and so forth,

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:01.170 align:middle line:10%
that you can still talk
to people on the street

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.565 align:middle line:10%
or have conversations
with people in line

00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:04.440 align:middle line:10%
at the grocery store?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Would that give you the
same amount of connection?

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: It helps, yes.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does help.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: You have to have
the little tribe, the community.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And rituals are really,
really important--

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ:
--especially when you're

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:84%
ending a relationship,
when you've

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:90%
been with unrequited love.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.481 align:middle line:90%
Someone no longer loves you.

00:33:18.481 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't go look
for somebody else.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.146 align:middle line:90%
You don't go look for drugs.

00:33:21.146 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:90%
You don't go look for porno.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:84%
You look for rituals,
self-caring rituals,

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:84%
finding a little restaurant
where they treat you well,

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
preparing a meal for yourself,
going for a walk to commune

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds really very
trite and very magical,

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:90%
but it's true.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.456 align:middle line:84%
You have immunological changes
when you go into the rituals.

00:33:41.456 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:90%
We're built that way.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.062 align:middle line:90%
It's in our DNA to have rituals.

00:33:45.062 --> 00:33:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can see that.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:84%
But what's the difference
between a ritual and a routine?

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: The
routine is something

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:84%
you do for a function, to
take a shower to smell good,

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:90%
stay clean.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.107 align:middle line:84%
A ritual is something
that you venerate.

00:33:56.107 --> 00:33:56.940 align:middle line:90%
You bring it higher.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.190 align:middle line:84%
You go for a walk to
commune with nature

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.770 align:middle line:84%
or you have meals with a
family without television.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.117 align:middle line:90%
Those are the rituals.

00:34:03.117 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That have meaning.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: That have meaning,
even a funeral is a ritual.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.200 align:middle line:90%
A wedding is a ritual.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.179 align:middle line:90%
A birthdays is a ritual.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing
is to eat with family

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.520 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of intervention
with the digital world.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.912 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A lost art, but it
does have a lot of benefits.

00:34:20.912 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they've done a lot of
studies on the family dinner.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Oh, yes,
very much, very much.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.418 align:middle line:84%
There was a study actually
that looked at alcoholics.

00:34:27.418 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you have parents
who are alcoholics,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.310 align:middle line:90%
your propensity is very high.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at the
outliers, the ones who

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.484 align:middle line:84%
didn't become
alcoholics, although they

00:34:34.484 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:84%
had alcoholic parents,
and drank socially.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And they found
that the factor was

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.409 align:middle line:84%
that although the
parents were alcoholics,

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:41.950 align:middle line:84%
they would still
break bread together

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:90%
without any television.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:84%
They would still
have the dinners,

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:84%
even though they may
have been a little drunk.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:49.679 align:middle line:90%
But they still had the dinners.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.949 align:middle line:84%
It has a cohesive quality
to it that's very important.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is interesting.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.080 align:middle line:90%
You just described my life.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.222 align:middle line:84%
My father came back from
Vietnam with, you know,

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:84%
horrible issues with alcohol
because he was anaesthetising.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: PTSD?

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:10%
And because of his
exposure to Agent Orange

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:10%
and had all these chemical
issues, and yet my mom

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.556 align:middle line:10%
still tried to keep it together
with these horrible crockpot

00:35:13.556 --> 00:35:14.430 align:middle line:10%
meals she would make.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:90%
But they were still--

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: But you
kept it cohesive,

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.964 align:middle line:84%
even though it
wasn't the greatest.

00:35:19.964 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I
didn't wind up being

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:84%
an alcoholic, thank
God, probably because

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:84%
of those horrible
crockpot meals.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: That's right.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:27.170 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It just reduces the intensity of
whatever pathology is going on.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm, that's
very interesting.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.360 align:middle line:10%
It's so fascinating that you're
able to study all of this

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.800 align:middle line:10%
and learn all of this.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you learn,
it helps not sabotage or repeat

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:84%
these different
types of patterns.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And it's
a science of hope,

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.870 align:middle line:90%
but with good evidence.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A science of
hope, I love that.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: You're not
sentenced to an illness.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.969 align:middle line:84%
You're not sentenced
to live your life

00:35:54.969 --> 00:35:57.510 align:middle line:84%
like your parents did, but you
have to do something about it.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.986 align:middle line:90%
It's not just in your head.

00:35:59.986 --> 00:36:01.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not just affirmations.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:84%
It's actually living it
and creating evidence.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's actually a clip
here, talking about rituals.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.565 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Martinez is going
to talk about that.

00:36:09.565 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: I went to Cuba.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:84%
They have quite a few
centenarians there.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.700 align:middle line:10%
And I interviewed this lady.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.750 align:middle line:10%
And I asked her,
so what do you--

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.540 align:middle line:10%
instead of biasing
it, I was doing a kind

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:10%
of ethnographic kind of thing.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.650 align:middle line:10%
I said, what do you do
on a regular basis that

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:10%
has meaning for you?

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.010 align:middle line:10%
It's another way of saying,
do you have a ritual?

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:10%
And she said, oh, yes.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.009 align:middle line:10%
I have a shot of rum
before I go to sleep.

00:36:30.009 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, oh, it's
got to be the Cuban

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.080 align:middle line:10%
Bacardi or the Cuban rum.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to another one,
and he said, I have a cigar.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.580 align:middle line:10%
Oh, it must be the Cuban--

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.840 align:middle line:10%
it's the ritual.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:10%
They all have rituals.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:10%
So I would suggest that one of
the causes of health that you

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:10%
can start is create a ritual.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:10%
Elevate it to a level
where you can actually

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.096 align:middle line:10%
have a devotional component
to it, that it's important.

00:36:51.096 --> 00:36:52.470 align:middle line:10%
And you will see
how things begin

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:10%
to change to a certain degree.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.500 align:middle line:10%
The other thing about
the causes of health

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.110 align:middle line:10%
is that, for at
least 150,000 years,

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.940 align:middle line:10%
we've been refining the system.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:10%
The immune system is much
more sophisticated now

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.690 align:middle line:10%
than it was a million years ago.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:08.650 align:middle line:10%
There were no T cells
a million years ago.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:10%
Now we have T cells.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:10%
So you don't want to
live back in the caves.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to
go back to nature,

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.090 align:middle line:10%
because you would live
31 years in those days.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:21.110 align:middle line:10%
And there was no sanitary paper
or toothbrushes and paste.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.487 align:middle line:10%
So you were not as attractive,
although in those days,

00:37:24.487 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:10%
that was attractive.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.580 align:middle line:10%


00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.040 align:middle line:10%
So see how I get a little
Darwinian, too, sometimes?

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.670 align:middle line:10%
So, anyway, we've been
defining our tools.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:42.110 align:middle line:10%
And in at least 150,000
years, it's contextual.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:44.780 align:middle line:10%
The best tool to
be around children

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:10%
is the archetype of the
father or the mother.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the best.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:49.828 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right,
so in that clip,

00:37:49.828 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:90%
you talked about archetypes.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Archetypes, you
can look at them as tools.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
With 150,000 years
of Homo sapiens,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.430 align:middle line:90%
there's a trial and error.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, this tool works well here.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work well there.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And your biology
will adjust to that.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, it works here.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:90%
You get a hammer.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to use
a hammer for a screw.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to hammer with
the handle of a screwdriver.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
with the archetypes?

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.100 align:middle line:90%
You're the father.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.100 align:middle line:84%
You come home to children,
and you're the lover.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not the right archetype.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.460 align:middle line:84%
After hundreds of
thousands of years,

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.160 align:middle line:84%
the best archetype for
the man with the children

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is the father, with
the woman, the mother.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.127 align:middle line:84%
And especially with
CEOs, visionary,

00:38:35.127 --> 00:38:37.460 align:middle line:84%
but when you get home, you
don't want to be a visionary.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.740 align:middle line:84%
You want to be a
father or a partner,

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:90%
or a mother or a partner.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
that I work with CEOs.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:48.080 align:middle line:84%
In many of these major
companies, 75% of them

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.241 align:middle line:90%
have gastrointestinal problems.

00:38:50.241 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Hmm, because
they come home,

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:90%
and they're still the CEO?

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they're
not the partner?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: They're
not the partner.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And it's like
using this the screwdriver.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.060 align:middle line:90%
It'll break.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: The system is set up
for this context, that context.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:90%
If you break it--

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.951 align:middle line:84%
that's what happened
with Steve Jobs.

00:39:04.951 --> 00:39:07.850 align:middle line:84%
He was a visionary, my hero,
but he couldn't break from that.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.174 align:middle line:84%
He just didn't know
how to break from it.

00:39:10.174 --> 00:39:11.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Adapt to life.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.631 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, he
used Zen Buddhism

00:39:12.631 --> 00:39:16.220 align:middle line:10%
for the Apple products, but
not for himself as much.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hmm.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So people take their
work home with them,

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:84%
or they stay in the
same role in that way.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
What is the ideal archetype
for when you are growing up?

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to have
as the mother, the father?

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.097 align:middle line:84%
And what about same-sex
couples and things like that?

00:39:33.097 --> 00:39:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Do they take on different roles?

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.346 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, I think so.

00:39:36.346 --> 00:39:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Even same-sex couples can
have more, like, the fatherly

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and the motherly in the
sense of teaching ways.

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:46.047 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to
be your child's friend.

00:39:46.047 --> 00:39:47.380 align:middle line:90%
The archetype of the friend, no.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.810 align:middle line:84%
You want to have a
father who's friendly

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and a mother who's
friendly, but not the friend

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.210 align:middle line:84%
only, because they need a
mother, not just a friend.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's very, very important.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Or they need a
father or a figure

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.207 align:middle line:84%
that they can see that
this person is my friend,

00:40:01.207 --> 00:40:02.290 align:middle line:90%
but is not just my friend.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I can go to them and ask
more than I ask my friends.

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can still be
friends with your children?

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, of course.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.911 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of course, and
sometimes be best friends,

00:40:08.911 --> 00:40:11.920 align:middle line:84%
but you maintain the
role as the parent

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.525 align:middle line:90%
as the predominant relationship.

00:40:13.525 --> 00:40:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.474 align:middle line:84%
I'm your father, and
I'm your best friend.

00:40:16.474 --> 00:40:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But when I need
to be your father,

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.290 align:middle line:84%
then I shoot out of the best
friend, and I'm your father.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.070 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't do this.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.783 align:middle line:90%
But you're my best friend.

00:40:22.783 --> 00:40:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, but I'm your father.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.496 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, so let's
talk a little bit

00:40:25.496 --> 00:40:32.350 align:middle line:84%
about this self-compassion
and over-caring for others.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:84%
This is such an
interesting topic

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that you cover on how we can
be over-caring for people,

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:45.070 align:middle line:84%
people-pleasing, and to the
point where we are not taking

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.707 align:middle line:90%
care of ourselves any longer.

00:40:46.707 --> 00:40:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, if you
divide all the illnesses,

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I think you can divide
all the illnesses

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.720 align:middle line:84%
into under-immunity,
hyper or over-immunity,

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.370 align:middle line:90%
and auto-immunity.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So the immune system is
not working strong enough.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.272 align:middle line:84%
It's self-destroying
or working too much.

00:41:02.272 --> 00:41:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Two different things.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not strong enough
or destroying itself.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Or destroying
it, or, for example,

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.670 align:middle line:84%
under-immunity, there's a
correlation, not a cause,

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:84%
a correlation, with
infections, cancer,

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:18.240 align:middle line:84%
things that the immune
system can't take care of.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Autoimmune, of course, is
related to the inflammation,

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.510 align:middle line:90%
shaming, and things like that.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you have MS, and
you have rheumatoid arthritis

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.280 align:middle line:90%
and fibromyalgia.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Hyperimmunity is
really, for example,

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.070 align:middle line:90%
allergies are hyperimmunity.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Overreacting, the immune
system is overreacting

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.190 align:middle line:84%
to something that is
like a pathogen that

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.590 align:middle line:84%
is not there, or not
necessarily there.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can retrain
yourself out of any kind

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:84%
of allergy, or most allergies,
with professional help.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, really?

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:54.217 align:middle line:84%
So going back to your
question on the--

00:41:54.217 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Over-caring.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Sometimes, I
go over, but I come back.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, that
makes sense, though.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It's an answer to my
question, but go ahead.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So hat happens
with the caretakers

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.170 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the
causes of health

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:08.250 align:middle line:84%
is having good
self-caring boundaries.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:09.326 align:middle line:90%
You don't have that.

00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:10.700 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
that you're going

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.750 align:middle line:90%
to have an under-immunity.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:84%
You're doing and doing
and doing and doing,

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and you're not replenishing.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.570 align:middle line:84%
You're not taking
care of yourself.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.765 align:middle line:90%
My aunt died of colon cancer.

00:42:20.765 --> 00:42:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't what caused
it, but her personality

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:90%
was that way.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.650 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want
to upset anybody.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I took her to the
hospital, she was dying.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.297 align:middle line:90%
She called me out of her room.

00:42:30.297 --> 00:42:31.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's the matter?

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK?

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Ask the ambulance driver
if he's had dinner.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.380 align:middle line:90%
And she's dying.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And you would say, this is
a saint, and that's good.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.450 align:middle line:84%
But wait till you
die to be canonized.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Don't become a saint
when you're alive.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Have limits.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.020 align:middle line:90%
You have empathy fatigue.

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.910 align:middle line:84%
It looks just like
burnout, but it's not.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.370 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, this is very
common amongst caregivers

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:10%
in our Baby Boomer
generation who are caring now

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.050 align:middle line:10%
for their spouses or
loved ones or adult

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.850 align:middle line:10%
children who are caring for
aging parents that are ill.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:08.692 align:middle line:84%
It can be very fatiguing
on the entire situation.

00:43:08.692 --> 00:43:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And they always say, oh,
take care of yourself.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Do something for yourself,
but you can't when

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:90%
your parent is dying.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: It's very difficult.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, yes, and
you have to find some help.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
people that help you.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.077 align:middle line:84%
And also you feel guilty
for feeling resentment.

00:43:20.077 --> 00:43:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It feels so insensitive.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.285 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So it's
a bad situation.

00:43:24.285 --> 00:43:26.101 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Give us some
solutions, Dr. Mario.

00:43:26.101 --> 00:43:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well,
I think number one

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is to be aware that
that's happening

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and to remember this
little example that I

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.960 align:middle line:90%
use when you're flying.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And they tell you
about the mask.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:90%
When does the pressure change?

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.586 align:middle line:84%
You breathe first and then
the child or the disabled,

00:43:44.586 --> 00:43:46.710 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise you pass
out, and you can't help.

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the same thing.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.362 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
to do is if you

00:43:49.362 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:84%
don't take care of
yourself, you're

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.194 align:middle line:84%
not going to be
able to take care

00:43:52.194 --> 00:43:53.610 align:middle line:90%
of that person, number one.

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:56.825 align:middle line:84%
And number two is
that in many cases,

00:43:56.825 --> 00:43:58.950 align:middle line:84%
people in those situations
are martyrs in the sense

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:90%
that I can do it all.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.030 align:middle line:90%
They don't ask for help.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've had patients who tell
me, I'm taking care of my mom.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.009 align:middle line:84%
She's all alone, and I
got to take care of--

00:44:09.009 --> 00:44:10.050 align:middle line:90%
do you have any siblings?

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there are six of us.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Can they help?

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.200 align:middle line:90%
No, no, they can't.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.000 align:middle line:90%
They're very busy.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, those are examples of the
martyr, that I can do it all,

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.500 align:middle line:90%
and I don't need anybody.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.959 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
empathy fatigue,

00:44:20.959 --> 00:44:22.458 align:middle line:84%
and they have all
kinds of problems.

00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:23.280 align:middle line:90%
And they get sick.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they even
die before the person

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:25.470 align:middle line:90%
they're taking care of.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, you hear
about this all the time.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.835 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I mean, it begs
the question, though.

00:44:29.835 --> 00:44:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Why is our older
generation so ill?

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we see it
with health care.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:37.050 align:middle line:90%
We see the burden on society.

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Why are so many people so ill,
where they drain their savings

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.011 align:middle line:90%
in end-of-life care?

00:44:46.011 --> 00:44:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well, the way I
look at it is with centenarians.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.360 align:middle line:84%
My idea is that
good science looks

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.060 align:middle line:84%
at what works and then
creates theories about it,

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.530 align:middle line:90%
not what doesn't work.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at
centenarians, hundreds of them,

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:04.030 align:middle line:84%
for years, over 20 years, I
find that genetics is about 20%.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.240 align:middle line:84%
How they live and
the environments

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.040 align:middle line:90%
that they live in--

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is the rest?

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: --is really
the major factor.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are some
other traits or traditions

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that these centenarians
do that have

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:21.320 align:middle line:84%
kept them so healthy at
a very, very old age?

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: What my mentor
called healthy narcissism.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.135 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: They
love themselves.

00:45:26.135 --> 00:45:27.910 align:middle line:90%
They think everybody loves them.

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And the system can't
tell the difference

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:30.910 align:middle line:90%
whether you believe it or not.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at the opposite.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.859 align:middle line:84%
All these people that are
so famous, rock stars,

00:45:34.859 --> 00:45:36.400 align:middle line:84%
they have all these
people love them.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.316 align:middle line:90%
They don't believe it.

00:45:37.316 --> 00:45:38.620 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I went to Cuba to
interview a centenarian,

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:43.915 align:middle line:84%
and they had a little
cocktail party for him later.

00:45:43.915 --> 00:45:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
women there and some men.

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And he walks up to
me, and he says,

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.140 align:middle line:84%
have you noticed how these
women are looking at me?

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.280 align:middle line:90%
They love me.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
healthy narcissism.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.130 align:middle line:84%
He says, but have you noticed
how beautiful they are?

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:59.331 align:middle line:84%
Inclusive narcissism,
that's the difference.

00:45:59.331 --> 00:46:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's not a
dirty old man thing.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.396 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No, no, no.

00:46:02.396 --> 00:46:04.270 align:middle line:84%
The narcissist would
say, since they love me,

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to
go take advantage.

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.200 align:middle line:84%
He was saying, let me
share my-- they love me.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Look how beautiful they are.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.560 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.680 align:middle line:90%
It's inclusive.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the causes of health.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.470 align:middle line:90%
They have that.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.590 align:middle line:84%
What are we taught
in our society?

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.087 align:middle line:84%
Pseudo-humbleness, the little
girl goes to the mother

00:46:20.087 --> 00:46:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and says, Mommy,
look how pretty I am.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.380 align:middle line:84%
No, no, darling,
you don't say that.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.640 align:middle line:90%
You don't say you're pretty.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.800 align:middle line:84%
You wait till they tell
you, and then you deny it.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So then how can you buy
anything good about yourself?

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:84%
In Uruguay, where I was
living, they kid around,

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.540 align:middle line:90%
but I don't think they do it.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.456 align:middle line:90%
It's a cultural thing.

00:46:35.456 --> 00:46:39.605 align:middle line:10%
They say, we forgive
everything except success.

00:46:39.605 --> 00:46:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're number one is
suicide in South America.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Because of that--

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We don't
forgive success.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: We don't
forgive success.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend out
there who bought a car,

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.441 align:middle line:90%
and he bought a gray car.

00:46:48.441 --> 00:46:52.211 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want it to be gray
so people won't notice it.

00:46:52.211 --> 00:46:54.210 align:middle line:84%
If you do really well,
then they bring you down.

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can't-- the Scandinavians
have a problem with that, too,

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.082 align:middle line:84%
that everybody
should be the same.

00:47:00.082 --> 00:47:01.290 align:middle line:90%
In fact, you're not the same.

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:04.510 align:middle line:84%
You're worse than
everybody else.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with
corporations in Scandinavia

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and different countries,
I have to teach

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:10.483 align:middle line:84%
them to come out of
that culture and come up

00:47:10.483 --> 00:47:12.480 align:middle line:90%
with a hybrid leadership.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And maybe raise
the entire culture--

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:14.595 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:47:14.595 --> 00:47:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --if it's
a small enough one

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.310 align:middle line:90%
that you could start to raise.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen that work?

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.504 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, yes, yes,
because what we do is we

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.177 align:middle line:84%
say we want equality
of excellence.

00:47:22.177 --> 00:47:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, that would be good.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: They still
stay equal, but excellent.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That would be very good.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So you
respect the culture,

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.850 align:middle line:90%
but you kind of enhance the--

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you've seen it work.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But what would you
suggest as an exercise

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to maybe you're wanting to
raise your financial ceiling,

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.626 align:middle line:90%
your healthy abundance level?

00:47:41.626 --> 00:47:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Can you teach us something?

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:45.900 align:middle line:84%
First, look at who
taught you not abundance.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Who taught you deprivation,
not by saying it,

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.040 align:middle line:90%
but by watching it?

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Deprivation in the
house, or who taught

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:56.690 align:middle line:90%
you to save for a rainy day?

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.090 align:middle line:84%
You're telling the brain,
save for a rainy day.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:47:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All of those
colloquialisms.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:00.890 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: So you're
saving for a rainy day.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:03.020 align:middle line:10%
And when you save it,
the rainy day comes.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:03.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all set up.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Money doesn't
grow on trees.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Money doesn't grow
on trees, all those things.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's a deprivation
model, so you learn that.

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yikes.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.893 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And then you look
at the outliers who didn't

00:48:11.893 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:90%
buy that within the pale.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:90%
You begin to imitate them.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to affirm
things like, for example, I

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:21.530 align:middle line:90%
can become wealthy.

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But then affirmation
alone doesn't work.

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.480 align:middle line:90%
You pay attention to the body.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.688 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel tense
because the body says, no.

00:48:27.688 --> 00:48:28.790 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't.

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Then go back to a memory.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.460 align:middle line:90%
They're all archived.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And you say, when
did I feel abundant?

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.830 align:middle line:10%
When did I make a little
money that I felt abundant?

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.180 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel?

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.606 align:middle line:84%
Then you have an archive
of evidence of success.

00:48:41.606 --> 00:48:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Then for the rest
of the day, you

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.500 align:middle line:84%
do things that are
compatible with you

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.520 align:middle line:84%
having abundance in your life,
small things, little things.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see how you
start breaking some

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:54.290 align:middle line:90%
of the old scripts that say--

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a patient
who I saw him once.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:03.834 align:middle line:84%
And he was making about $300,000
a year, and he owed $350.

00:49:03.834 --> 00:49:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't help him very much.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.124 align:middle line:90%
He didn't see me very long.

00:49:06.124 --> 00:49:07.350 align:middle line:90%
I saw him 10 years later.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.460 align:middle line:84%
He was making $800,000,
and he owed $900,000.

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So you work to pay bills
or you work to survive.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And those models need to
be broken out of the pale.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.727 align:middle line:84%
You've got to live
beyond the pale.

00:49:19.727 --> 00:49:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And then allow the
culture to criticize you.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Give them permission
to not like you.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're saying be
OK with feeling uncomfortable

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:31.385 align:middle line:84%
and be OK with
breaking the patterns.

00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, but
also finding evidence

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:35.450 align:middle line:90%
that you are that.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:38.570 align:middle line:84%
If you say I'm a good person,
and you don't have evidence,

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:41.174 align:middle line:84%
or your evidence evidence
is you're not a good person,

00:49:41.174 --> 00:49:42.590 align:middle line:84%
affirmations aren't
going to work.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:44.150 align:middle line:90%
They will make you tense.

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you say, when
was I good in my life--

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.220 align:middle line:84%
oh, I remember 10
years ago, I did this.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Bring the memory
back and embody it.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Embodying is really important.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.560 align:middle line:90%
And then make a commitment.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.930 align:middle line:84%
What can I do today
to have evidence

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:57.940 align:middle line:90%
that I'm a good person?

00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.689 align:middle line:84%
See, neural maps don't
change in the brain

00:49:59.689 --> 00:50:00.920 align:middle line:90%
unless you give it evidence.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Cognition alone won't change it.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.677 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's go
back to the model of debt.

00:50:04.677 --> 00:50:06.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, you look
at society, and you

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:10.300 align:middle line:84%
look at how much we are
marketed to be in debt.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: To live beyond
your means, the American way.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, so then
you're going to have a problem.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, so how do you
break that cultural norm,

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:20.229 align:middle line:90%
that societal norm?

00:50:20.229 --> 00:50:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: By looking at
the things that really matter

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.603 align:middle line:90%
in your life, the rituals.

00:50:23.603 --> 00:50:27.560 align:middle line:84%
The rituals, most
of them are free.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I went through a
bankruptcy many years ago,

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and I was accumulating
everything, including love.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And then when I realized that
the things that matter in life

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.310 align:middle line:84%
are not that
important, it was over.

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to achieve
for those things anymore.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I would achieve for
quality of life.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And everything came
back, but differently.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't buy $100,000
paintings anymore.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.587 align:middle line:84%
I don't drive a Porsche anymore
because I don't need to.

00:50:51.587 --> 00:50:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't need to.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you said
you were acquiring love.

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you mean?

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Friends, and I
would take them out to dinner,

00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:59.661 align:middle line:90%
and I would pay for everything.

00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And all those friends, when I
lost all the money, were gone.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.310 align:middle line:90%
So those are not friends.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Those are people
that you're buying.

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And now how do you live?

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Very comfortably.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I cook quite a bit.

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I cook by myself, I
have candles, Gregorian music,

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.930 align:middle line:90%
because here's another thing.

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:23.305 align:middle line:84%
People will say,
oh, just for me?

00:51:23.305 --> 00:51:24.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to cook for me.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:26.104 align:middle line:90%
I'll just have something quick.

00:51:26.104 --> 00:51:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Would you do it
for somebody else?

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, I would,
but not for me.

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.900 align:middle line:84%
You go to a restaurant,
and you say one.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Only one?

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, how many do you want?

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And they say, no problem.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Is there a problem?

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.690 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's already
set up that way.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So the individual is
not valued as much

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.530 align:middle line:84%
as a group in that
sense, even though we

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.600 align:middle line:90%
have an individualist culture.

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Why would somebody
say, only one?

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:51.850 align:middle line:84%
They try to put you at the
bar or give you a bad table.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So how can you
feel good if that's

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.410 align:middle line:90%
how the culture treats you?

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:57.285 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, no, that
makes a lot of sense,

00:51:57.285 --> 00:51:58.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's based on
the tribe again.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, on the tribe.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:51:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where's your tribe?

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Where's your tribe?

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah, that's right.

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you try to
individuate from the tribe,

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.220 align:middle line:84%
you have to have all of
these great rituals in place.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.060 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love the idea
of cooking for yourself

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:08.820 align:middle line:90%
and playing the music.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I cook for myself when I
sit in front of my computer.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No, no, no i-self.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:18.870 align:middle line:84%
It is so tempting because
it's so entertaining.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:21.840 align:middle line:84%
But you'll find that when you
begin to entertain yourself,

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.772 align:middle line:84%
that you really are a
very interesting person.

00:52:23.772 --> 00:52:25.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So do you
go to the airport

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.563 align:middle line:10%
and sit and wait for your plane?

00:52:26.563 --> 00:52:28.130 align:middle line:10%
Do you play on your phone?

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No.

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Didn't think so.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: No, now I'm writing.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now you're writing.

00:52:32.205 --> 00:52:33.727 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: I'm
writing a new book.

00:52:33.727 --> 00:52:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good one.

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How much do you think
laughter keeps us young?

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.403 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Oh, it's
really important.

00:52:39.403 --> 00:52:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Laughter, it's actually a
dilator, a vascular dilator.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Some cardiologists
are working with laughter now.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.850 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese use
laughter therapeutically.

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Not only, I'm not
saying just laughter

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.636 align:middle line:90%
if you have a heart problem.

00:52:50.636 --> 00:52:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's an enhancer
because it's a dilator.

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And you have all
kinds of good hormones

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that are released, and
the oxytocin again.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Why would you have a dilation
of the cardiovascular system

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:03.870 align:middle line:90%
when you're laughing?

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:05.990 align:middle line:84%
You need more, if
it's a belly laughter.

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Now this is called
the Duchenne laughter.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.650 align:middle line:84%
The real laughter is
the one that you get--

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:17.710 align:middle line:84%
the social laughter, it's the
laughter from here, nothing

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:18.510 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:20.610 align:middle line:84%
When you hear the laughter
that's contagious, that's good.

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:22.380 align:middle line:84%
When you hear the laughter
that's almost annoying,

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.470 align:middle line:90%
it's social laughter.

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, but when you
hear the belly laugh of someone,

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.290 align:middle line:84%
you look, and you
laugh because of it.

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen the laughing
video-- laughter therapy?

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.900 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEZ: It's contagious.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, it's
very contagious.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.079 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: It's like yawning.

00:53:33.079 --> 00:53:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how much does humor
play a role in our healing,

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.340 align:middle line:90%
in our health?

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Well,
centenarians have a great way

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:40.360 align:middle line:90%
to deal with it.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.520 align:middle line:84%
First, it dilates your
cardiovascular system.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.440 align:middle line:90%
But they laugh at themselves.

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.340 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability
to laugh at themselves.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.300 align:middle line:84%
When something happens,
if they make a mistake,

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.590 align:middle line:84%
they laugh at themselves
because they made a mistake.

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But they also see
humor in things

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
even see the humor.

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And they function in a way
where when they wake up

00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:06.000 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, they're
trying to figure out

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.520 align:middle line:84%
what's going to be funny
for them in their lives.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like they anticipate
things to be doing well.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And they don't take
themselves very seriously.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:15.651 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

00:54:15.651 --> 00:54:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a biggie.

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: They don't take
themselves very seriously.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are very
wealthy and very well known

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:22.590 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And Oscar Niemeyer,
the architect

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.690 align:middle line:84%
who designed Brasilia, he
died at 107, I believe.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And he would always have fun.

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.710 align:middle line:90%
But they broke bread.

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.970 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing, when
you're breaking bread,

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:37.770 align:middle line:90%
is to have fun.

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're laughing, yeah.

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: You're laughing
and having a good time

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and remembering.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Another thing, learning
how to mourn without dying,

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.240 align:middle line:90%
very important.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: What that means
is that many centenarians lose

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.550 align:middle line:90%
their children.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:51.900 align:middle line:90%
They lose their families.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
is they celebrate

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:55.380 align:middle line:90%
having known the person.

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:58.579 align:middle line:84%
That's how they mourn,
having known the person.

00:54:58.579 --> 00:55:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they talk about the
person and the good things

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:01.500 align:middle line:90%
that happen to them.

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
they're overwriting it.

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:06.992 align:middle line:84%
They feel the sadness, but they
feel a tremendous contentment

00:55:06.992 --> 00:55:08.950 align:middle line:84%
that they had the honor
of knowing that person.

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:11.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what I did with
my mother when she died.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.711 align:middle line:90%
And I took my kids to dinner.

00:55:12.711 --> 00:55:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we're going
to talk about her,

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
celebrate knowing her.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Her life, yeah.

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:18.136 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: And it
wasn't morbid at all.

00:55:18.136 --> 00:55:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It was really a sadness
with a sweetness to it.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
good way to mourn.

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Laughter, we had
a lot of laughter.

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So laughter, again, is really a
good antidote for these things.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.663 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did some of
these centenarians

00:55:29.663 --> 00:55:30.870 align:middle line:90%
watch their children die?

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As adults?

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.400 align:middle line:84%
One of them told me a
joke that's a little sick.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But a centenarian told
me, so I'll tell you.

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:40.830 align:middle line:84%
He said that this
couple, centenarians,

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:42.790 align:middle line:90%
go to a marriage counselor.

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:43.620 align:middle line:90%
He's 102.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.820 align:middle line:90%
She's 100.

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And they say, Doctor,
we want a divorce.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.530 align:middle line:90%
A divorce after 70 years?

00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:51.480 align:middle line:84%
No, no, 80 years
we've been together.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.822 align:middle line:90%
But, no, no, you can't.

00:55:52.822 --> 00:55:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So he tries to talk
them out of it.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is it?

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:55.350 align:middle line:90%
They said, no, look.

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.390 align:middle line:84%
We've planned it, and
we've thought about it.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:00.268 align:middle line:84%
And we thought, why don't
we do it after the kids die?

00:56:00.268 --> 00:56:02.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.834 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is pretty morbid.

00:56:04.834 --> 00:56:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: It's true.

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's morbid, but
it's a totally different way

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.839 align:middle line:90%
of looking at the world.

00:56:10.839 --> 00:56:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To live
beyond your children.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Your children, yes.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a very different
way of looking at the world.

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: Since
it's not genetics.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.602 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not cultural.

00:56:19.602 --> 00:56:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: You have
to prepare yourself,

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:24.120 align:middle line:84%
but you have to
mourn without dying.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have to end
an unrequited love

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.870 align:middle line:90%
without getting sick.

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:30.409 align:middle line:90%
That's very important.

00:56:30.409 --> 00:56:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's against
the cultural norm as well.

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes, yes.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I see
how you're looking

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.770 align:middle line:90%
at everything differently.

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: You're welcome.

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I always like
to ask my guests, what

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:45.010 align:middle line:84%
is your biggest why as to
why you do what you do?

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEZ: Why?

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.880 align:middle line:10%
To find meaning in things, to
find meaning in what I'm doing,

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.830 align:middle line:10%
to find meaning in
what I'm doing here,

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:54.460 align:middle line:10%
and to actually explore more
and more that we're not here

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:55.750 align:middle line:10%
just by accident.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.460 align:middle line:10%
We're not just a
Darwinian accident

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.700 align:middle line:10%
that some chemicals
got together,

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.460 align:middle line:10%
and just by accident we--

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.620 align:middle line:10%
I think meaning is more
important than passing on

00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.920 align:middle line:10%
of the genes.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
very interesting.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.820 align:middle line:84%
They call it the
grandmother effect.

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Most animals will die
or start getting sick

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.310 align:middle line:84%
or start looking older after
they don't reproduce anymore,

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:17.650 align:middle line:84%
except the killer
whale and human beings,

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.510 align:middle line:84%
because they have the
grandmother effect.

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.330 align:middle line:10%
The killer whale, after she
can't reproduce anymore,

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:24.310 align:middle line:10%
she'll still take the
pups and teach them where

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.080 align:middle line:10%
they need to go for the food.

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.120 align:middle line:10%
And the grandparents
will do that.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the grandfathers
would do the same thing.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think that you can
trick the immune system

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:34.570 align:middle line:90%
by being creative.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:36.490 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
create children.

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:37.630 align:middle line:90%
You can create projects.

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:38.560 align:middle line:90%
You can create things.

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
centenarians are.

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I saked a 103-year-old
man, so what

00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:45.340 align:middle line:84%
do you want to do
for the next year?

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, I'm
learning German.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, always
learning, lifelong learner.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEZ: So getting
back to your question,

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.980 align:middle line:84%
the why is the meaning
concept of life.

00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you for showing us--
