00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaia Inspirations."

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And our topic for this series
at the Celebrate Your Life

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Conference here in
Phoenix, Arizona,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:84%
is to explore the
"I Am" meaning.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is
Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:84%
She is considered to be a social
architect and a leading voice

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:84%
in innovating change
for this world.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It's such an honor
to have you here.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Barbara.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA MARX HUBBARD:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in exploring the
"I am" context-- and this

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
has been such a great, great
exploration for me-- what

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
is your opinion of the "I
am" statement in this moment?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: My opinion
is that it comes

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
from the source of
creation or God.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And that impulse for
billions of years

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:84%
has been creating quarks
and electrons and protons

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and animals and
humans and now us.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up through the
entire story of creation

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:90%
and it hits me in my heart.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.469 align:middle line:84%
And I realize I am the
universe in person creating.

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that
just gave me chills.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: So that I am
principle in every one of us

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is actually your
unique experience

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
of the creative impulse
of the universe.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And in every person, it's
almost like the God force

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.234 align:middle line:84%
becoming personal
as you to create.

00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.394 align:middle line:90%
The God force.

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: The whole
impulse of creation

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
becomes personal
as Lisa or Barbara.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, there's
a uniqueness about Lisa.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a uniqueness
about Barbara.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So the I am principle in
you is doing differently

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:90%
than the "I am" principle in me.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same principle.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.518 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think you
pretty much just gave

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:90%
the definition of purpose.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.626 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
truly what that is.

00:02:02.626 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the God force
combining with the I am

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:90%
to express itself as purpose.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Exactly.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And each person's
purpose is unique.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But when you say yes to
that I am within you,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:90%
the yes turns on.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It's very different
in the "I am" purpose

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
as to whether you ignore
it, say no to it--

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Important.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Or say yes to it.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Now if you say yes
to it, sometimes it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:90%
will disarrange your life.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.582 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But saying no to it also
could do the opposite,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.529 align:middle line:84%
could cause sickness and
discontent and depression.

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It does.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was depressed in my
life after five children.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:90%
I loved my children.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I love my husband.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:90%
I love my house and my dog.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
However, I didn't have
my impulse of creation.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have my vocation.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.549 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And I
read Abraham Maslow.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said self-rewarding
action is what makes you happy.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't found it yet.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So everybody needs with
the "I am" principle

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
to seek for the uniqueness
of that principle as you

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.431 align:middle line:90%
your purpose.

00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But then he decided
to run for president

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, not
quite at that moment.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:90%
It took a few years.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's all?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.644 align:middle line:90%
In 1984, right?

00:03:17.644 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: No, I
got that actually

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
from my love of
Teilhard de Chardin who

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:84%
said the direction
of evolution is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
to higher consciousness,
greater freedom, and more

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:90%
complex order.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Single cell, multi-cell,
animal, human.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, he saw us becoming
connected through the Noosphere

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:90%
or the social media.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system
of humanity is

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
going to connect us, he said,
in this book in the '60s.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, we're
going to light up with love.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm this discontent housewife
in Lakeville, Connecticut

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:90%
reading this book.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And I hear about
the Noosphere getting its

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:90%
collective I's.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Now I got woken up.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:90%
I said I'm part of that.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm growing with you.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I want to help the Noosphere
get its collective I's.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing it
right now with you.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you are.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: We're in the
thinking layer of earth.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:84%
We're on-- We're on media going
infinitely fast everywhere.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And we are
saying these things

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.849 align:middle line:84%
and they're getting into the
collective nervous system.

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk about social
media for a second because it

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:90%
really truly is that web.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It's connecting
the entire world.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's speeding
things up so much.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're in the
complete technical revolution

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's a new age.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's causing things
to change drastically,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
old systems to break down,
new systems to move faster,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:90%
recreating jobs everywhere.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.389 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel it's
doing for us as a humanity?

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It's so interesting.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
At the same time we notice
things are breaking down,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
like climate change
and resource depletion

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, really dangerous.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the planet is
growing a new nervous system,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.027 align:middle line:90%
Facebook, Twitter, Google--

00:05:04.027 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: LinkedIn.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:90%
All your shows.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And Mark Zuckerberg
said a few weeks ago

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.009 align:middle line:84%
that one day one billion people
were on Facebook the same day.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Whoa.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.725 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Now, that's
1/7 of the human race.

00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's what I
think it means, Lisa.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:84%
If the Noosphere, the thinking
layer, the nervous system

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:84%
is going to connect
us, we need it

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
to have the nervous system,
which is not just mass media,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:90%
it's social media.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And one more degree of
connectivity in the social

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:84%
media, let's say we all
say one morning "I am,"

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.569 align:middle line:84%
the principle of
evolution uniquely me .

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say we all say that.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.568 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:05:47.568 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Or we all say
we're waking up together.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Or we all say we're being born
as a co-creative humanity,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
which I like to say.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:90%
You know what, we'd all get it.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
seven billion of us.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.025 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say we
aim for one billion.

00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:04.524 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:05.914 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you
know, I would love

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
to see one billion people
saying that on Facebook.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes what
I see is gossip

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.524 align:middle line:84%
or what the other person's
doing or, you know,

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
it can be used for
good and bad and it's

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:90%
important to explore that.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, if you think of
the analogy of a newborn baby,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
let's think of us as a
newborn planetary culture.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
We're a baby in terms
of the wisdom of us

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:90%
at the large scale.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.782 align:middle line:90%

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well,
maybe the adolescents.

But they're not mature.

However, lots of mature
people are among them.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't yet taken
kind of a shared voice.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.650 align:middle line:90%
We're not yet a choir.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:84%
People say don't
speak to the choir.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people who
I say are maturity

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.930 align:middle line:84%
are internalizing the divine
spirit one way or the other.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:90%
But we have never come together.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So my major project now is what
I call connecting co-creators

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
in a planetary awakening
together on social media.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: On social media.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: To give
us an experience

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.592 align:middle line:90%
of who we are becoming.

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where are they?

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.841 align:middle line:90%
Where are they on social media?

00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: All over
the world we are.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So the invitation that
we and others-- and I

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
hope you will help
us-- are giving

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
is if you feel you have
a unique "I am" to give,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:90%
we want you to say it.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to put
it on global media.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have a story
of the evolving of humanity.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Out of the crises,
something new is being born.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.705 align:middle line:90%
Connecting the billion.

00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And then we're
going to aim at a billion

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and we'll tell Mark Zuckerberg
it's time for the one billion

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:84%
to be speaking together
of what they're creating.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am in, yes.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.919 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And somebody
said to me the other day,

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
do you want to meet
Mark Zuckerberg.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, possibly,
if he'd like to meet me.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.183 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: He would.

00:08:09.183 --> 00:08:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But I want to be ready
to meet Mark Zuckerberg.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I
think Mark Zuckerberg

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
would be ready to meet you.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Oh, you think so?

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.615 align:middle line:84%
Because you have so much
wisdom to share in such a--

00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was saying
earlier, you're

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:84%
getting younger and
younger and younger.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Your green juice
protocol, what is it?

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:90%
And what was your answer?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well,
my answer is I'm

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
following the "I
am" principle, which

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.297 align:middle line:90%
is an impulse of creativity.

00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's what it is.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And you know what,
I'm not getting younger,

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.915 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting newer.

00:08:38.915 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ooh.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.627 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Now, this is
an interesting thought.

00:08:41.627 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm 85 and obviously
that's a lot of years.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And it looks old.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:90%
But I feel new.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, why am I new?

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.215 align:middle line:90%
Is because the world is new.

00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
connected to that.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: The impulse of
creativity in every one of us

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
is new because evolution
creates newness.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.116 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Now,
particularly when

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:84%
you're at a time of a breakdown
of the whole structure

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
like we are, newness is
cropping up everywhere

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:84%
in all people who are turned
on, like at this conference.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
they're a chorus yet.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.595 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
they're a symphony yet.

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:90%
That's our job.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They expand that to
a global conversation, where

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
there is war and killing
and mass killing happening,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
how do you extend that what
we're doing in this nucleus

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to impact that
conversation, Barbara?

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I think
the first thing to do

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
is to attract together
those already loving.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Because what you do is you
create a field of attraction.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Right now there's no
field of attraction

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
vision of the future.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the negative
activities are

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:90%
caught in the old structures.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.022 align:middle line:84%
The old structures, whether
it be government or--

00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fighting old stories.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: --capitalism.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not the place to go.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But there are business people
who are totally turned on.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
There are government people
who want to do something new.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
There are people in--you
know my wheel of co-creation?

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: You have it there.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which when we talk
about, there's an image

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.328 align:middle line:84%
here we have of the
wheel of co-creation.

00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Explain this because
it's perfect.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It's a perfect one.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
You see the core of the spiral
coming up from the source.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:90%
That's the impulse.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the "I am" impulse.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
It goes through the hub of the
wheel, which is our hearts,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
our love, and also
our unique creativity.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
sectors of the wheel,

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:84%
they're all functions in any
community, health, education,

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
government, science,
arts, media, these are

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:90%
functional components of any--

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is religion on there?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:90%
They're all there.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:58.010 align:middle line:84%
But this is the whole greater
than the sum of the parts.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's a clue, Lisa.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Nature takes jumps by making
separate parts come together

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:90%
in a new whole.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So what we're saying we want
to do for planetary awakening

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
is offer this wheel
at local levels

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.216 align:middle line:90%
all the way on up to global.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're interested in health,
you're interested in education,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
you're interested
in spirituality,

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:90%
you map yourself in the wheel.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you had
an incredible DVD

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that you did a while
ago talking about how

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.440 align:middle line:90%
crisis proceeds transformation.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.012 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
beautiful artwork

00:11:33.012 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that your friend did that
we're going to also--

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Larry Delf, yes.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.316 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're going to
show you an image of this

00:11:38.316 --> 00:11:40.594 align:middle line:84%
as well of this beautiful
labyrinth, right?

00:11:40.594 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: He made
a labyrinth out

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:84%
of all the concepts in
conscious evolution.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so one
of these concepts

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:84%
is crisis proceeds
transformation.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see this
on the screen here.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Crisis proceeds
transformation is

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.962 align:middle line:84%
what you're talking
about in terms

00:11:55.962 --> 00:11:57.170 align:middle line:90%
of this wheel of co-creation.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you link those
two together for us?

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:06.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've had five mass
extinctions before we got here.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're heading for the sixth
mass extinction of our life

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:90%
support system on this planet.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
The difference is we know
we're heading for a problem,

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:84%
therefore this crisis
that's now going on

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:84%
among our global
culture is awakening

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
innovations, creative solutions,
concerns all over the earth.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And as Elizabet Sahtouris says,
crises proceeds transformation.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Problems are
evolutionary drivers.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the only thing
that causes evolution.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.314 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it has six
times prior-- or five times--

00:12:45.314 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Five times.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.896 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --prior.

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Because the
system isn't working.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, nature's genius is
when things are not working,

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:90%
look for what is working.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Look for innovations,
creative solutions, new ideas.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we have a lot
of innovations around now?

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And the denial factor is
no longer going to work.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.227 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
a place where we

00:13:08.227 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
can no longer be in
denial of the fact

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:90%
that we have a crisis pending.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:90%
There has to be solutions.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:90%
There has to be--

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: And that's good.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So that means thousands
if not hundreds

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
of thousands or millions of
people because of the crisis

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:90%
are open to what's new.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're not getting it
from their government leaders.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.717 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: They're not getting
it from the current mass news.

00:13:30.717 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Which is always
noticing what isn't working.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Renewable energy is
a perfect example of that.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: So what we're saying
is let's have a new news.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.374 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:39.374 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Lisa, that's you.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And let's
have the emergent news

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and let's show it's
part of a whole system.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
here's a little bit

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
of random good news over here
or random good news over here.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Here is a convergence
of what's emergent.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is beautiful.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I wanted you to take
a look at a video

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
where Barbara is talking about
this wheel of co-creation.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: So I've invited
you to reinvent the wheel

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and to enter the
wheel of co-creation.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it
close up, you'll

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:84%
see that the core of the
spiral, spirit and action,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
comes through the
hub of the wheel.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm calling that a new
sacred space in evolution,

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
where the design, the pattern,
and the process of what's

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:90%
being created is revealed.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And in that hub is the first
global communication hub.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
The whole wheel is going to
inform the global communication

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
hub about what's working in
every sector of the wheel.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And people are
going to be invited

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:84%
to communicate from the
global communication hub

00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:84%
with the voice of their own
deeper experience, their deeper

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
spiritual understanding,
their deeper

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:84%
social, scientific, and
political initiatives that

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
are coming from
the source of love,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
that are coming from the
source of creativity,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that are coming from the
impulse of evolution that's

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:84%
created the entire
universe coming through us.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be a
new global communication.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
The news as it
now exist tells us

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:90%
everything that's breaking down.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
This will be the new news
from the global communication

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:84%
hub that tells you everything
that's breaking through.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And once we see the
emerging world in our midst

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and know that each one
of us is part of it,

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:90%
we can shift the world.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So please become a member of
the evolutionary community

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and join me in the
global communication hub

00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and become a voice for
conscious evolution of humanity.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a phrase taken
from the book "I Am That."

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's to know what you are is
to investigate what we are not.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So to know what we are, we need
to investigate what we are not.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:90%
What are we not?

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
What can we let go of in order
for this emergence to come?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: It's
a great question.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:84%
You see, I think
what we're letting go

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:90%
of is self-centered separation.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens
sapiens, our species

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:90%
was really good at this.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We're a brilliant species
if you think of neanderthal

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and then you think of homo
sapiens and sapiens sapiens,

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
we are self-conscious
species, which is new.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And that self-consciousness
gradually

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.660 align:middle line:84%
led to a sense of an
illusion of separation

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.720 align:middle line:84%
from nature, from each
other, and from spirit.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Out of survival?

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Out of survival
and intelligence too.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:84%
Because when we got to
modern science out of more

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
traditional religion,
modern science

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:90%
began to notice how things grow.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
come up with the idea

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
of a materialistic universe,
a universe with no purpose.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
That's the modern
scientific view.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, people in
this purposeless universe

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:90%
didn't have much purpose.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we became there was a
whole period of existentialism,

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.987 align:middle line:84%
absurdism, nihilism,
materialism.

00:17:31.987 --> 00:17:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Competition.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Competition, let's
get ahead of each other,

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:90%
win over each other.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened is that's
going to destroy everybody.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, it's not just going
to destroy the weaker person,

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:84%
everybody's weaker
because a separated state

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
with the degree of power started
for me with the atomic bomb.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But you think of nanotech,
biotech, quantum computing,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and thermonuclear
weapons, do you

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:84%
think in a self-centric
conscious state

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
we can handle all this
power for the good?

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's going to implode.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.436 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: But
what is happening--

00:18:09.436 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I want to
really emphasize-- innovative,

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
creative, and loving people
are coming up everywhere.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.085 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my early 60s,
I never met anyone like me.

00:18:23.085 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I thought I was
like a mutant of some sort.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I first met
Jonas Salk in in 1964.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And I told him everything
that was wrong with me.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in the future
as I'm going somewhere,

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:90%
I have more to do.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Freudian
analysis, she's neurotic.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:90%
That's what was wrong me.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm neurotic because
I wanted more.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the women were to have
babies and be sure to take

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:90%
care of their homes and so on.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
When I discovered that I
had more to do that's good,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Jonas said, Barbara, this is
not what's wrong about you,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:90%
it's what's right about you.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:90%
You are a mutant.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:90%
This was 1964.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.442 align:middle line:84%
He said, I will introduce
you to three or four mutants

00:19:14.442 --> 00:19:15.366 align:middle line:90%
that I met.

00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And one was the department
of neuropharmacology

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
at Johns Hopkins, another
was a science editor

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.760 align:middle line:84%
of "Life Magazine,"
L. Rosenfeld.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.935 align:middle line:90%
And these were evolutionaries.

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Now, I did discover
through Teilhard de Chardin

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:84%
there are two types
of people on earth.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:84%
One, the progressives,
who are tending

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
to be attracted to the
future as something

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:90%
emerging to the unknown.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The other side is the
bourgeois, attempting

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.820 align:middle line:84%
to keep everything
the way it is.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're a
bourgeois and you're

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:84%
attempting to keep
everything the way

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
it is now in the midst of all
of this, you're going to fail.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's definitely
not going to work.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.493 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: We have
reactive religions,

00:19:57.493 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
we have reactive
politics, and we

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:90%
have reactive battles going on.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:90%
They will fail.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we have attraction
to what's creative and new.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
That has not become
the news yet.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
That has not yet
become connected.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So that is the purpose
of people like myself

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and you and others
is let's connect

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:84%
what's attractive because
it's going to help the system

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:23.449 align:middle line:90%
move forward.

00:20:23.449 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's getting there
fast, though, Barbara.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: It is and we
have the internet now.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: We have
people like you, Lisa.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.531 align:middle line:84%
We have hundreds of thousands
of people who are turned on.

00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:35.946 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Everywhere.

00:20:35.946 --> 00:20:38.434 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's speeding
up and it's not so far away.

00:20:38.434 --> 00:20:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: That's
what I'm saying.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It better not be because
how many years do we

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.356 align:middle line:90%
have to misuse power?

00:20:44.356 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Not many.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:90%
It's timing.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Time is getting shorter.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.436 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Short timing, Lisa.

00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How far away
would you think that is?

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, I was talking
to Ervin Laszlo the other day

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.716 align:middle line:90%
about five years.

00:20:53.716 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And we've been saying
maybe by the year

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%
2020 we could have enough
connectivity to shift

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle line:90%
the system to know the positive.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Not to solve everything
but to know the direction.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And Ervin said to me,
you know, Barbara, it

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
may not be five years
because let's be aware

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that it's the unexpected
that's going to happen,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.935 align:middle line:84%
like a flood in Nice that drowns
people in their cars with no

00:21:18.935 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:84%
know attention to a possible
flood in Nice, France.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
All these mudslides
is suddenly come down

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:90%
and overwhelm communities.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
This can happen
anywhere, anytime.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So the faster we
can get together

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
at the nexus of
where we're creative

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and create a communication
system among creativity.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, Lisa, this is no
accident, this interview.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is so powerful.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:90%
This is so powerful.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And think of how fast things
have moved and progressed

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.277 align:middle line:90%
in the last five years.

00:21:50.277 --> 00:21:50.902 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Yes.

00:21:50.902 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In four years, it will
go two to three times as fast.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.915 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: It will.

00:21:54.915 --> 00:21:55.415 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:57.886 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Now, I'm
going to be 90 in 2020.

00:21:57.886 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's right.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:90%
That's right, yes.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: So I've decided to
the next five years of my life

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.390 align:middle line:84%
from 85 to 90 is given
to this like 100%

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and to supporting
everybody who's attracted.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.224 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what are
we doing together?

00:22:12.224 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: You and I are going
to be doing a lot together.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I can see this.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We all are.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.941 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at this video where

00:22:17.941 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Barbara's talking about
awakening our social potential.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Conscious evolution
is evolution by choice

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.600 align:middle line:90%
not chance.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
For billions of years,
evolution has been progressing.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:90%
We've had five mass extinctions.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:42.245 align:middle line:84%
We've had billions of species
extinct before we got here.

00:22:42.245 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing is that we

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:84%
are the very first species
on planet earth aware

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:90%
of our own evolution.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:84%
We've heard about the billions
of years of evolution.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
We are the first species
to know we are affecting

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
our own evolution by everything
we do, the babies we have,

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
the food we eat, the cars
we drive, the wars we fight,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:84%
even the thoughts we
hold about each other.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that
we are affecting

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:84%
our evolution in such a manner
that we might to devolve.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We might destroy our
life support system.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:84%
We might actually render
ourselves extinct.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:84%
What this amounts to
is the greatest wakeup

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
call that humanity has ever
had because no species has

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:84%
been responsible for its
own devolution or evolution.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:90%
We have no experience in this.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, we're
entering the first stage

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:90%
of conscious evolution.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in retrospect
when we look back on this age,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
it will be as great
a breakthrough

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:84%
as was self-reflective
consciousness

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.780 align:middle line:90%
in the neanderthal world.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.730 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: What is the
social potential movement?

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: We know what the
human potential movement was.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It was when Abraham
Maslow, the psychologist,

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:84%
began to study human
wellness rather than illness.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And he identified a
new kind of person.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:90%
It was in the 1960s.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And he called it a
self-actualizing human.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is somebody
with self-rewarding work

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that they find intrinsically
valuable and of service.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And when he mapped
the characteristics

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.160 align:middle line:84%
of the self-actualizing
person, we

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
began to try to be
self-actualizing.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And it started the human
potential movement,

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:84%
the transpersonal movement, the
whole consciousness movement

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:84%
was really started
by that thought.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
The social potential
movement is the next step

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:84%
as he identified peaks
of human wellness

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and got the
self-actualizing person,

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
it's time to identify the peaks
of social excellence, social

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:90%
innovation, social wellness.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we could trace the
peaks in health and education

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and economics and
science and technology

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and energy and government that
are working at the highest

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:84%
level, we would
have the beginning

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:90%
of the self-actualizing society.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And my book
"Conscious Evolution--

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Awakening the Power of
Our Social Potential

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
is an early contribution to
the self-actualizing society.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And if that takes hold like the
self-actualizing person does,

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
we will begin to see more
of us working to actualize

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:90%
our social potential.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
INTERVIEWER: What
do mean problems are

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:90%
evolutionary drivers?

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: It's very
obvious we find it

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
in our own personal
lives and we find it

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
in the life of the
larger social system.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Problems are
evolutionary drivers

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
because you either solve them
by doing better and changing

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:90%
something or they do you in.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Another phrase is crises
precede transformation.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And in evolution when you
look at the billions of years

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.900 align:middle line:84%
of transformation,
almost every time there

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
is a quantum jump of a
higher order from single cell

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
to multi-cell to
animal to human,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:84%
you will find a series of
crises to the life form

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:90%
just before the jump.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way nature takes jumps
through crises and problems

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
is this mysterious
function of being

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:84%
able to connect separate parts
to make a new whole greater

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.880 align:middle line:90%
than the sum of its parts.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can see right now
our culture is under stress.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
We have a crises to
our entire environment.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We have a crises
with global warming.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We have the possibility of
running out of fresh water.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:90%
We are in danger.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:90%
What is that doing?

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
It's making us
realize that we have

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:84%
to change our economic
system, our political system,

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and our war machine.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:84%
It means we're going to
have to learn to cooperate.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you jump over
the crisis and imagine

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
us being able to
respond co-creatively,

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to see a
much better future and a much

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
better humanity or devolution
and extinction, that's

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.944 align:middle line:90%
the driver.

00:27:19.944 --> 00:27:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your latest
book-- and I'm

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:84%
going to grab this--
"The Evolutionary

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Testament of Co-Creation."

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:84%
You have essentially
rewritten the Bible.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this book.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I was inspired
by a Christ experience.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I was asking the question
what kind of person

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
can handle all the power,
nanotech, biotech, quantum,

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:90%
powers of gods.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And I got an image,
oh, it's Christ.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:90%
He had the powers of gods.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:48.209 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And He said to us,
you will do the works that I do

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and greater works will you
do in the fullness of time.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So I happened to be near
the Mount Calvary Monastery

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.470 align:middle line:90%
in Santa Barbara.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I got in there, I
opened up New Testament,

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:90%
and I started to read.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.282 align:middle line:84%
I started with Saint Paul,
behold I show you a mystery.

00:28:07.282 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:90%
We shall all not sleep.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.040 align:middle line:84%
We shall all be
changed in a moment

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:90%
in the twinkling of an eye.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:90%
And I started to write.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh my God,
it's all coming true.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.300 align:middle line:84%
We are the generation
that can do the work

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus said we could do.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:84%
We are the generation who
can destroy the world.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
We're also the
generation that can

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.900 align:middle line:90%
evolve the world through love.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And so this book is an
evolutionary perspective

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.240 align:middle line:90%
on the New Testament.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't rewrite any
of the Scripture.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I took the Scripture
then I just allowed

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
an evolutionary
futuristic interpretation

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to say how would we
actually do all this, folks?

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: And made it all real.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, you didn't
rewrite the Bible,

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
you gave you a different
perspective on the Bible.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.664 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: And
evolutionary perspective

00:28:56.664 --> 00:28:58.344 align:middle line:90%
on Gospels, Acts, and Epistles.

00:28:58.344 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk
about Acts for a second.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Because this is one that
I opened to just randomly

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
when I was talking
with you about this

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:90%
and discovering your new book.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And in this you say about
be the Day of the Pentecost

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.670 align:middle line:90%
was fully come.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.714 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk
about this for a second.

00:29:13.714 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Well, the way
that Christianity got

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.920 align:middle line:84%
started after
Jesus' Crucifixion,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Resurrection, it was
extremely dangerous

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.950 align:middle line:84%
because the Romans
were killing people.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:84%
What happened a gathering,
what they call the Upper

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Room, about 90 days I think it
was after Jesus' disappearance.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And people started to
hear the Disciples speak

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.730 align:middle line:90%
in their own language.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So they had an
international audience.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Galileans were speaking
and everybody could hear it

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
in their own language.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And someone got up and
say how is this possible.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And Peter got up
and said it's what's

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.080 align:middle line:84%
prophesied by the Prophet Joel
at the last days the Lord will

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.320 align:middle line:90%
pour Spirit upon all flesh.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And your young men
will dream dreams

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and your old men
will see visions.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe that's
true that at some point

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:84%
this nervous system
is going to connect us

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
see a vision together.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I got very excited
about that and was

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.302 align:middle line:84%
able to write just
a little bit here.

00:30:12.302 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you want me to read?

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Or do
you want to read?

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure, you, yes.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:16.943 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: OK.

00:30:16.943 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So what I got here for us
after reading this whole thing

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:84%
on the Pentecost,
which anybody can read

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.510 align:middle line:84%
is "Now, dearly beloveds,
your time has come.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.990 align:middle line:84%
You are the second
generation of Disciples.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.900 align:middle line:84%
You, all of you, are to go
forth and tell the new story

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:90%
to your generation.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:84%
You are to tell the
world we are rising.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
We now have the capacity to do
the works that, I, Jesus, did

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.610 align:middle line:90%
and greater works can you do.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:84%
You who believe in your
capacity to do as I did

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:90%
are the new Disciples.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:84%
You will work together for
the planetary Pentecost.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the alternative to
Armageddon, a time on Earth

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.675 align:middle line:84%
when all of those who choose to
occupy the Upper Room of "I am"

00:31:00.675 --> 00:31:01.300 align:middle line:90%
consciousness--

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: --simultaneously
in this aligned field

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of love and expectation,
you will all

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:13.030 align:middle line:84%
hear in your own language,
in your own words,

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.710 align:middle line:84%
in your own inner voices,
the mighty works of God

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.930 align:middle line:90%
that you are to do."

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.685 align:middle line:90%
All of you.

00:31:19.685 --> 00:31:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It could have
been written today.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:90%
That is exactly.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:90%
That is beautifully said.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.882 align:middle line:84%
The perfect combination of,
as it said, old and new.

00:31:30.882 --> 00:31:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Old and new.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the sacred
text of humanity, this

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.690 align:middle line:90%
is one of them.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Our sources of wisdom
for evolutionary consciousness.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I have evolutionary
consciousness.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you do.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I see the whole
impulse of evolution.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you
say how old are you?

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, I'm about
13 billion years old.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know why?

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Every atom, molecule, cell,
lower brain, mammalian brains,

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:90%
neocortex, boom.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is in you.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Everyone.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.958 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everyone.

00:32:01.958 --> 00:32:04.735 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: Everyone is the
whole story come alive.

00:32:04.735 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a great thought?

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, it is.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's so beautiful
because that is our story.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:84%
As you said, many of the
ancient texts are stories.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And we are creating
a new story now.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:18.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's the whole point.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're talking
about is co-creating

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.896 align:middle line:84%
a story, a new
story of creation.

00:32:23.896 --> 00:32:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: That
is exactly right.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm a storyteller.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you are.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:90%
And a story liver.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.363 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: You're welcome.

00:32:31.363 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So appreciate you--

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HUBBARD: I love
being on with you.

>>LISA: I appreciate
your presence

00:32:35.226 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:84%

that you represent and inspire

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:90%
in all of us.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Barbara.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HUBBARD: Thank you, beloved.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Truly.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:90%
