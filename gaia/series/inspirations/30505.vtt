00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of "Gaiam
Inspirations," coming to you

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.320 align:middle line:84%
from Gaiam's beautiful
Los Angeles studios.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:90%
So do you have a dream?

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Have you always
treated it like a dream

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and have not yet
brought it into reality?

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
My guest today says that the
single most important dream

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do with
the business you're in.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
These are the words of America's
dream coach Marcia Wieder.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.310 align:middle line:10%
Marcia's the CEO and
founder of Dream University,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:10%
and she has over 25 years of
experience, business and life

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:10%
coaching.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:10%
And she's appeared several times
on "Oprah" and "The Today Show"

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:10%
and her own PBS TV special.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
She's written 14
books, and she's here

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.302 align:middle line:90%
today with us on Gaiam TV.

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me, Marcia.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> MARCIA WIEDER: I love
being with you, Lisa.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It's and honor to
be with you again.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I know.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.810 align:middle line:90%
We have a good time.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yes.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You were
on Gaiam TV before.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: It was an honor.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:90%
But the new digs are gorgeous.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Isn't it gorgeous?

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I want people to
know that the scene behind us is

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not a set.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Those-- that's
the sunshine just singing

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:90%
on the Hollywood Hills.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little bit about
your distinction between what

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.385 align:middle line:90%
a dream is.

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yes.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're not talking
about nighttime dreams,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:84%
although those are
important as well.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:10%
I define a dream as
something that you want.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.670 align:middle line:10%
And distinct from a fantasy,
like winning the lottery,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:10%
in a dream you can design
a strategy or a plan

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.160 align:middle line:10%
to make it happen.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So is it like a goal,
or is it different than a goal?

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: It is
similar to a goal.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
more heart-based,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
because where dreams come
from is you make them up.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are based on
need, like putting food

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
on the table or a desire,
like sending your kids

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:84%
to a good school, which
is more like a goal,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
but the dreams that
come from your heart

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
or that are the expression
of your purpose in life

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:90%
are usually the most profound.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
I would add that standing
in your purpose, the quality

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
of your dreams and the
quality of your life

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.584 align:middle line:90%
will actually change.

00:02:09.584 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that's actually a
really good formula that you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:90%
just said.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.764 align:middle line:84%
Standing in your
purpose-- what was that?

00:02:14.764 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Knowing who you are and
why you're here and asking

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
the question-- how do
I want my life to be?--

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
will allow you to really
create a dream-come-true life.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Rather than that
check-off list of 10 things

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.426 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
We're so mired in reality
and so busy living

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:84%
from our clocks and
calendars that many of us

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:84%
don't even know what our
dreams are, much less

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.401 align:middle line:90%
how to make them happen.

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.358 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's such a fine
line, Marcia, though,

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because people say, well,
if you have a dream,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to happen unless
it gets into your calendar.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: It's true.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.947 align:middle line:84%
Reality is an important
part of the mix.

00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:90%
I love that you brought that up.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
We have to know
where we are in order

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to design the strategy
for where we want to go.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, what
has being realistic cost you?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
If you're overly
realistic, you'll

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
often compromise
your dreams down

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
to be realistic
and usually based

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
on how much money you have
in your checking account.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So this work is
about getting people

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:84%
to open up to grander
possibilities,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
inviting you to swing out
of just being realistic,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
use reality
appropriately to plan,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
to design projects
and strategies

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and build your dream team,
not as the justification

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.126 align:middle line:84%
to minimize what
you really want.

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So how do you
build that dream team?

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
How do you get other
people to align

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.201 align:middle line:84%
behind what it is
that you want to do?

00:03:28.201 --> 00:03:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: It's one
of my favorite topics,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
because I believe the number
one way to experience ease

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and shortcuts on any dream
is to build a dream team,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
to share your dream
like a visionary.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So you articulate it with
clarity so people get it,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:84%
you express it with passion so
people get excited about it,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and, most importantly,
you master

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
the skill of what
we call enrollment.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
In order to master
manifestation,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
you must master the
ability to inspire

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:90%
other people to join you.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So how you talk about your
dream, the specific requests

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that you make, you know, are
you making it easy for people

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.935 align:middle line:90%
to say yes?

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
saying no, are you

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:90%
having the guts to ask them why?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So the way to build
a dream team is

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
to have a vision-- an audacious
but achievable vision--

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.105 align:middle line:84%
that people get excited
about, demonstrate

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to them and to the world
that you're not just

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
talking about it-- you're
doing something about it--

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and then make specific
requests and make it easy

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
for them to say yes, and
invite them to join you.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Life changes, your
dream team comes alive

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
when you're able to
really articulate

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
your vision in a way that
gets others to join you.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.635 align:middle line:84%
Because the obstacle called not
enough money can disappear--

00:04:38.635 --> 00:04:39.176 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I was just going
to bring that up.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.968 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --when you can
inspire people to hire you,

00:04:42.968 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to join you, even
to invest in you.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So if you
don't have the means--

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.199 align:middle line:84%
the financial means-- in order
to start your dream and you

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
want to get a team but
you don't have the money--

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this so many times--
how do you get everything

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:90%
aligned?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.299 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about--
Now, I know you.

00:04:58.299 --> 00:04:59.965 align:middle line:84%
I've known you for a
long time, and I've

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:84%
had the pleasure of being
with you in conferences.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:90%
I know how accountable you are.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:84%
When you hear something, you're
like, wait, that's not true.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Maybe look at it this way.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
You're so good with
stuff like that.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Even
calling myself on it.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.641 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wait a minute.

00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:16.425 align:middle line:84%
I know I said yes,
but I really mean no.

00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So you're touching on a
couple of different points.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
One is you and I
have both seen often

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
people go further in life with
their passion and commitment

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.287 align:middle line:84%
than with skill, experience,
and gobs of money.

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So when people say to me
money is the thing that's

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
stopping me, and I say
to them, really, how much

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
do you need, and they
go, I don't know,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.640 align:middle line:84%
but I know I don't
have enough, that's

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
one of those stories
we tell ourselves.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So inside of us, we have this
dreamer that says, yes, I can.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
We have this doubter
that says, no, you can't.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And we have this realist that
wants to know what's the plan?

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.225 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going
to get the time

00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and where are you
going to get the money?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: But in the
early phases of the dream,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
you may not have
it all figured out.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why going
to reality and strategy

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
too soon can compromise
the dream down.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Now this doubter voice,
nothing activates

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
our own personal
doubt more than saying

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
you're going to do
something and not

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
doing it or saying you're
going to write the book

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.299 align:middle line:90%
and never sitting down to start.

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.965 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So next time
you get a dream or a vision

00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:19.437 align:middle line:84%
or a creative idea, that doubter
pulls out that very long file

00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
drawer and says, wait a minute,
look at all the times that you

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
said you were going to do
something and not do it.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And you didn't, yeah.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.695 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So I'll
sum it up like this.

00:06:26.695 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
In order to go for
big dreams, you

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
have to have the
courage and guts.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
willing to take risks.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order to take risks,
we need to trust ourselves.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have found the thing that
will either deepen or erode

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
self-trust has everything to
do with how you make and keep

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
your agreements with
yourself and others.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So the question
is, are you trustworthy?

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.151 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Look what you've done.

00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:52.556 align:middle line:90%
You've created a 25-year career.

00:06:52.556 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: It's really 30,
but it sounded too long.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: We'll keep it at 25.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:90%
As a dream coach.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I've trained and
certified over 1,000 dream

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:90%
coaches.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.120 align:middle line:84%
This work is being taught in
companies, schools, prisons,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.580 align:middle line:90%
battered women's shelters.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.809 align:middle line:90%
I'm incredibly proud of that.

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.601 align:middle line:84%
You created something out
of nothing, out of concepts.

00:07:09.601 --> 00:07:11.933 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Not only that,
people told me I would starve.

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
People said, you can't
make a business out

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
of helping people
achieve their dreams.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm very proud
to tell you I've

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:84%
grown a multimillion-dollar
business.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
But also I'm on the
board for Make-A-Wish.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I've worked for three
United States presidents.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.294 align:middle line:90%
Dreaming-- I mean, if you--

00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:25.835 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: I know.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:90%
You didn't even know that.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Jack Canfield's
coach, I knew that.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I was Jack's
personal coach for many years,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and that was
certainly a privilege.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:84%
But he's done "Chicken Soup" and
"the Secret" and "The Success

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Principles."

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think what people
love about my work is

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that it's very whole brained,
visionary and creative

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
while also being
practical and strategic.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:90%
We need both.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Also head and heart.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
At Dream University, we invite
you to explore who are you?

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:84%
What is your purpose, your
mission, your calling?

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And then what are the personal
and professional dreams

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
that you would make
up that have you

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
live in alignment or in
integrity with your soul?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
happens for a lot of us

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.151 align:middle line:84%
is that instead of our ego
being in service to our soul,

00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:84%
which, I think, is the
way it's supposed to be--

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.275 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting, yeah.

00:08:11.275 --> 00:08:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --I think our
ego hijacks our soul,

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and our dreams become
about-- in service to ego.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think the journey
home is to remember

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that living on purpose requires
three things: one, that we have

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual practice so
we can hear the quieter

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.195 align:middle line:90%
voice beneath the ego--

00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: The whispers, yes.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.736 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --two, you know
what's unique and special about

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
you, formed out of every
success and every failure that

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
you've had, and, number three,
you find a way to be of service

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:90%
with your gifts.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think,
ultimately, a true dream

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
come true life is
about living on purpose

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.069 align:middle line:84%
and living in integrity
with your heart and soul.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, it's interesting
because you take that message

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
across all sorts of
different audiences,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.429 align:middle line:84%
from corporations to
TED conferences, to--

00:08:55.429 --> 00:08:56.095 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Kids.

00:08:56.095 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: --personal
development, kids.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Girl Scout camp.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.044 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, that's right.

00:08:59.044 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
You worked-- We're going to
take a look at Marcia in action

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:90%
This is Marcia Wieder.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: The single most
important dream has everything

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
business you're in.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm really honored to tell
you that this work of helping

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
people get clear about what
they do and don't want,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:84%
believing in themselves, and
taking action on those dreams

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
is being taught in corporations,
school systems, nonprofits,

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
in the corporate world, but
also in prisons and in shelters.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you're here and
you have a nonprofit,

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:84%
please see me sometime
during this day,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:84%
because I have
stuff I want to give

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:84%
you to help and support you in
making your dream a reality.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:10%
Dreaming is a whole
brained process,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:10%
visionary and creative,
practical and strategic.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:10%
We need both.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:10%
The dream movement is not
just about any old step.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:10%
There's a very specific and
critical step we need to take.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:10%
Because most of us stand
with one foot firmly planted

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:10%
in reality and the other foot
firmly planted in our doubt.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And the realist says,
you shouldn't do that.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And the doubter
says, and here's why.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, nothing
activates that doubter more

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
than saying you're
going to do one thing

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and not doing anything at all.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:10%
When we stop dreaming, the brain
sends a message to the body

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:10%
that it's no longer
needed, and we

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:10%
start to mentally or
physically self-destruct.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:10%
So what's the cure?

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:10%
Passion and dreams.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.558 align:middle line:10%
Connected to your
passion, you have

00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:10%
more energy, more enthusiasm.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Connected to your
dreams, you have a reason

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to get out of bed
in the morning.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Enrollment for me is very
different than selling.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.890 align:middle line:10%
Enrollment is when
you share your vision,

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:10%
your ideas, your
business opportunity

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:10%
in a way that inspires
other people to join you.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Now look, how many
of you would say

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
it would be a dream come true if
you didn't have to sell people

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:84%
but they came begging you to
be part of your dream team?

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:10%
Share your dream
like a visionary.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:10%
A visionary has a
vision or a big dream.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:10%
A visionary articulates
it with clarity

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:10%
so people understand what it is.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:10%
A visionary shares the
opportunity with passion

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:10%
so people are excited
and want to know more.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.975 align:middle line:10%
And a true visionary invites,
inspires, and enrolls others

00:11:29.975 --> 00:11:34.850 align:middle line:10%
in joining them, sharing your
vision, your opportunity,

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:10%
your energy, your
passion in a way that

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:10%
inspires other
people to join you.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Show them how this company
is the vehicle for making

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
those dreams a
reality and how you're

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:84%
going to be their dream
coach to supportively hold

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
them accountable in taking
the next step and then

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:90%
the next step.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
That becomes a very
compelling reason for people

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:90%
to get involved in the business.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:10%
>>What Marcia Wieder was
able to provide for myself

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:10%
and my organization
was a program

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:10%
that I could use to allow my
employees to see that what they

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:10%
want to happen in their
life is important.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>When your boss actually
takes the time to notice

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and cares about
you, it's like, OK,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I really want to do a
good job to show her

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that I appreciate what
she's done for me.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:10%
>>I knew at some
level that if I just

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:10%
kept taking the steps
forward in my own dream

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:10%
and what I believed in, that
ultimately I would see results.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>I was leery.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.690 align:middle line:90%
It was an investment.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And as any investment
in business,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.029 align:middle line:84%
you're always leery
of what kind of return

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get on it.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>Steven is very numbers-driven,
and he was very frustrated

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and very irritated by the fact
that I was taking bottom line

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.470 align:middle line:84%
profits to invest in
quote, unquote "dreaming."

>>We saw our sales
increase 14.2%,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:10%
14.2% as a company
sales increase.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:10%
Profitability was up 20%.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:10%
>>I believe that
the reason we're

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:10%
seeing the sales increases
that we're seeing

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:10%
is because we are completely
engaged with our employees.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Be an example
that no dream is impossible

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and the extraordinary things
that can happen when we come

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:10%
And my friends,
that's what America

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.380 align:middle line:10%
needs from us right now.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what your companies need.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
That's what our
schools need to be

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:90%
reminded that our dreams matter.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's never been a
better or more important

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.980 align:middle line:84%
time to actually go
for those dreams.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:42.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So tell me how the
audiences have changed over

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
the years, or if you've
changed your messaging at all

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.519 align:middle line:84%
to the groups that
you speak with.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Well, at
a personal level,

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.196 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
I just thought, oh,

00:13:55.196 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:90%
this is what's in my heart.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll speak about it.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And people resonated with it.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:90%
And the economy was strong.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
People were focused on achieving
their own dreams, goodies,

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
new houses, new
cars, even though I

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
felt that there was
a deeper message.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
economy tanked,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:84%
people started becoming
afraid of dreaming

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and started really
holding back on what

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:84%
they were investing
their money on.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed consistent,
that it's never

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
been a better or more important
time to go for your dreams,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
that regardless of what's
going on in the economy,

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:84%
in the stock market, or in
your own checkbook, that's not

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.277 align:middle line:84%
actually the ideal place
to look for evidence of

00:14:34.277 --> 00:14:35.985 align:middle line:84%
whether or not your
dream is a good idea.

00:14:35.985 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's true.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: If something really
matters to you and you can

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
master the skill we were talking
about earlier of enrollment,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.920 align:middle line:84%
it's not really about how much
money you have in the bank.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
happened is that I discovered

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:84%
there was research done-- Dr.
Mehmet Oz personally told me--

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that people with
passion and dreams

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:90%
live 7 to 10 years longer.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: There's a medical
term for it called apoptosis,

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's something like
when your brain believes

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
you've outgrown your usefulness,
which we see when people

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:84%
retire, get laid off,
experience an empty nest,

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
or when you stop dreaming,
the brain sends a message

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.710 align:middle line:84%
to the body that it's
no longer needed.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I started talking
to boomers and said,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
you're going to live a longer,
happier, healthier life if you

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:84%
have dreams, they
started getting

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.469 align:middle line:84%
very interested in
the message again.

00:15:23.469 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So it
really has morphed.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I can't even believe,
literally, that it's

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.397 align:middle line:84%
been three decades
that I'm teaching this.

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And at a personal level, the
thing that I didn't realize

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:84%
would happen was I started
being branded and recognized

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
as a thought leader because
I was talking about something

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and writing so many books
about it for such a long time.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's interesting.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: So I love it.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.423 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I was going to ask how
you use any of your techniques

00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:48.762 align:middle line:84%
on yourself when you're getting
up during the day or planning

00:15:48.762 --> 00:15:50.720 align:middle line:84%
your next year or what
it is that you're doing.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly reinventing
yourself in different ways

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I am, and I'm
no longer ashamed of it.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I used think that I was
a kooky entrepreneur.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.495 align:middle line:90%
But this is what you talk about.

00:16:00.495 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And also it's
what makes me happy.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.744 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned that I have
a really big value on happy.

00:16:04.744 --> 00:16:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I've learned-- it
sounds overly simple,

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:84%
but it's so great for
your audience, Lisa--

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:84%
that for each of us to know
what is your North Star.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
For some people,
it's about peace.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.819 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's
about productivity.

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's about happy.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm happy,
that's feedback for me

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.057 align:middle line:84%
that I'm in integrity with
my own heart and soul.

00:16:23.057 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.015 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So a
couple of things.

00:16:25.015 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
One is I'm always asking myself
a very confronting question,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.742 align:middle line:84%
which is how do I
want my life to be?

00:16:30.742 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's confronting
because if you

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
are someone who practices
living with integrity,

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:84%
the next question has to be what
am I willing to do about it?

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
There was a time
when I had my B list.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I was unhappy with my business,
my body, my boyfriend, my bank

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
account, and the
building I was living in.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.954 align:middle line:84%
My life added up to a big
F. And I thought, well,

00:16:49.954 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
if I'm really going to
practice what I preach,

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I have to make some changes.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is I say to people

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
don't look in your
checkbook for evidence of

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.370 align:middle line:84%
whether or not your
dream is a good idea.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:90%
I really needed to move.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I was living in a
really toxic situation.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
I bought a house, and
it wasn't disclosed

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.070 align:middle line:84%
that there had been a false
floor built to cover up

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that the house had
slipped on the foundation.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.751 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my god.

00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:15.414 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: It was a
nightmare, four years of hell

00:17:15.414 --> 00:17:16.479 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of dollars.

00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.353 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And finally I
realized that I had to practice

00:17:19.353 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
what I preach and say no more
and have the courage to pull

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
the plug on something, even
though I had a lot of money

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:84%
in it and it was
tricky to navigate.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I realized that if
I didn't do what

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I said I was going to do--
I jokingly said it was my

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
come to Jesus moment, which is
a big deal for a Jewish girl.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes, yes.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:90%
But it works.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: But I could no longer
continue to teach or coach

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:84%
or consult or write or speak
about my core message if I was

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:90%
unwilling to do it.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:90%
So it really is true.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Every New Year's Eve, instead
of writing out my resolutions

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.264 align:middle line:84%
and goals, I write
out my dreams.

00:17:52.264 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You do?

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: I do.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
year, I reflect back,

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.907 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always grateful and
delighted that many of them

00:17:57.907 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:90%
have happened.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
haven't happened,

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I question how
committed I am to them.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a believer that if you
have lingering dreams year in,

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
year out, either do
them or dump them.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Because that
activates the doubter.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:84%
If I'm forever saying that
I'm going to write a book

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to get down
to some ridiculous size

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that I know I'm never going to
be or I'm going to go somewhere

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that I never do anything about
it, that sucks out my energy,

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:84%
it takes up psychic space, and
it sends a message to myself

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.284 align:middle line:84%
that I'm saying something and
not doing anything about it.

00:18:32.284 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Do you write these down
and then you look back at them?

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: A year later.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You do?

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.155 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Where do you
write them, in a journal?

00:18:37.155 --> 00:18:38.738 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I'll put
them in a journal.

00:18:38.738 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, for long-term
dreams or big dreams,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
like retirement dreams
or million dollar dreams,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:84%
it's really important that we
turn the dreams into projects.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I recommend projects
that can easily

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:84%
be accomplished in
one month or less,

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because a month is a short
enough period of time where you

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
can stay passionate and excited,
but a long enough period

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
of time where you
can produce a result.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We need to see that we're
progressing and accomplishing

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
results in order
to stay inspired.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'll often break
my dreams down.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I am so overdue
writing a new book,

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and I finally made a commitment
to my own mastermind group.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.805 align:middle line:84%
I'm the leader of
the mastermind group,

00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:16.679 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well,
what are you working on?

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:18.825 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if you tell
someone else your dream,

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
you're like 1,000 times
more likely to do something

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Why?

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Because of accountability?

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Accountability.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah, yeah.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.691 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Which is
why coaching has become

00:19:25.691 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:90%
a multibillion-dollar industry.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So even me, if I tell you
and declare to everyone

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I am writing a new book,
oh, gosh, now I really

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:90%
have to do it.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.281 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:19:35.281 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So within one month,
I'm writing out the table

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:90%
of contents.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Within a month after
that, I'm going

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to find somebody to help
me write the proposal.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Because for two years, I'd
been not writing the proposal.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you can identify where
you're stuck and sabotaging

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
yourself and get
somebody to help you,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:90%
more likely to move forward.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.846 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's a
perfect example.

00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So then do you say by
this date in February,

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:90%
or do you just say two months?

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.313 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: No.

00:20:00.313 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:90%
I set a very specific date.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You do?

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Because otherwise,
we'll just keep moving

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.472 align:middle line:90%
the date.

00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And we'll think this
ambiguous two months happens.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:07.638 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Right.

00:20:07.638 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Sometime in the future.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you put
it in your calendar.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: I do.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.935 align:middle line:84%
And I actually put the
due date on the calendar.

00:20:11.935 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Ah, that
makes it happen.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And then if
the date comes and I

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
haven't accomplished it, well,
then I can acknowledge it and I

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.950 align:middle line:84%
can say, how important
is this to me?

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Am I really serious about it?

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all
busy, but the ability

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:84%
to say no more to
what's no longer true

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.430 align:middle line:84%
or what's sucking
the life out of you

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
or what you're
complaining about,

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that opens up space for now
what's really important to me.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's part of the
process of turning your life

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:90%
right-side-up.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I know we're going to talk
about the Passion Pyramid here

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.322 align:middle line:90%
in a bit.

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But turning your
life right-side-up

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
means that you're living the
expression of what you love.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Every day you're waking up,
and you're creating your life

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
consciously, as opposed to just
reacting and responding to it.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So a simple question
that every morning I do

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:84%
is, what will make
me happy today?

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So what
did you do today?

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I knew I was
coming here see you.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking
forward to it.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I
stepped out on my balcony

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:84%
in beautiful Beverly
Hills this morning.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:90%
It was sunny and warm.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.809 align:middle line:84%
I've been down with that crazy
respiratory flu, and I thought,

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:12.850 align:middle line:90%
what would make me happy?

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.155 align:middle line:84%
And the dogs were like--
[PANTING] And I thought,

00:21:15.155 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
the dogs for a walk.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, nice.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.651 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I'm going to get a
warm chocolate chip cookie over

00:21:19.651 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
at Sprinkles.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:90%
That was my morning.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's nice.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And it's
the little things.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But the willingness to
even ask the question.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we're so filled
up that we don't even

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:84%
have the bandwidth to imagine
plopping one more thing down

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
on our life, we're
not living our life.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that's because
we haven't said no to things.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:90%
What is that about?

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:90%
What is the yes person?

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm that way, too.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, I'll do it.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Sure, yes, OK.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I can handle that,
one more thing.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just I'll get it over with.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.343 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:21:48.343 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.221 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Well, different
things for different people.

00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I know for myself
feeling like I always

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:84%
had to say yes was I was
afraid of disappointing others.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Because, for me, disappointing
is painful for myself.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I always like feeling a
little bit significant.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So as long as I know
that you need me,

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:90%
it lifts me up a little bit.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So I think that any of
us that are on this path,

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to be great teachers, we have to
be great students and hopefully

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:84%
students of consciousness
work and that we

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
take the time to
ask good questions,

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to reflect, to put the
personal practices in place.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And hands down, the most
powerful thing for me

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:84%
really has been to learn
how to say, no, thank you,

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:84%
without any justification,
rational, or explanation.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:29.715 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Or anger.

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes when
you get on that no,

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.674 align:middle line:90%
you're like no. [GROANS]

00:22:32.674 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, it gets easier.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And as busy as I
am-- and this is

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:84%
going to sound a
little braggadocious.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Is that a good
word, braggadocious?

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.093 align:middle line:90%
Braggalicious?

00:22:43.093 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Make it up.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: As busy
as I am, I have time,

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and I have free time,
and I have a life.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And people tell me
I look 20 years--

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's
not braggadocious--

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: --younger now.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.725 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --at all.

00:22:53.725 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:90%
That's admirable.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I'll tell
you the gift of it.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.854 align:middle line:10%
>> WIEDER: Two weeks ago, a
young gal that I met through

00:22:58.854 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:10%
the Make-A-Wish Foundation--
I'm on the board,

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.853 align:middle line:10%
and it's such a privilege.

00:23:01.853 --> 00:23:05.322 align:middle line:10%
And last week I did a fundraiser
for them, and I loved it.

00:23:05.322 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:10%
I bought the wine and cheese.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.446 align:middle line:10%
I bought the crackers.

00:23:07.446 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:90%
I gave my time.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
We raised thousands
of dollars, and I

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
felt like I made $100,000
because I just-- it

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
was so wonderful to have time,
energy, and money to give.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Love that.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Highly recommend it.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
gals that I met,

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
a 15-year-old girl
with cystic fibrosis,

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Claire, who has
her own foundation

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
called Claire's Place,
which is about teaching

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
kids and families to
thrive, not just survive

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:90%
with cystic fibrosis.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, Claire's had
over 30 operations.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.332 align:middle line:90%
She's 15 years old.

00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, wow.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: She walks around with
an oxygen tank and tubes up her

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:41.169 align:middle line:90%
nose.

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And she called me up two
weeks ago, and she said,

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I've been invited
to give a TED talk.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me prepare?

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah, sure.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.440 align:middle line:90%
When is it?

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:90%
She said, Sunday.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.555 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:51.872 align:middle line:90%
I was able to be available.

00:23:51.872 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:90%
And she came over to my home.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:90%
She showed me her PowerPoint.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I got her to throw
the PowerPoint away.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I taught her how to set context.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
She says brilliant things
out of her own mouth,

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
like God gave me a short life,
so I have no time to waste.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:90%
What's your excuse?

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.583 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ooh.

00:24:08.583 --> 00:24:09.082 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:24:09.082 --> 00:24:10.225 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: And she's so dynamic.

00:24:10.225 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you
saw that in her.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.803 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Oh, I love her.

00:24:12.803 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:84%
She got the only standing
ovation of the morning

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:90%
from all these TED talks.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I was
available on a moment's notice

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to be of service, to have that
level of joy to contribute,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.500 align:middle line:90%
that's how I want my life to be.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.291 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's it.

00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So I was on track
last year to grow my business

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:30.780 align:middle line:90%
by five times.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.689 align:middle line:84%
And I was unhappy,
I was stressed,

00:24:32.689 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I was waking up in the
middle of the night,

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and I finally said,
what am I doing?

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.285 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to grow a
$10 million business.

00:24:38.285 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I'm happy to
have a lifestyle business,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what I value most.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:84%
This whole dream conversation
is about getting in touch

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:90%
with what matters to you.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:90%
What do you really care about?

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:90%
What's really important to you?

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:84%
What dream must you
accomplish before you

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
die in order to die
happy and fulfilled?

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
how do you want

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:84%
to live every single
day of your life?

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah, your calling.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And when you
develop the muscle to say, no,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
thank you to what's no longer
true and the courage to live

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and to be an example to your
friends and loved ones that

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:84%
life is about living--
I think we forget that.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.787 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That is
absolutely true,

00:25:15.787 --> 00:25:17.120 align:middle line:90%
especially if you have children.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you're working
so hard all the time

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're stressed
all the time,

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.940 align:middle line:84%
your child's not going to ever
have a good impression of work.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.305 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yes.

00:25:24.305 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And then you're
going to pass that down,

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
work hard and hate it.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.730 align:middle line:84%
You're modeling constantly
as a parent as well.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Constantly.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So are you demonstrating
to your children

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.126 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
for your dreams?

00:25:34.126 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Are you showing your
kids what a dream

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
come true looks like, which
includes that kind of quality

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.880 align:middle line:84%
time and love, energy,
time-- I'll say it again--

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.431 align:middle line:84%
that kind of time for what
really matters to you most?

00:25:45.431 --> 00:25:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So then when you
have demons come up

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:54.760 align:middle line:84%
or story comes out that
gets you off that path,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a
look at Marcia teaching.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.599 align:middle line:84%
This is the Passion
Pyramid, right?

00:25:58.599 --> 00:25:59.265 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:25:59.265 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:84%
This is about
bringing more of what

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.584 align:middle line:84%
you love into your
everyday life.

00:26:02.584 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Your essence.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.458 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And turning
your life right-side-up.

00:26:05.458 --> 00:26:06.776 align:middle line:90%
Let's Take a look at this.

00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:07.442 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: The
question simply is,

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.290 align:middle line:90%
how do I want my life to be?

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:16.000 align:middle line:84%
How do I want my life to be
is a confronting question,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:84%
because if you're someone
who practices living

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:84%
with integrity, dreamtime,
aboriginals, someone who

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.500 align:middle line:84%
practices living with integrity,
after you ask the question how

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:84%
do I want my life to be,
the next question must be,

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.556 align:middle line:84%
and what am I willing
to do about it?

00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
What am I willing
to do about it?

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.002 align:middle line:84%
So I drew this little
graphic the other day,

00:26:37.002 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
but I'll put it
back up here again,

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:90%
because I think it's so useful.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:10%
We call this the
Passion Pyramid.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:10%
And the bottom of
this is your purpose.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Then we move into dreams-- how
do you want your life to be?--

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.162 align:middle line:84%
projects-- how are we going to
move forward on the dreams?--

00:26:54.162 --> 00:26:55.495 align:middle line:90%
and then we get into scheduling.

00:26:55.495 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Most of us live our
lives from the top down.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.710 align:middle line:10%
Something happens, you
go to your calendar

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:10%
to see where you
can jam one more

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.260 align:middle line:10%
thing into an
overscheduled life.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:10%
What I would like to
teach you and offer to you

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:12.460 align:middle line:10%
is that you can turn
your life right-side-up.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:10%
Standing in your purpose, you
ask the question, who am I?

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:10%
That's purpose.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:10%
Who am I?

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:10%
Why am I here?

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
How do I want my life to be,
personally and professionally?

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Where dreams come from
is you make them up.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are based on need.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
based on desire.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
The dreams that come
from your purpose

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.040 align:middle line:90%
are usually the most profound.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.635 align:middle line:90%
And, without purpose--

00:27:37.635 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'll be asked to
come into a corporation.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, yeah, we want
to pay you a lot of money

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.350 align:middle line:90%
to deliver a keynote.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Can you skip that purpose stuff?

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.696 align:middle line:10%
Well, without purpose,
people often climb

00:27:47.696 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:10%
to the top of the
mountain and discover

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.320 align:middle line:10%
it's the wrong mountain.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So we want to turn your
life right-side-up.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead of living and reacting
to your clocks and calendars,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:90%
we want to live more on purpose.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
you've attained

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
this when someday soon when you
open your calendar what you'll

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
see scheduled are the activities
that are moving you forward

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
on your dreams that are all
the expression of your purpose.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:90%
And purpose is a guiding light.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.023 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:19.023 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: So that is a great
way to get yourself reconnected

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:10%
with your essence.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:10%
But what about when the
dreams don't work out?

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.220 align:middle line:10%
What happens when they get
crushed or you lose money?

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:10%
>> WIEDER: What people
call the dreaded doubter.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:31.803 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:28:31.803 --> 00:28:34.740 align:middle line:10%
>> WIEDER: So if you turn the
voice of the doubter down,

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.224 align:middle line:10%
it becomes the realist, right?

00:28:36.224 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:10%
And the realist wants
to know what's the plan.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.223 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: Pretty much, yep.

00:28:39.223 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:10%
>> WIEDER: But before
we turn it down,

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.440 align:middle line:10%
how about we hear from it?

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Because what I believe
is that every part of us

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:90%
serves a sacred function.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So what's the sacred
function of the doubter?

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Your doubter will give you
your list of obstacles.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Evidence.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.279 align:middle line:84%
And to show you why
and where it is.

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So wherever
there's an obstacle,

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
we can design a strategy
for getting there.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
every obstacle comes

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.850 align:middle line:84%
in one or both of
these two flavors.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
It's either an
internal job, something

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that you believe
about yourself, life,

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.270 align:middle line:84%
or your dream-- I'm
not good enough.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm too old.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the money-- or
it's an external job, something

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that requires a
strategy or a plan.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:18.870 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's both.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So if your dream is to start
or grow your own business,

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and maybe your obstacle is
you don't have enough money

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.060 align:middle line:90%
or you don't know how.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know how, you can
learn, you can hire a mentor,

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.112 align:middle line:84%
you can trade and
barter with someone

00:29:32.112 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
the money to hire

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:90%
somebody, lots of strategies.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
the day, if you

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
have a whole list of
strategies and you still

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.680 align:middle line:84%
don't believe in yourself,
probably an internal piece of

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:90%
So a couple of things.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
One is our attitudes and
beliefs are never neutral.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are aware they either
move us forward or hold us

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But what a lot of
us, myself included,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:58.370 align:middle line:84%
often forget is we can choose
what we're going to believe.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:90%
So the question is this.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
This is what my whole Dream
University is founded on.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you choose to
believe in your dream

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.950 align:middle line:84%
not because there are promises,
guarantees, or assurances

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:84%
but simply because
it matters to you?

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Can you believe
enough in something

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.790 align:middle line:84%
because it matters to you that
you'll do something about it,

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:90%
that you'll share the dream?

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is, Lisa, and everything

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:84%
gets all gnarled
up together, right.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I start to get
insecure, so I don't

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:84%
want to tell anybody
about my dream.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Now I keep it such
a good secret that I

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.880 align:middle line:84%
start to forget about
it, when the person who's

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:84%
sitting right next to me
might be the very person who's

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.130 align:middle line:84%
looking for my kind
of idea to invest in.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And we kill off our
dreams before we

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.504 align:middle line:90%
explore the possibilities.

00:30:41.504 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, at what point
to you realize, though,

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.290 align:middle line:90%
that it might not work?

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Well, I think
if you've given your dream

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:84%
your all and you really feel
like nothing is happening,

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:84%
you've got to take
a little inventory.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Am my consciously or
unconsciously sabotaging this?

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Or is it really not
the right dream for me?

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:02.510 align:middle line:84%
As I said, most of us need
to see some kind of result

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.635 align:middle line:90%
in order to stay motivated.

00:31:03.635 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I have this funny little thing
that I like to say, though.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
If you have not dealt
with your own doubt

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and you meet another
doubter on the road,

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.510 align:middle line:90%
their doubt will magnify yours.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Your own, yes.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: But if you've
dealt with your own doubt--

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.325 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk a little bit
more about how to do that--

00:31:18.325 --> 00:31:19.824 align:middle line:84%
if you've dealt
with your own doubt,

00:31:19.824 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and you meet another
doubter on the road,

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
by contrast it becomes
the opportunity to deepen

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:84%
your commitment and your
conviction to your dream.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.810 align:middle line:84%
What that means is can you
talk to anyone, anytime,

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:84%
anyplace about your vision and,
regardless of what comes back

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.850 align:middle line:84%
at you, stay committed
and convicted

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.140 align:middle line:90%
to it by taking action?

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Not enough to click your
heels together three times,

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.909 align:middle line:84%
I do believe, I do
believe, I do believe, not

00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:47.825 align:middle line:84%
enough to be thinking
about it, talking about,

00:31:47.825 --> 00:31:48.900 align:middle line:90%
it, dreaming about it.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.675 align:middle line:84%
It's your taking action on
it that inspires people.

00:31:52.675 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So I have a friend
who has a toy business.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And he has a story
that the toy industry has taken

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:84%
a dive since the recession,
nobody's putting money

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.421 align:middle line:84%
into toys anymore, but yet
he's still trying to run his

00:32:06.421 --> 00:32:06.920 align:middle line:90%
business.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But he's got this
massive story running

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:84%
that there's no longer
money in the toy business.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Yeah, well, his
story will perpetuate the myth.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes, it has.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I have a
favorite saying, old story,

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:22.000 align:middle line:90%
time for new game.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes when we're
inside of something

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:84%
we can't actually even
see how insidious it is.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.835 align:middle line:84%
So his lens is
this doesn't work.

00:32:30.835 --> 00:32:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: So
everything he's doing--

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Is not working.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --is the
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it may require a new
model and new ways of doing it,

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and that's where a coach--
not me, but a coach who

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.094 align:middle line:84%
can effectively hold him,
help him create a new vision.

00:32:46.094 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
We're hosting this big
conference called the Wealthy

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.499 align:middle line:90%
Visionary Conference.

00:32:49.499 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have said to
me, well, I'm not wealthy,

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.570 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not a visionary.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, that's why
you need to come.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Wealthy is a mindset.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Visionary is your
ability to dream again.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us have
lost that ability.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling you--
I've said it before.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I'll say it again--
I truly believe

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:84%
it's never been a better
or more important time.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And those of us that will
continue to make up dreams

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're passionate
about, take the big dream,

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.030 align:middle line:84%
break it down into
projects, articulate it

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:19.120 align:middle line:84%
with clarity and passion,
and inspire other people

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to join us, we
will get traction.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And the truth of it
is, if you're doing all

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.957 align:middle line:84%
that, nothing's happening,
nothing's happening,

00:33:25.957 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:90%
well, maybe it's not your dream.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.414 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's somebody else's.

00:33:28.414 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's a
deciding moment.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.610 align:middle line:84%
That's right there
a deciding moment.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Most
people quit too soon.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I was going
to ask you about that.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people call
into my radio show and say,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I've lost my purpose.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.344 align:middle line:90%
I've lost my path.

00:33:38.344 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Well,
that's different.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.615 align:middle line:90%
For me, purpose is who you are.

00:33:41.615 --> 00:33:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.156 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And you can
rediscover your purpose

00:33:44.156 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:90%
by going on a passion quest.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.405 align:middle line:84%
Take some time to ask
the important questions.

00:33:47.405 --> 00:33:48.649 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:90%
What matters to me?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.160 align:middle line:90%
What do I love?

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:90%
What do I care about?

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.070 align:middle line:84%
What even angers
and frustrates me?

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Look at Mothers
Against Drunk Driving.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Great things can come out
of anger and frustration.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.390 align:middle line:84%
But for a lot of
us, because we've

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.340 align:middle line:84%
been so busy focusing on
paying the bills and survival

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and raising our children and
in that reality conversation,

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.300 align:middle line:84%
many of us have lost our
ability, so we think, to dream.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.537 align:middle line:90%
So start small.

00:34:11.537 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Make up something
that matters to you.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just
having a joyful day.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Start to heal and nurture
the dreamer inside of you

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:84%
so you can open up to
that childlike quality

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.690 align:middle line:84%
of creativity, imagination, and
then bring your adult person

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get out
there and make it happen.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.840 align:middle line:90%
But don't give up too soon.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.309 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So is that why you
created the Dream University?

00:34:34.309 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Is that why you
created it, so that you

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.880 align:middle line:84%
could make coaches
and help other people

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:90%
through the coaching programs?

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.655 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, Lisa, when
I announced to people

00:34:42.655 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:84%
that I was closing my
marketing and media

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:84%
business in the National Press
Building in Washington, DC

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to move to California to
start Dream University,

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.461 align:middle line:90%
they thought I'd lost my mind.

00:34:52.461 --> 00:34:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But I really saw that there
was a need that there were

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that were
unhappy and unfulfilled

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and that were frustrated,
and I was one of them.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And I just started to really
feel and experience the joy

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:84%
of helping another
person at a basic level.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you were doing a
high-powered marketing business

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.250 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, DC, coaching
presidents, basically,

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and the whole professional
CEO suit thing.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Not happy.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.740 align:middle line:84%
I walked out in
the street in DC.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.657 align:middle line:90%
I was in a purple silk jumpsuit.

00:35:19.657 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:90%
I looked up and down the street.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.384 align:middle line:84%
I was the only
person wearing color.

00:35:23.384 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I'm
thinking purple silk.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: The only other
color around were the cherry

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.374 align:middle line:90%
blossoms, you know?

00:35:28.374 --> 00:35:28.915 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:35:28.915 --> 00:35:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: But I asked
that confronting question.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.940 align:middle line:90%
How do I want my life to be?

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.612 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was very
different than how it was.

00:35:35.612 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
make up this dream

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of living in a cosmopolitan
city near the water

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:43.405 align:middle line:84%
where it didn't snow, being paid
well for doing what I loved--

00:35:43.405 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what it
was at that time-- being

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:84%
in a healthy relationship
with a man who adored me.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.027 align:middle line:90%
I'm still looking for that one.

00:35:51.027 --> 00:35:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: She's a fireball.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I promised myself I'd
be sharing that with the world,

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.990 align:middle line:90%
so I'm being true to myself.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.057 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's good.

00:35:58.057 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: The dream of being
paid well for doing what I

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.215 align:middle line:84%
love, a lot of people
don't think it's possible.

00:36:02.215 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.213 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: A lot of people have
the you have to suffer to sing

00:36:05.213 --> 00:36:08.690 align:middle line:84%
the blues, or I'm spiritual, and
therefore I can't make money.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:12.880 align:middle line:84%
We need wealth to accomplish
the important transformation

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that the world needs
from us right now.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.730 align:middle line:84%
We need philanthropic
people in order

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.760 align:middle line:84%
to be generous and
contribute and to really

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:84%
help transform the landscape
of what the world looks like.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.575 align:middle line:84%
And I intend to be
one of those people.

00:36:24.575 --> 00:36:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So you be generous
where you can.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I did this evening
of laser coaching,

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and all the money went to
the Make-A-Wish Foundation,

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and I came away feeling
really rich and abundant out

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.100 align:middle line:84%
of just contributing
and volunteering.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And so are you able
to look at somebody's job

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:84%
or mission or passion or
whatever it is and just turn it

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.271 align:middle line:90%
into reality really fast?

00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:49.242 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I am great at helping
people-- I see potential,

00:36:49.242 --> 00:36:51.575 align:middle line:84%
I see where people are out
of integrity with their soul,

00:36:51.575 --> 00:36:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and I'm able to quickly
help people design brilliant

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.880 align:middle line:84%
shortcuts in order to catapult
their business or their life

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.380 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:36:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: It's a gift.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It is.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I don't know
where I got it from.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I'm
very, very blessed.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.413 align:middle line:90%
So people pay me a lot of money.

00:37:04.413 --> 00:37:05.760 align:middle line:90%
They come to Beverly Hills.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.770 align:middle line:84%
They spend an
entire day with me.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:84%
We find their purpose,
clarify their dreams,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.835 align:middle line:84%
and then really look at a
whole branding conversation

00:37:12.835 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:84%
for how they can bring it
out in the world in a way

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.980 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be paid
and compensated for it.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.812 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's interesting.

00:37:18.812 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Along the conversation
of branding,

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.120 align:middle line:84%
how do you take a
brand that has gone

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:84%
south or something
went wrong with it

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.370 align:middle line:84%
or there was a contamination
in the food product

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
or there's so many
different situations where

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.890 align:middle line:90%
you have a bruise in the brand--

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I think
it's about a new dream.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
about a Band-Aid.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's about
just fixing what's wrong.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more
energy in moving

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.800 align:middle line:84%
toward a vision and
a creation process

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.390 align:middle line:84%
than there is around moving
away from a problem or issue.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think for a company
to really get honest,

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to be really revealing and
transparent about what they did

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.540 align:middle line:84%
wrong, apologize, do whatever
they need to clean it up,

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.984 align:middle line:84%
and then really create a
vision that's appropriate.

00:38:01.984 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I was thinking
about Lance Armstrong,

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.481 align:middle line:84%
who's done so much
in the world for--

00:38:05.481 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: So much good.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --cancer patients.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The world is a
different place because of his

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.779 align:middle line:84%
awareness that he's brought
with the Livestrong brand.

00:38:11.779 --> 00:38:13.405 align:middle line:84%
But yet he's got this
tainted image now

00:38:13.405 --> 00:38:15.445 align:middle line:84%
with the doping and
everything and the story that

00:38:15.445 --> 00:38:16.340 align:middle line:90%
goes along with that.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.220 align:middle line:84%
How do you keep this
thing that really

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:84%
helps transform cancer
patients and override that?

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.830 align:middle line:84%
He's doing the
accountability thing.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:26.496 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:38:26.496 --> 00:38:28.765 align:middle line:84%
I think he's being very
courageous about it, actually.

00:38:28.765 --> 00:38:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about Martha
Stewart as you were talking--

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.764 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:38:31.764 --> 00:38:33.777 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --these
comeback kings and queens.

00:38:33.777 --> 00:38:34.360 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.040 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:90%
We screw up.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And what an extraordinary
initiation for him

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.280 align:middle line:84%
as a human being, that he
rose to the top of the top.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness that he
used his star quality

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.324 align:middle line:84%
to create so much
awareness, so much healing.

00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: There's a lot of
pressure up there with all

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:50.662 align:middle line:90%
the sponsors.

00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:51.870 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot riding upon it.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:52.959 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Absolutely.

00:38:52.959 --> 00:38:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Literally.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: There's
no right or wrong.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.860 align:middle line:90%
We make mistakes.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it's all about
how do we deal with it.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And that's an
interesting thing when you said

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:90%
that we're human.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Because we make mistakes.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.300 align:middle line:84%
They just make mistakes in
a bigger visibility way.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Right.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And if you can really
have compassion maybe for that

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:84%
person and not make
it like a witch hunt--

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.281 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Well, isn't
that how projection works?

00:39:13.281 --> 00:39:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The reaction we're
having out there

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.780 align:middle line:90%
is really something about me.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.060 align:middle line:90%
So how am I like that?

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.710 align:middle line:90%
How do I do that to myself?

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I can find
compassion for his mistakes,

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.122 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to certainly have
more compassion for myself.

00:39:25.122 --> 00:39:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.622 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
different things like that.

00:39:28.622 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:84%
We've seen many different
people, presidents, saying,

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:34.230 align:middle line:84%
no, I did not sleep with that
woman, and it comes out later.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Oops.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And where there's
just out, out lies,

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.202 align:middle line:90%
but we're not in their shoes.

00:39:40.202 --> 00:39:42.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the pressure
that's happening up there.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.951 align:middle line:84%
For all we know, we have to say
that to save a family member.

00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:45.540 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Let's be
accountable for ourselves.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Let's do that.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:50.113 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Each of us can
do the best that we can.

00:39:50.113 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:90%
We're going to screw up.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Clean it up as quickly
as you possibly can.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, maybe you don't
have to screw it up, though.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you can get to--

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Even better.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: --that place of being
accountable to yourself before

00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.897 align:middle line:90%
you screw it up.

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:01.938 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Yeah, catch
yourself before you do it.

00:40:01.938 --> 00:40:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: If something comes
out of my mouth, like I say,

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:84%
oh, sure, and then I'm thinking,
I'm never going to do that,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I try in the moment
to say, you know,

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I know I said yes
because I care about you,

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.130 align:middle line:84%
but the truth of
it is I just can't.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.260 align:middle line:90%
And I just want to--

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Good for you.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --be
reasonable about it.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.233 align:middle line:84%
And I think, like you said,
the earlier we can catch it,

00:40:19.233 --> 00:40:21.670 align:middle line:84%
the earlier we can clean it
up, hopefully before we even

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.777 align:middle line:84%
screw up, the world
becomes a better place.

00:40:23.777 --> 00:40:25.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's really the big dream.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It takes practice.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:26.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.301 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And look,
you and I in our work,

00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:30.030 align:middle line:84%
we're here to create
heaven on Earth.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's about joy.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I think we were created
to live a life of joy,

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:84%
love, and abundance,
and we have forgotten.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.321 align:middle line:84%
We've become really
good problem solvers,

00:40:39.321 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and then we've become
really good problem makers

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.760 align:middle line:84%
so we have problems
to solve, as opposed

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.510 align:middle line:84%
to remembering that we
are creators as well.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And we have an opportunity to
create the life for ourselves,

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:53.486 align:middle line:84%
our loved ones, and the world
in general by doing the best

00:40:53.486 --> 00:40:54.360 align:middle line:90%
that we possibly can.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I always am very
conscious about having too much

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.720 align:middle line:84%
of an enlightened conversation
to say that we're here having

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.430 align:middle line:90%
all the answers.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:84%
We are figuring it out and have
been focusing on figuring it

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.900 align:middle line:84%
out so that our time of learning
maybe is a little shorter,

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:84%
or we could get over those
types of things a little faster.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.430 align:middle line:84%
But then there's the
next mountain to climb.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very
important to have

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.110 align:middle line:84%
this conversation for anyone
who has ever stepped in the mud

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and maybe tarnished their brand
or not fulfilled their purpose

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.477 align:middle line:90%
or went the wrong direction--

00:41:22.477 --> 00:41:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Made a mistake.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: --bad
investments, it happens.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Absolutely.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.391 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:41:26.391 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take another
look at Marcia Wieder in action

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:29.860 align:middle line:90%
on stage.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.360 align:middle line:84%
You really are a
prolific speaker.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.604 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:41:32.604 --> 00:41:33.270 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:34.917 align:middle line:10%
>> WIEDER: It's a big concept.

00:41:34.917 --> 00:41:37.000 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not going to get
all psychological on you,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.060 align:middle line:10%
but for some of you this
will be a game-changer.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I teach is
based on opinion or experience,

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and I don't have to be right.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:53.716 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
we're born as essence.

00:41:53.716 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:84%
How many of you believe
that we're born as essence?

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Can I just see?

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And you might use a
different word for essence.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.960 align:middle line:84%
You might have your own
expression of what that is.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But we're born as
essence, right?

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Early in life-- [SINGING]--
you are wounded.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.286 align:middle line:84%
[SINGING] It's
supposed to happen.

00:42:14.286 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It's how you-- I don't
know what's going on.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.330 align:middle line:90%
It's late.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Sound effects.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.078 align:middle line:90%
Whoo hoo.

00:42:21.078 --> 00:42:22.410 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to happen.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It's what gets you to
individuate from mother.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.650 align:middle line:84%
We start to discover
ourselves as other.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:29.860 align:middle line:90%
We're wounded.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where it
gets interesting.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Out of our wound, what comes
in is this big protector.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
the protector's job

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.100 align:middle line:90%
is to protect the wounded child.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a good setup,
except that protector

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:53.010 align:middle line:84%
gets inflated, gets
bigger, gets powerful.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, it
turns into your critic.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
a strong critic,

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.680 align:middle line:84%
catches you doing
things right and wrong?

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And here's what
happens with this.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.160 align:middle line:84%
What started out to
be a P for Protector

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:09.930 align:middle line:84%
now becomes your personality,
and it's caught up

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:84%
with your identity,
and it's all based

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:20.890 align:middle line:84%
on a story told by
a wounded child.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.290 align:middle line:90%
And we call this adulthood.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:24.880 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the cool part.

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I love this part.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.264 align:middle line:84%
This is going to relate
to your decisions

00:43:30.264 --> 00:43:31.680 align:middle line:84%
about your life
and your business,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.721 align:middle line:90%
so just give me a minute.

00:43:32.721 --> 00:43:34.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll pull it all together.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.020 align:middle line:84%
At midlife-- which
is not a number,

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.990 align:middle line:84%
but it's a mindset--
at midlife, we

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:84%
start to ask questions
like, who am I?

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:90%
How do I want my life to be?

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:84%
What if my story
isn't the whole story?

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And at midlife,
when we're ready,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.250 align:middle line:84%
when we're mature enough
inside of our ourselves

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.840 align:middle line:84%
to do work like this,
we're high enough up

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.660 align:middle line:84%
on the Maslow's
hierarchy-- we've got food,

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:84%
we've got shelter, we
can afford to be asking

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:09.666 align:middle line:84%
provocative, self-reflective,
deep questions-- at midlife,

00:44:09.666 --> 00:44:12.270 align:middle line:90%
we start the journey back.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:16.530 align:middle line:84%
We go back through and go, oh,
this can't be all that it is.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.300 align:middle line:90%
This is part of who I am.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this story is
part of who I am.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back
through as a mature adult,

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.930 align:middle line:84%
pick up what's called the
disowned or lost parts

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.850 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, and, for many
of us, it's our dreamer.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.400 align:middle line:84%
For many of us, it's our
creativity, our imagination,

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.690 align:middle line:84%
our risk-taking, our
courageous get out of way,

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:37.182 align:middle line:90%
I'm going for it.

00:44:37.182 --> 00:44:38.890 align:middle line:84%
We lost some of that
when we got wounded,

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.460 align:middle line:84%
because we're afraid
of getting hurt.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.650 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of failing.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are
with me on this?

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Can I see?

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.110 align:middle line:90%
You guys are terrific.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do is we
want to make the journey back,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.440 align:middle line:84%
integrate the story
into all of who we are,

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.410 align:middle line:84%
start to question
who am I really,

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.960 align:middle line:84%
go back and reclaim the wounded
and lost parts of ourselves

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.830 align:middle line:90%
to get back to essence.

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:05.100 align:middle line:90%
And then life changes.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.530 align:middle line:90%
And I do believe it's a journey.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
a linear process.

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
like, oh, I've arrived.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Woo hoo.

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I practice something I call
everyday enlightenment,

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.060 align:middle line:90%
everyday enlightenment.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Spend more time in the light
connected to your dreams,

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.840 align:middle line:84%
your hopes your
aspirations, less time

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.180 align:middle line:84%
in the dark being
hijacked by your doubter

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and your limiting
beliefs, and practice

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:26.650 align:middle line:90%
living a virtuous life.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:29.075 align:middle line:84%
And the highest
virtue is integrity.

00:45:29.075 --> 00:45:30.910 align:middle line:90%
It kind of circles all back.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:35.575 align:middle line:84%
So what does this all have
to do with being an expert?

00:45:35.575 --> 00:45:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Life orchestrated
the entire thing.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.600 align:middle line:84%
What if the grand
master essence, whatever

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that is for you, created
the wound for you

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:53.670 align:middle line:84%
to become who you've become,
the expert that you are?

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:56.100 align:middle line:84%
To live on purpose
requires three things.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.260 align:middle line:84%
One is that you have a
spiritual practice so you

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
can hear the deeper
wisdom beneath the ego.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Number two is you know what's
unique and special about you,

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:07.460 align:middle line:84%
formed by your wound,
by your stories.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And number three, you find
a way to be of service.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're here
to do as experts, really.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So many of you are
smiling at me right now.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.150 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are
having a deep appreciation

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:22.562 align:middle line:84%
for your wound and
your story right now?

00:46:22.562 --> 00:46:23.406 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You really have
helped so many people.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.200 align:middle line:84%
You have the gift of--
you're an orator, aren't you?

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Oh.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You do.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.450 align:middle line:90%
It just comes out.

>> WIEDER: I like to talk.

00:46:31.147 --> 00:46:31.813 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You do.

00:46:31.813 --> 00:46:32.640 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So you launched a campaign,
a Million Dreams Campaign.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.105 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:46:37.105 --> 00:46:37.771 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yeah.

00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:41.240 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
audacious dreams.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:43.192 align:middle line:90%
My favorite Marcia quote is--

00:46:43.192 --> 00:46:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You're talking about
yourself in the third person.

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:47.149 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: That was
really terrible.

00:46:47.149 --> 00:46:48.980 align:middle line:84%
There's the dream
you have for life,

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
dream life has for you.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:53.155 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And when
they come together,

00:46:53.155 --> 00:46:54.710 align:middle line:90%
it's an extraordinary thing.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it feels to
me about this Million Dreams.

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And on one hand, it's just a
number, and it's goal-oriented,

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not really so much
about that with dreaming.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that
when enough people are

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.230 align:middle line:84%
thinking about their dreams
and acting upon their dreams,

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.155 align:middle line:90%
we really can create a shift.

00:47:13.155 --> 00:47:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's really it.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:16.220 align:middle line:84%
This dream movement is
about getting people

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.970 align:middle line:84%
away from just thinking
about their dreams

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and talking about it.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So we created the
milliondreamscampaign.com

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.126 align:middle line:90%
website.

00:47:23.126 --> 00:47:25.251 align:middle line:84%
People can also get to it
through Dream University,

00:47:25.251 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:84%
where people-- It's
absolutely free.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.170 align:middle line:84%
People can watch
inspirational videos.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:33.160 align:middle line:84%
They can post a dream
and an action step.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.127 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
that happens

00:47:35.127 --> 00:47:36.460 align:middle line:90%
when we put our dream out there.

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like when we
keep it a secret,

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:90%
even we can forget what it is.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But when we put it
out to the world,

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.020 align:middle line:84%
whether it's to share
it with our coach

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.970 align:middle line:84%
or actually put it out
there where it's registered

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:48.770 align:middle line:84%
on a site, we're much more
likely to do something

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:49.460 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So we designed a place
where people could do that.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I love that.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:53.120 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you're someone
who is just hearing

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.346 align:middle line:84%
this information for
the first time, who

00:47:56.346 --> 00:47:59.220 align:middle line:84%
came across this on Gaiam TV
and are sitting in your living

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.820 align:middle line:84%
room in your pajamas and
you're hoping nobody sees you,

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and you come across
a video like this,

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.730 align:middle line:84%
it sparks something
inside of you.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
where you are in your life,

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:11.920 align:middle line:90%
what situation you're in.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.014 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think
these are valuable.

00:48:14.014 --> 00:48:15.430 align:middle line:84%
You really touch
people with this.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And I want to just
say that sometimes people say,

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:18.540 align:middle line:90%
well, I don't have a dream.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: We can
reframe that to, OK,

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.059 align:middle line:84%
your dream is to
have a new dream.

00:48:23.059 --> 00:48:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, that's good.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: And so instead of
there's a problem to solve, OK.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Go on a passion quest.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Discover what you love, who
you are, what matters to you.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Make up a dream, even if
you start with a small one.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:35.230 align:middle line:84%
In our world at
Dream University,

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:38.260 align:middle line:84%
no dream is too big, and
no dream is too small.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.729 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what's
important to you,

00:48:40.729 --> 00:48:42.395 align:middle line:84%
and what are you
willing to do about it?

00:48:42.395 --> 00:48:45.894 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I wonder if this could
also help students going into--

00:48:45.894 --> 00:48:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Absolutely.

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --college.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: I taught for a while
at Stanford Graduate School

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.350 align:middle line:84%
for Business, and
our brightest minds,

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.900 align:middle line:84%
they were terrified of
picking the wrong dream.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Oh, my family
invested all this money,

00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and I've spent all this time.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.680 align:middle line:84%
What if I picked
the wrong thing?

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what if you
use passion as your barometer

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to do what you love
now and let that be

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.200 align:middle line:84%
what guides you
through your life?

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.990 align:middle line:84%
They're not being
taught that in school.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.290 align:middle line:90%
So we need to teach kids--

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You've
got a good point.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --to dream, not
just how to solve problems.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.225 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:49:15.225 --> 00:49:16.683 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: That's
one of my dreams,

00:49:16.683 --> 00:49:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to bring dreaming into
the educational system.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:19.441 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:49:19.441 --> 00:49:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
Million Dreams Campaign video.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.394 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:25.394 --> 00:49:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.069 align:middle line:10%
>>Marcia Wieder says
expressing your passion is

00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:45.360 align:middle line:10%
your best chance for happiness.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.170 align:middle line:84%
She's the author of "Doing
Less and Having More."

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: My guest Marcia
Wieder today is joining us,

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and she travels the world as
an ambassador for making dreams

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:54.820 align:middle line:90%
come real.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Please welcome dream
coach Marcia Wieder.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Please join me
in a warm welcome

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:04.310 align:middle line:84%
for the woman who is changing
the way we think and speak

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:05.175 align:middle line:90%
about our dreams.

00:50:05.175 --> 00:50:08.720 align:middle line:90%


00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.640 align:middle line:10%
>>It's not enough to be
thinking about your dreams.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to be
talking about your dreams.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.720 align:middle line:84%
You need to be doing
something about it.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you're over
here in reality

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:21.880 align:middle line:84%
with your dream over
there, with one step

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.190 align:middle line:90%
you're in action on your dreams.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:28.120 align:middle line:84%
With one step, you have new
perspective and new resources

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.670 align:middle line:84%
that weren't available when you
were over here thinking, hmm,

00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:35.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe someday when the
kids are gone or I retire

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.870 align:middle line:90%
or I have extra time or money.

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:39.310 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.300 align:middle line:90%
The world doesn't work that way.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But with one step,
you demonstrate

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to the world around
you and to yourself

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that you're not just
talking about your dream.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.390 align:middle line:84%
You're serious about
making it come true.

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It's been medically proven that
people with passion and dreams

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.720 align:middle line:84%
actually live longer,
healthier lives,

00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.900 align:middle line:90%
up to 7 to 10 years longer.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.230 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, a dear
friend of mine, Dr. Oz,

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:84%
told me that there's a
medical term for this.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:08.760 align:middle line:84%
It's actually called
apoptosis, just like it sounds.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Apoptosis is when
your brain believes

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:16.530 align:middle line:84%
you've outgrown your usefulness,
which can happen at any age.

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.705 align:middle line:84%
So we might want to be
asking ourselves, well,

00:51:18.705 --> 00:51:19.680 align:middle line:90%
what's the cure?

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.180 align:middle line:84%
What's the antidote
for this syndrome?

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Passion and dreams.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Can you believe in something
because it matters to you

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and then prove that
you really do believe

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
in it by putting a stake in the
ground, setting an intention,

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.790 align:middle line:84%
putting yourself in a right
relationship by taking action

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:37.850 align:middle line:90%
on that dream?

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Because then and only
then does it happen.

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.850 align:middle line:84%
This is all about you
being willing to take

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:47.390 align:middle line:84%
your next step and
then your next one.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you take
your next step,

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:50.590 align:middle line:84%
people relate to
you differently.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:53.230 align:middle line:84%
They see you're not just
talking about your dream.

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:55.515 align:middle line:90%
You're doing something about it.

00:51:55.515 --> 00:52:01.237 align:middle line:90%


00:52:01.237 --> 00:52:02.070 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:03.715 align:middle line:90%
So what are some of your dreams?

00:52:03.715 --> 00:52:04.940 align:middle line:90%
You've seen everybody else's.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Ah.

00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: What are some of yours?

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:06.970 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
Marcia's dreams?

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Well,
there's the big ones,

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:08.756 align:middle line:90%
and there's the little ones.

00:52:08.756 --> 00:52:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned I'm working
on a new book, finally.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.792 align:middle line:84%
I'm in development on
a television show--

00:52:12.792 --> 00:52:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You are?

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --to inspire people
all over the world to go

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.187 align:middle line:90%
for their dreams.

00:52:16.187 --> 00:52:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Good.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: It's interesting.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.858 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood, you get to learn
how to deal with disappointment

00:52:19.858 --> 00:52:21.780 align:middle line:84%
where yes doesn't
necessarily mean yes.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting stretched
in many, many new ways.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: At a personal level,
I want to meet my soulmate.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I'm going
public with that.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:35.480 align:middle line:84%
My dream right now really is
to live every day of my life

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.090 align:middle line:90%
fully.

00:52:36.090 --> 00:52:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's those kind
of esoteric dreams.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's really changed my
business and my business model.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm having a lot more free
time and a lot more available.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.540 align:middle line:84%
My dream is to be healthy,
wealthy, and wise.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.610 align:middle line:84%
My dream is to be
completely in service

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:53.729 align:middle line:84%
and help other people
achieve their dreams,

00:52:53.729 --> 00:52:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to continue to support the
good work of the Make-A-Wish

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Foundation.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that I
probably covered--

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.840 align:middle line:84%
so at a personal level,
to fall in love--

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Woah, woah, here.

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:03.135 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: --professional,
write a book, a television show.

00:53:03.135 --> 00:53:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Yeah, you've
got it covered.

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:05.444 align:middle line:84%
But that's a great
point, though.

00:53:05.444 --> 00:53:07.520 align:middle line:84%
For a Type A personality,
like yourself,

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.550 align:middle line:84%
who is very
motivated and driven,

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:15.750 align:middle line:84%
do you have to build in the
time to slow yourself down?

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Not anymore.

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.015 align:middle line:90%
It's gotten easier.

00:53:18.015 --> 00:53:20.340 align:middle line:84%
At different phases in life,
we have different energy

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.720 align:middle line:90%
and different dreams.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.840 align:middle line:84%
In our 30s and 40s,
we're initiating, right?

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.870 align:middle line:84%
In our 40s and 50s,
we're transitioning.

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Into our 50s and 60s,
we might be completing.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:31.950 align:middle line:90%
We might be--

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Enjoying.

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.033 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: We might be enjoying.

00:53:34.033 --> 00:53:36.260 align:middle line:84%
We might be grieving
a loss because we're

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.890 align:middle line:84%
no longer that
personality or identity.

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think, for me, one of the
things that's keeping me happy

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:45.050 align:middle line:84%
is really being not so
much age-appropriate but

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:46.490 align:middle line:90%
mindset-appropriate.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So when I have a lot of energy,
I'm initiating something new.

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I noticed for the
last three years

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.904 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
writing a new book.

00:53:52.904 --> 00:53:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I've written 14 of
them, but I haven't

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.366 align:middle line:84%
written a new one in
a long, long time.

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:57.865 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What's
that going to be on?

00:53:57.865 --> 00:54:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: It's really about
how vision can transform

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.520 align:middle line:84%
your business,
life, and the world.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a new message that
has been moving through me.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.930 align:middle line:90%
But the industry has changed.

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:10.290 align:middle line:84%
You asked long ago when
we started the interview

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.990 align:middle line:84%
how things changing in the
world are impacting us changing.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important that we

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:19.700 align:middle line:84%
adjust but we don't give
away all of our power

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.190 align:middle line:90%
to a story or a conversation.

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So I've been waiting
for the right message.

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.757 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you should force
yourself to write a book.

00:54:26.757 --> 00:54:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you should force
yourself to be a speaker.

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:31.620 align:middle line:84%
If you are-- if you
have a message--

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.180 align:middle line:84%
In order to be a messenger,
it helps to have a message.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.657 align:middle line:84%
In order to be a
speaker, you want

00:54:35.657 --> 00:54:36.990 align:middle line:90%
to have something to talk about.

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with writing.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I guess, as I'm
aging, gracefully hopefully,

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel happier, I feel
lighter, I feel brighter,

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's because
I've taken the time

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.840 align:middle line:84%
to go on different
passion quests,

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.970 align:middle line:84%
to ask important questions, and
to adjust my life accordingly.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I pulled the plug
this year on one

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.190 align:middle line:84%
of our biggest, most
successful profitable programs

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:03.190 align:middle line:90%
because I was tired of doing it.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:05.450 align:middle line:84%
My colleagues think
I'm out of my mind.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:06.384 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:55:06.384 --> 00:55:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But you said something
very important, though.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You said grieving
the loss of a self

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that you used to be
and to honor that self

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, that self
was appropriate for maybe

00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:17.320 align:middle line:90%
a 30-year-old.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.570 align:middle line:84%
But now that I'm in
a 50-year-old body,

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:20.707 align:middle line:90%
I need to say--

00:55:20.707 --> 00:55:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: With different needs.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
important conversation,

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.400 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to
go after looking younger

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and being inappropriate
that way to accept it.

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: When I
first moved to LA,

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.040 align:middle line:84%
a dear friend of mine took me
to dinner and we were talking

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:35.270 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:36.728 align:middle line:84%
I said, one of my
dreams is to turn

00:55:36.728 --> 00:55:40.340 align:middle line:84%
the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
into the Land of a Million

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Dreams.

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And he took my hand, and
he said to me, Marcia,

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:46.030 align:middle line:84%
you're not like
anybody else I know.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:49.265 align:middle line:10%
And my eyes teared up, and
I said, you know, I was just

00:55:49.265 --> 00:55:50.890 align:middle line:10%
thinking that I wasn't
going to make it

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:54.260 align:middle line:10%
in Hollywood because I'm
not 6 foot 25 and blond.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:55.640 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: 6 foot 25.

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: I'm 4'11".

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my 50s.

00:55:58.220 --> 00:55:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But you
stand tall, lady.

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: I stand tall.

00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You do.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Big presence.

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, but you are--
you're the model for people

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.790 align:middle line:84%
to learn from, for
many people learn from.

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate your
energy and your enthusiasm

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:10.184 align:middle line:90%
and what you talk about.

00:56:10.184 --> 00:56:11.100 align:middle line:90%
It's so inspirational.

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: You and
I are truth-tellers.

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.727 align:middle line:90%
We're really no BS kind of gals.

00:56:14.727 --> 00:56:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I'm looking in
your eyes the entire time,

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:18.724 align:middle line:84%
and I can see deep
into your soul,

00:56:18.724 --> 00:56:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's been a
beautiful journey,

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.700 align:middle line:84%
as it always is when
I speak with you.

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you're
just a soul sister.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: It's funny that we
have to get together this way.

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:25.776 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I know.

00:56:25.776 --> 00:56:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: We can't have lunch.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: We try.

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: We will.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.620 align:middle line:90%
That's our new dream.

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We tried, but I
had to take care of family--

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WIEDER: Yes.

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --who were sick.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's also important.

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:37.470 align:middle line:90%
I had to know when to say no.

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> WIEDER: Look, I'm
happy to see you anyway.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And just for the record,
we're both leaving next week.

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:43.260 align:middle line:84%
We're members of the
Transformational Leadership

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:43.799 align:middle line:90%
Council.

00:56:43.799 --> 00:56:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be on the beach
in the Caribbean with you.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:48.562 align:middle line:84%
We have nothing
to complain about.

00:56:48.562 --> 00:56:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, this is the
lady who's living your dream.

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.477 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again, Marcia.
