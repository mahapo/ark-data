00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever wondered
why certain children come

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle line:10%
into the world
with very strongly

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
defined preferences
and even skills?

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, far from
being a blank canvas

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:10%
to be programmed by
parents and society,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:10%
these babies and children
have come preprogrammed,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:10%
according to past life
researcher and family

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:10%
counselor Carol Bowman.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
After her son began
making strange statements

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and drawings, Carol felt
something unexplained

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
was at play, which launched her
into research that has extended

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
over 20 years and hundreds
of cases of children

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
revealing their past
life experiences.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Carol.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.561 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my
favorite subjects.

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know that some
people watching right now

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
have probably had experiences
with their own children

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
revealing things that's like,
where did that come from?

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Why does my child just attach
to Uncle Joe for no reason,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
from the time their
eyes popped open?

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is
something that you've

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
gone into in all of
its forms, some of them

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:84%
painful and some
of them beautiful.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And let's start with what
happened in your own life

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.800 align:middle line:90%
with your own children.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:10%
I can say my adventure started
on July 4, 1988 when my son

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:10%
Chase was five years old.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:10%
And he was a very
adventuresome child.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:10%
He was very fearless.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:10%
And on this particular day,
we had had a big party,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:10%
and we took the kids to see the
4th of July fireworks display.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And very
uncharacteristically, Chase

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
became absolutely hysterical as
soon as the loud booming sounds

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:90%
began with the fireworks.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure out
what had happened to him,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't comfort him.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So I took him home and I
rocked him in a rocking chair,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and eventually he calmed
down after about an hour.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, things
like this happen with kids.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was
overstimulated, he had

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:90%
too much sugar or something.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't immediately
read something into it.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
No, not at all,
because these things

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:90%
happen with young children.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:84%
However, a week later we went
to an indoor swimming pool

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.330 align:middle line:90%
It was a municipal pool.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as anyone
went on the diving board,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
it made this big booming,
reverberating sound.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And again, Chase became
absolutely hysterical.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
He pulled me out
of the building.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And at this point
my mind was working.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the loud noises that are
triggering this fear in him.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to talk
to him about it,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
but he really
couldn't articulate

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.740 align:middle line:90%
what was bothering him.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So as fate would have it--
and I believe everything

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
is orchestrated-- a friend of
mine who had done a past life

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
regression with me a year
before was staying with us

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
in Asheville, North Carolina,
where we were living,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and he was doing workshops
on past life regression.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And one afternoon while
Norman Ng, the hypnotherapist,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
was staying with us, I
mentioned Chase's phobia

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:84%
to him because Chase was
due to start kindergarten.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid that he would
have one of his episodes

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:90%
and they would call me.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Right and there was potential
for a lot of loud banging

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
sounds in kindergarten.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So I just didn't think it
would be a great thing.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned Chase's phobia
to Norman, thinking, well,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Norman is a hypnotherapist.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
He can give Chase some
posthypnotic suggestions so

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
the next time he's around
these big, booming sounds he's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
not going to get triggered.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I had no
idea what was going to happen.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Norman said to Chase,
sit on your mom's lap.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
He was about this
big at the time.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and tell
me what you see when you

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:90%
hear the loud booming sounds.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And immediately Chase started
talking in the first person.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I am a soldier.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm confused.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm scared.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:90%
There's smoke everywhere.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
who I'm shooting at.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, my mind
is trying to figure out

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:84%
which "Sesame
Street" episode this

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:84%
was, or "Mr. Rogers"
episode, because we

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:90%
strictly limited TV watching.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I was a stay at home mother.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:84%
He hadn't to school yet,
so I knew pretty much

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:90%
what he had been exposed to.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And he proceeded with
his story, and he said,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm crouching behind a rock,
and I have a gun, a long gun

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:90%
with a big sword at the end.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, he
doesn't even own a toy gun.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm
scared, I'm confused,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
I'm shooting at.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:90%
There's smoke everywhere.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden I'm hit.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And his body kind of
collapsed in my lap.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And Norman said,
then what happens?

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they
take me to this place.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a hospital, but it's not
like a regular hospital, which

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
was strange because Chase
wasn't even born in a hospital,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:90%
but we lived near a hospital.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's this place.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just poles with
this covering over it.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they
put me on a bed,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:90%
but it's not a regular bed.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like a hard bench.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they bandage my
wrist, where I was injured,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and they make me go
back into battle.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I miss my wife and family.
-Wow.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment,
Regina, when the goosebumps--

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.255 align:middle line:84%
when you hear your five-year-old
talk about his wife and family.

00:05:30.255 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
We must be into some
past life material

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
other explanation.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And he was very sad.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, I
miss my wife and family.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
kill other people.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So Norman, who had years of
experience working with adults

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
in past life therapy,
picked up on the fact

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that he was in some
past life material.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:90%
He was in a story.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So he said to Chase
in very simple terms,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, we play different
roles in different lifetimes.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
We come to earth and we
play different roles.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes we're soldiers.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And as soldiers, we have to
kill others or we are killed.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're just learning
what it is to be human.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
We're playing these
roles to learn.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And did it seem that Chase
understood that on some level?

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
He did, which
really surprised me.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I could tell he was
understanding because his body

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:90%
suddenly relaxed.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:90%
I was holding him.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's interesting,

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
you know, these universal
concepts are coming

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:90%
through to this five-year-old.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And that seemed
to calm him down.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And then Norman said,
well, what happens next?

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And Chase said, I'm
walking down a dusty road.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:90%
There are chickens on the road.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And I see a big
cannon on a wagon

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
with big wheels tied down
with ropes, pulled by horses.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to think,
what war is this?

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:90%
What time period are we in?

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they make
me go behind the cannon.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:90%
This is Civil War era, kind of.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Later we learned it was
the American Civil War.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
vivid in his mind.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:90%
The images were very vivid.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I go
behind the cannon.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:90%
They want me to go back.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And at that point he just opened
his eyes and hopped off my lap

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and grabbed a cookie and
went to play with his Legos.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting there
kind of shell shocked.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And my nine-year-old daughter
Sarah was sitting with us.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said to Norman,
what was that?

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, it's
probably a past life memory.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The sounds of the
4th of July fireworks

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:84%
probably triggered
the last sound

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:90%
he heard in that lifetime.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter, who is
much more astute than I am,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:84%
said, mom, that place where
Chase said he was shot

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:84%
on his wrist, where
they bandaged it,

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:90%
that's where he has his eczema.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And since Chase
had been a baby, he

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
had a chronic and severe
eczema on that spot

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:84%
on his wrist, which had not
responded to food elimination

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:90%
diets, antibiotic creams.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.630 align:middle line:90%
We tried everything, homeopathy.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's interesting,

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
somatic body memory.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So the upshot of this
15-minute or so recollection

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
was that his phobia of loud
noises completely went away.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, shortly
after this he

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:90%
asked for his first drum set.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and what's interesting
is that the person,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Ng, you said, was his name?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:10%
Norman Ng, yeah.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Had the wisdom to put
this much larger kind

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual context to it,
and trust him, even as a child,

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:90%
to innately understand that.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking
to him as a soul.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And Chase was
responding as a soul, not

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
his five-year-old self,
which is significant.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And now Chase did some
drawings along the way?

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.569 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Let me just-- the upshot of
that was that not only did

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
the phobia go away-- and
this is really important--

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
but that chronic eczema,
which had not responded

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
to medical treatment,
went away completely

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:90%
within a couple of days.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.124 align:middle line:90%
So that really was amazing.

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You were getting your
physical evidence,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and now you're thinking,
I need to really start

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%
delving into the research.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So now we have some
wonderful drawings from him.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:90%
How did they come about?

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll look
at them and we'll talk

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:90%
about them as we pull them up.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were in the middle
of a move from Asheville

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:90%
to Philadelphia at the time.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So Chase's wild experience kind
of got lost in the shuffle.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:10%
Once we had moved
to Philadelphia,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:10%
it was about six months
later, we were sitting

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:10%
and eating breakfast,
and he said that he

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:10%
remembered being a soldier.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:10%
He also talked about
being a black soldier.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And here we have one that wa--
right there, the one on top

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is his wrist that he had drawn,
where he had been injured.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:84%
By the age of seven, he was
getting more recollections.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
at age seven, he

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
remembered dying
on the battlefield

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and floating above
the battlefield.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, after he
remembered that, he said,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to draw these images
so I never forget them.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So he drew where
his wrist was shot.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And he drew a primitive
drawing of a field hospital,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:90%
what he saw as this hospital.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And this end this
table he was on.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Right, a bench.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:90%
The bench he was on.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have a couple
more images here that also are

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
from the Civil War,
which was very similar,

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
right down to a
cannon, one of them

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:90%
that he had drawn of a cannon.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Now here we're seeing a
field, very primitive hospital

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:90%
here, during the Civil War.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, an historian
sent those images to me

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:90%
after he heard Chase's story.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:10%
And what Chase
described as these poles

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.000 align:middle line:10%
with some material covering
them was fairly accurate.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.399 align:middle line:10%
OK.
And here we go.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:10%
Here's a drawing of his where
you have a horse drawing

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:10%
a cart with a cannon on it.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:10%
That's what he described
when he was seven.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:10%
And what was interesting,
too, is the images

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:10%
were consistent over two years,
and the core of the story

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:10%
remained the same.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:10%
And I love the last photo of
the black Civil War soldier

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:10%
standing next to his cannon.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:10%
And I think, wouldn't it
be interesting if that

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.561 align:middle line:10%
were Chase in his past life?
-Exactly.

00:11:29.561 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-That would be very weird.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:90%
That would be very interested.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
But so that experience really
led me into my research,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:84%
because I thought it
was the most fascinating

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:90%
thing I had ever witnessed.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, and if you were going
into that area of research,

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
there was really almost
nowhere else for you

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to go but to end up in the lap
of Ian Stevenson's work, right?

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.621 align:middle line:84%
Famous, famous past
life researcher.

00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a
little while to find

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%
his work because it was
published by the University

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Press of Virginia.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't find
it in a bookstore,

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.150 align:middle line:84%
so I had to do a little
digging and delving.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But when I found his
work I was so ecstatic,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
because nobody had been talking
about this in any of the books

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.330 align:middle line:90%
I had read.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
So I found that Ian Stevenson
was a professor of psychiatry

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:90%
at UVA Medical School.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And since the
early 1960s, he had

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
been investigating cases
of children who had

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous past life recall.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, young children,
usually up to about the age

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
of seven, would
spontaneously talk

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
about when I was big
before, my other family,

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.700 align:middle line:90%
when I died before.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I had
hit a vein of gold.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was a treasure.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So what I learned from Dr.
Stevenson, from his many books,

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
which are pretty academic-- he
has many, many case studies--

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:84%
during the course of his career
he documented about 2,700

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:90%
of these cases, mostly in Asia.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Because they're more open
to the notion of past lives

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't necessarily, on
a moral or religious level,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:90%
squeeze out that potential.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, what I found
through my own research later

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:84%
was that because of the
permissive environment,

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
where people acknowledge this,
the memories are more detailed.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So the children were
more forthcoming.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So now when you were doing
this research with him,

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
there was a time at which
you continued your research

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:84%
into an area that had more
to do with the healing

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.001 align:middle line:84%
aspect of this rather than
just the documentation.

00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
But what I learned from Dr.
Stevenson-- which helped

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
me make that shift into
healing and a healing model

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
for children-- he saw the
patterns, the very young age

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:90%
at which children remembered.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:84%
He saw that children, when
he could verify the cases,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the children
gave enough specific

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:84%
information that they could
trace their former identities,

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
he was able to
establish correlation

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
between the present child
and the past life personality

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
through similar
behaviors, preferences.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting, because
in some of the cases that he

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
investigated, the present
child who was maybe two, three,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:84%
or four years old, when taken
to this other community,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
for example, that they
remembered living before,

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
where they lived before, the
child would lead Dr. Stevenson

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and his colleagues to a house.
-OK.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.867 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about the
little boy in Thailand.

00:14:38.867 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is a good example.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I think I know what
you're leading up to.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
When I read your book
a couple of years ago,

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
this was one of my
favorite stories.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I've told it to so many people,
partially because I just

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
found it so amusing,
trying to imagine

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:90%
the family in that situation.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:90%
So please do tell.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about him.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:90%
It is very amazing.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a
typical Stevenson case.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:84%
This little boy in
Thailand would always

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:90%
pretend to be a schoolteacher.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So around age two, he started
saying he was a teacher.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And he also said that he had
a wife, and named the wife,

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and he said he had twins,
and named the twins.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said he came
from this other village,

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:90%
and named the village.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was just enough
distance away in rural Thailand

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that the grandmother who raised
him didn't want to venture

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
out and approach another family
because she was afraid, even

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:84%
in Thailand, that they
would think she was crazy

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:90%
or concocting a story.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But this child insisted that
he was the schoolteacher,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and he said, and I
was shot and I died.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.990 align:middle line:84%
They shot me in
the head when I was

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:90%
riding to school on my bicycle.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So by the age of three,
this little boy--

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:84%
his name is Chennai,
I think that's how

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
you pronounce it--
begged his grandmother

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:90%
to go to this other town.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And they took a bus.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Once they landed in the town,
he led them to this house.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:90%
The door opened.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
There was an elderly
couple there.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And he greeted them by name.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And he told-- these
people would have been

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:90%
the schoolteacher's parents.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were so enthralled
with his story and his knowledge

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of the man who-- their
son, who had died,

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:84%
who was a schoolteacher,
who was shot riding

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:84%
a bicycle on his way
to school-- that they

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do a little test.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So they invited the
grandmother and Chennai back,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, sometime
later, within a few weeks.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And they sampled a lot of
people in the room as a test.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:84%
This sounds familiar,
because this

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%
is how they choose the
new Dalai Lama each time,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:90%
through these series of tests.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So Chennai pointed to his
wife and said, that's my wife.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And these two grown
girls, these are my girls.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and where
are my blue jeans?

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.831 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Where's my stuff?

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you think you
go to the afterlife

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, you get all
cosmic and enlightened.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe in that
realm, but he's back.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
He's back, and he
wants his jeans.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And right before this
schoolteacher had died,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:84%
he had purchased a
new pair of jeans,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
which I guess was a major
purchase in Thailand,

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:90%
in rural Thailand.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And what was most
amazing was-- to me,

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and this is really important
about Dr. Stevenson's work,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
too-- is that he
passed test after test.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
He remembered details of
the schoolteacher's life.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And when they examined
him, his head,

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
they found there
were two birthmarks

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:84%
where the schoolteacher
had been shot.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And the two birthmarks were
these round pigmentations

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that corresponded
exactly to the entry

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.061 align:middle line:84%
and exit wounds of the bullet
that killed the schoolteacher.

00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:84%
-Amazing.
-So that was the final test.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.999 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the
evidence was there.

00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And the part that I found
amusing about that story

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:84%
is that he was bossing
everyone around.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:84%
He was telling his kids
what to do, his wife.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.494 align:middle line:84%
He's probably, what, about
two feet tall or something.

00:18:17.494 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:90%
He's a three-year-old.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:90%
He's a three-year-old.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But he was taking command
of his family again.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So what Dr. Stevenson found
through these cases, I mean,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:84%
some of them are
hysterical, too,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.140 align:middle line:90%
because they're so bizarre.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Even in cultures where they
believe in reincarnation,

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:84%
some people are reluctant
to share these stories

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:84%
with other people, fear
that maybe another family

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.790 align:middle line:90%
will take their child away.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, they have a
lot of fear about it.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, how did that
family respond to him?

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I think they maintained
a relationship

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.820 align:middle line:90%
throughout his life.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:90%
That was what I understood.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But I've read so many
cases, I could be wrong.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But in case there was
an ongoing relationship,

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of adopted
him into the family.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Because he was being raised
by his grandmother, you said.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So he probably needed
a little more support.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:90%
He missed his family.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:90%
He missed his family.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's common.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So that story points out
a lot of the patterns

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Stevenson
recognized in the cases.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The young age,
recognition of people

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:90%
and places from the past.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:90%
He had similar behaviors.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
He took on the role of the
father again with the family.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And most significantly,
the physical correspondence

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
with the birthmarks, which
related to fatal wound

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
or injury in the
past life, which

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:84%
is another hallmark
of these cases.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And one pattern that Dr.
Stevenson saw that really led

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.220 align:middle line:84%
me on my path was that he
found that in 2,700 cases,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:84%
approximately 75% of
the kids remembered

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:90%
dying in a previous life.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
50% or so remembered
dying traumatically.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So what does that mean in
terms of turnaround times?

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Just a quick interjection.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.400 align:middle line:84%
What was the space time
wise, the length of time

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
between the time he was
shot-- the little Thai

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
boy-- between the time he was
shot and then reincarnated?

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it was probably
about three years.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
That was the average
Dr. Stevenson had found,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:90%
but it varies widely.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
This is one thing
that I have heard,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
reading about this subject,
is that when a person dies

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of trauma quickly,
unexpectedly, they

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:90%
often come back rather quickly.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.720 align:middle line:90%
I think that's generally true.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:90%
But generally.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
But also he found that a lot of
children, of those children who

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:84%
remembered dying
traumatically, about 35%

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.831 align:middle line:84%
had phobias relating
to the way they died.

00:20:51.831 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:90%
It make sense.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like Chase
had a phobia of loud

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
booming sounds, which
reminded him of his death

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:90%
behind the cannon.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
It was probably the
last sound he heard.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, and when we
speak about it this way,

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:90%
we can look to all of our lives.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Any phobia we have, if we care
to go that way, f can probably

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
open ourselves up to
the notion that we have

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:84%
met our end in this
way, or at least been

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:84%
seriously traumatized in this
thing we're phobic of now

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
in another time.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
healing aspect of it,

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:84%
because that's where you
really took off in your work.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The information,
the corroboration,

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.435 align:middle line:90%
OK, we have all the evidence.

00:21:30.435 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of cases.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of cases.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So then what?
-OK.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was amazed
that in all of the case

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
studies that I read
by Dr. Stevenson,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:90%
he never mentioned healing.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I had a chance
to meet him years later,

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that was the first
question I asked.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.185 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
you can't prove it.

00:21:47.185 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, actually, I
have a lot of cases with very

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
strong evidence that once a
child can express a past life

00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:84%
memory and process a traumatic
death, talk them through it,

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:84%
assure them they're now
in another lifetime,

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
in another body,
phobias go away.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:84%
They're much more grounded
in this present reality.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It has a healing effect on
them, and physically too, as

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:90%
in Chase's case with his wrist.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So I had been learning past
life therapy with adults.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I had started learning
before Chase had his memory.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But I never put it
together that children

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.590 align:middle line:84%
could have memories, especially
spontaneous memories.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from past
life therapy with adults

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is that we carry experiences
with us from previous lives.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:84%
We're all souls who have
had prior experiences.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
We carry talents, abilities,
attributes, wisdom.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But some traumatic deaths
leave a great imprint

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:90%
on the reincarnating soul.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:84%
It's almost the same
as trauma in this life.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:84%
When we have trauma
in this life,

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.700 align:middle line:84%
the energy gets
frozen in that trauma.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And with that
energy are thoughts,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:90%
feelings, physical sensations.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with
past life trauma.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So when these very young
children are coming in,

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
they're still on this continuum
of consciousness from past life

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
into present
through the rebirth.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.230 align:middle line:84%
They still have this
patterning, as you

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:90%
talked about in the intro.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:90%
The patterns are there.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So if they have an
unprocessed traumatic death,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, like drowning, they
might come in phobic of water.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
They might have memories where
they remember-- they might

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.670 align:middle line:84%
express to their parents,
when I was big before I

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:90%
died when I fell off the boat.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And in this culture, we don't
really put that together.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
We dismiss it as
fantasy, and we scratch

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
our heads over the phobia,
but nothing is resolved.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So from my knowledge of past
life therapy with adults,

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and from Stevenson's work saying
this is a natural phenomenon

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:84%
in young children up until
about the age of seven,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I realized, well,
maybe these are healing

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:90%
opportunities for the soul.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
It was so easy for Chase
to let go of his phobia.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:90%
It was so close to the surface.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:84%
It just required someone
to ask him about it.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Whereas oftentimes
if you're dealing

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
with an adult with
past life regression,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
the adult has so much built up
around it, defense mechanisms

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
to learn to have
dealt with the phobia,

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
or to try to explain it away,
or relegate it to someplace it

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be, that
you have to break

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
through layer after layer,
I would assume, right?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Which requires meditation,
hypnosis, different methods

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.550 align:middle line:84%
to get to the memory, whereas
with children it's right there.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.660 align:middle line:90%
They want to heal.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:84%
The soul wants to
heal to an early age.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we can recognize it
for what it is at the time,

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and allow the child to
express it, it can heal them

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have to carry
the pattern into adulthood.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible
that as adults,

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:84%
because we build up--I mean,
these phobias become stronger,

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.310 align:middle line:84%
usually, within the lifetime--
that a little child-- I mean,

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:84%
granted, they're
not comfortable--

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Chase didn't like the loud
sounds and all of that--

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
but that the little
child can handle

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.080 align:middle line:84%
kind of a revisitation
maybe a little

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.100 align:middle line:90%
easier than an adult can?

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're doing it
naturally through the phobia.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.585 align:middle line:84%
They're having an emotional
catharsis of some kind.

00:25:30.585 --> 00:25:32.666 align:middle line:84%
Whereas adults are really
trying to avoid the pain.

00:25:32.666 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Right.
And it's right there.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.141 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's always blocked.

00:25:35.141 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
It's right there.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:90%
So we're not doing anything.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
We're just recognizing
what's happening in the child

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and helping them
work through it.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, this subject
is near and dear to me

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
because I had the
opportunity about 20,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago to work
with a really good

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:90%
regressionist just for kicks.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It was a meditation
group, and I happened

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
to be fairly easy to guide, or
to float freely, shall we say,

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:90%
once I was in a relaxed state.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I was taken into many,
many different experiences, all

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:90%
throughout periods of history.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And then my son, when
he was three years old,

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:84%
during this period of time,
surprised me by one day

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:90%
telling me of his own past life.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was something
out of the mouths

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.710 align:middle line:84%
of babes, very similar to
what you had experienced.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- I was feeling
regretful about something,

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and about a time we'd had
together in the past where

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:90%
I was not a very fit mother.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.240 align:middle line:90%
I was overwhelmed.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Had way too many kids.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Didn't care anymore.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I was exhausted.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Didn't give him any TLC.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Every mother can
relate to that.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I didn't give
him anything of myself.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have
anything left to give.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.010 align:middle line:84%
His siblings raised him,
and I gave him nothing.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And one night I was feeling
like, just kind of regretful.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
honey, I love you dearly.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
time I didn't treat

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:90%
you as well as I should have.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And I don't ever want you
to go through that again,

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:90%
or think that I don't love you.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's building a little
pillow fort, you know,

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:90%
and he said, oh, it's OK, mom.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:90%
We all do it sometimes.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:90%
I did it to you, too.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
where you just stop.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
When a young child at that age
says something so profound,

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:90%
it's a good thing to listen.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, and because I knew
about the process of it,

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, would you please tell
me more about what happened?

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you know this?

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the best
thing you can say.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out in his case,
he was at his nursery school.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I
was at Busy Bee,

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was supposed
to be taking a nap.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And I just saw this.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And so he told me details of
where he was which matched--

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:90%
and he didn't know anything.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:84%
He was very protected,
also, like your son.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Waldorf education,
very little TV.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:84%
He didn't understand about
other parts of the world,

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and he explained what they
looked like, his clothing,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.330 align:middle line:84%
everything that was going
on, and told me the situation

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:84%
between us, that it occurred
where he wasn't-- he said,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
the mom had died
and you were my kid.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I used to beat
you up because I

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.790 align:middle line:90%
missed her and I was sad.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.189 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:28:13.189 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we had each had a
situation where we had been--

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:84%
we hadn't treated each
other well in the past

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and agreed to come back in this
incarnation to give us, each

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:84%
other, the best of everything,
which we have managed to do.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't an
uncommon story.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure some of
you watching this

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.680 align:middle line:84%
have probably had very similar
feelings, or even at least

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:84%
questions about your
own relationship

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:84%
of this nature with some of your
kids and some of your feelings.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
this more when we come right

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:90%
back after a little break.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.240 align:middle line:84%
We are back, and we're going
to pick up that conversation.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to--
the little epilogue

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
was that once, I
think, both of us

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:84%
realized-- I didn't find out for
years later, until many years

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.620 align:middle line:84%
later, just a few years
ago, I was his daughter

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and I looked like his wife.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:90%
That's why he was so frustrated.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:90%
He was violent with me.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And I had to help
raise the other kids,

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
he was so angry and
lonely at that loss.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And what it did
was, I had always

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.430 align:middle line:84%
wondered, why would
I have not treated

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:90%
him well in that lifetime?

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I know I was tired.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:90%
And why did these things happen?

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And what happened between us is
that just, hey, things happen.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.490 align:middle line:84%
We're here to balance it.
-Absolutely.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.640 align:middle line:84%
This is just a
time of balancing.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of the journey
that you're speaking of.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And is this an appropriate
time to go into,

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:90%
his name is Blake Hawken?

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
The Blake Hawken case.
-Yeah.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I was
developing these theories.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I was developing these
models for helping children,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.630 align:middle line:90%
but I had to test it out.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:90%
So I got a phone call.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:10%
This is pre-internet days.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:10%
I had put an ad in "Mothering"
magazine asking for parents

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.340 align:middle line:10%
to give me cases if
their children had

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:10%
ever said anything that
resembled a past life memory.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.780 align:middle line:10%
So Colleen Hawken
called me on the phone

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.500 align:middle line:10%
and told me her story
about her son Blake.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Right after Blake
turned three, he

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.950 align:middle line:84%
was watching his older brother
getting on the school bus.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:84%
He started yelling to his
brother, get out of the street.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And his mother came running,
Colleen, and she said,

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:34.240 align:middle line:90%
is everything all right?

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:10%
And he put his hand on
his ear, and he said,

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.810 align:middle line:10%
man hit me with truck.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:10%
This is three-year-old language.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.741 align:middle line:10%
And she said, you
mean in preschool?

00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:10%
A toy truck?
He said no, a big truck.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:10%
And it just so happened that
Colleen had seen Brian Weiss

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:10%
on "Oprah" the day before.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:57.700 align:middle line:10%
And he made one remark saying
that sometimes children

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:10%
have past life memories.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:10%
So Colleen was primed and ready.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.570 align:middle line:10%
And she listened to Blake.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:10%
She said, you mean someone
hit you with a toy truck?

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:90%
He said no, a big truck.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:90%
And she said, what happened?

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I
went under the wheels,

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I could look
up and see the wheels.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
where was your mommy?

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said she had gone
bye bye at the store.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
what happened?

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I died.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.110 align:middle line:90%
And Colleen was duly shocked.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't know
what to do with that.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe a
couple weeks later,

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.780 align:middle line:90%
another big truck went by.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And again Blake brought
up the story of the truck

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.420 align:middle line:84%
hitting him and going
under the wheels.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And again Colleen filed it away.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So she didn't think about it
because she had an older child

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and a younger child, so
three kids under five,

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.130 align:middle line:90%
I think, at the time.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.930 align:middle line:84%
But she noticed that Blake
was getting depressed.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:84%
He had been a very happy child,
and he started withdrawing.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And he started complaining
about aches and pains

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:90%
on the left side of his body.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So she took him to a doctor,
and there was nothing

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.040 align:middle line:90%
physiologically wrong with him.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And she thought, well,
Blake is the middle child.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.310 align:middle line:90%
He's just neglected.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:26.510 align:middle line:84%
It's all my fault. We mothers
take it all on, right?

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And she was concerned,
and she would

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.680 align:middle line:84%
try to massage the
left side of his body

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:84%
where he said he had
the aches and pains.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And he would say to her,
I hate you and I love you.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And she was thinking, this
kid might need therapy.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And she was very
busy with her life.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And they went to London to
visit her husband's relatives.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And they were at a
busy intersection,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.810 align:middle line:90%
and Blake was in a stroller.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden he
jumped out of the stroller

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.230 align:middle line:84%
into the path of
an oncoming truck.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the truck
driver, the lorry driver,

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.580 align:middle line:84%
slammed on his brakes, and
Blake's father pulled him

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:90%
up by the scruff of his neck.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
truck driver yelled

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.630 align:middle line:90%
at Colleen and her husband.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment, Colleen
made the connection,

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
could this have anything
to do with what Blake told

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.160 align:middle line:90%
me about being hit by a truck?

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And if so, does that mean he's
destined to repeat something?

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.350 align:middle line:90%
So she was extremely upset.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And she called me after
they got back from London.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:84%
She had found my ad in
"Mothering" magazine.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was listening to her, and
I was explaining that sometimes

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.370 align:middle line:84%
children carry these
memories with them,

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and there is a repetition
that goes along with this.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they act out
something from the past.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was listening
to her, thinking,

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.820 align:middle line:84%
she can't take him
to a therapist.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.070 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to do?

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Right, drug him?

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I was kind of
winging it and flying

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.850 align:middle line:84%
by the seat of my
pants, because I

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.150 align:middle line:84%
had started developing
these models,

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:84%
but I hadn't really
tested it out.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her, look,
he needs to know that what

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:90%
he experienced was real.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.449 align:middle line:84%
You have to join
him in his reality.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So wait until a time
when he's relaxed,

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:90%
like right before bedtime.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Give him a little massage,
and say that you know that he

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:90%
was hit by a truck before.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.219 align:middle line:84%
And tell him that it
was a different mommy,

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:31.139 align:middle line:90%
a different life.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:90%
He's now in a new life.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Because as strange as it
sounds, with children that age,

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.080 align:middle line:84%
they can't differentiate between
past life and present reality.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.520 align:middle line:90%
It's all a blur.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.150 align:middle line:84%
A past life, to
them, is something

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.239 align:middle line:84%
that could have happened
last week, especially when

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:48.830 align:middle line:84%
it gets triggered,
like the sight

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:51.350 align:middle line:90%
of that truck triggered Blake.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So I was telling her, just
reassure him he's now safe.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.850 align:middle line:90%
You're another mommy.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Because she had said that
his mother had gone bye

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.680 align:middle line:84%
bye at the store, so maybe
he felt angry with her,

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.500 align:middle line:90%
or abandoned.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So a week later, I got
a call from Colleen,

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.870 align:middle line:90%
and she was very excited.

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.240 align:middle line:90%
She said, I did what you said.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I waited until bedtime.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.700 align:middle line:90%
I gave him a little massage.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, Blake, what
happened to you

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.610 align:middle line:84%
when you were hit by the
truck was in another life.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said, for the first
time in months, his eyes lit up,

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:90%
and he said, another life?

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, and
that was a different mommy.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:34.680 align:middle line:90%
He said, a different mommy?

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.550 align:middle line:84%
It was like she could feel
this energy in the room change.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:84%
She said yeah, and she named all
the people in his present life.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'll always
protect you, and we love you.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And she said it was like that.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:90%
He changed so quick.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:84%
He just completely
changed the energy.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.851 align:middle line:84%
They're so open.
Yeah.

00:35:49.851 --> 00:35:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said that the next day
he was back to his happy self.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.200 align:middle line:84%
The depression had
completely vanished.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And the aches and pains
that he had complained

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.720 align:middle line:90%
about for months vanished.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.970 align:middle line:84%
He just needed to
know that it was over.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:90%
He let go.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:middle line:90%
He let go, and she helped him.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful story.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It was magical.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So that gave me a lot of
fuel to continue and--

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, to create your
protocols to keep working.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:84%
You've dealt with so many people
in the interim, which of course

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.020 align:middle line:84%
you've chronicled in these
two books, "Children's

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Past Lives" and
"Return from Heaven,"

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.180 align:middle line:90%
which are just wonderful books.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't
want to put them down,

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:34.260 align:middle line:84%
because we can't get
enough of these stories.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.800 align:middle line:84%
They're the stuff
movies are made of.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, I
really like talking

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:45.470 align:middle line:84%
about these case scenarios
because we can relate to them.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not just theoretical.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:90%
We can picture them.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to talk about
the really famous one now,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.011 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, a motion picture
is being made, I understand,

00:36:55.011 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:84%
possibly?
-As far as I know, yes.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.960 align:middle line:90%
They're working on the script.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:90%
James Leininger.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And some people, if you've
been into this subject,

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:90%
are curious about.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard
something about it

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.500 align:middle line:84%
in little news
clips of the past.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Is this the one?

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and actually he's been
on some major TV shows, too.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he has.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.860 align:middle line:90%
We did an "ABC Primetime."

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about him
and what happened.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have some more
great visuals on this one.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a
prelude to this story,

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.400 align:middle line:84%
too, because I went on
a field investigation

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:28.060 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Stevenson in Chicago,
investigating one of my cases.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the basis
for the second book

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.890 align:middle line:90%
on same family reincarnation.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And we were saying, why aren't
there great American cases

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:90%
that can be verified?

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And this was just, like,
it was the year 2000.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, just
wait, because the internet,

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I bet we're going to
find some great cases,

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.490 align:middle line:84%
because people had no way
of contacting Dr. Stevenson

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:90%
or me except through letters.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So I got an email
from this mother

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.380 align:middle line:90%
in Louisiana, Andrea Leininger.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.870 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in 2001, 2002.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said that her son
had just turned two, James.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And he was having nightmares,
severe nightmares,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.650 align:middle line:90%
five times a week.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.040 align:middle line:90%
He would wake up screaming.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.930 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't calm him down.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he would talk about, I
can't get out, I can't get out,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and he would thrash and kick.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was driving
them crazy because they

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:90%
weren't getting any sleep.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Andrea's mother found
my book and said,

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.600 align:middle line:84%
did you ever consider
the possibility

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.710 align:middle line:90%
that this could be a past life?

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So she started talking
to him, acknowledging it.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.960 align:middle line:90%
You know, what happened?

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm in plane.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Plane's on fire.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Little man can't get out.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was really interesting,
because he was also obsessed

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:84%
with anything that had
to do with airplanes,

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.540 align:middle line:84%
especially World
War II airplanes.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.050 align:middle line:90%
He knew everything about them.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.720 align:middle line:84%
-And he was still, what, three?
-Two.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.741 align:middle line:84%
Two.
OK.

00:39:04.741 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:84%
All right.
-Two, two and 1/2.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:90%
This went on for months.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So probably about
the age of three,

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.770 align:middle line:84%
she started asking
the questions.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.510 align:middle line:84%
She felt comfortable
doing it knowing that this

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.270 align:middle line:90%
is not anything that unusual.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And she would ask
him questions like,

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:84%
do you remember, you're
flying your plane?

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
He would always say,
I flew a Corsair.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what a Corsair was.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And part of this drama was
that her husband Bruce was kind

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.810 align:middle line:84%
of very Christian, didn't
believe in reincarnation,

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to believe
in reincarnation.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And any time James
would say anything,

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.160 align:middle line:84%
he would go to the internet
to try to disprove it.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So they found out
the Corsair was

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.580 align:middle line:84%
the type of airplane that was
flown off of aircraft carriers.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So Andrea would
say, well, do you

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:90%
remember anything about that?

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:90%
And he would say, yeah.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.150 align:middle line:84%
He said we took off a
ship, a boat, a big boat.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.370 align:middle line:84%
She said, do you
remember the name?

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said Natoma.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And he would always draw,
in his child drawings,

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:09.790 align:middle line:84%
he would always draw pictures
of planes being shot down.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.720 align:middle line:84%
He was obsessed with that, too.
-Here's one here.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:90%
We see that it's going down.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.340 align:middle line:84%
It's in bright red, and he
writes, "To Dad from James."

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So this went on for
a few years, too.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And Andrea would say,
well, what was your name?

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:26.760 align:middle line:90%
And he would say James.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it was
one point for Bruce.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, he must
be making this up.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.790 align:middle line:84%
But then he would say
things out of the blue.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
They would be driving
in the car and he'd say,

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:84%
you know, my plane would
always get flat tires

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.550 align:middle line:90%
when it landed on the boat.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And he knew all kinds of
terminology about airplanes.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.730 align:middle line:84%
He knew everything
about airplanes.

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And any normal parent would
suspect something here.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.235 align:middle line:84%
But Bruce was adamant that
reincarnation doesn't exist.

00:40:56.235 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.990 align:middle line:84%
He had the obsession
with airplanes.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.490 align:middle line:90%
He knew the terminology.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:90%
He knew everything.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And finally they asked
him, what was your name?

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:09.770 align:middle line:90%
He said James.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.710 align:middle line:90%
I said that, he dismissed that.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But then Andrea said, do you
remember any of your friends?

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.480 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Jack Larson.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So Bruce started doing this very
deep research on the internet

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and found out there was an
aircraft carrier in World War

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.180 align:middle line:90%
II, the Natoma Bay.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And he actually was able to
access the logs to that ship

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and found out there
was a Jack Larson.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But that didn't even tip
him into belief until--

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:38.610 align:middle line:90%
He was a hard nut.

00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:40.600 align:middle line:90%
He was hard core.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.430 align:middle line:90%
He was really hard core.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:84%
One day Bruce, the father,
ordered a book on World War II,

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:90%
and he was thumbing through it.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And little James was
standing next to him.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was an aerial
view of Iwo Jima.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And little James looked
at the photo and he said,

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:01.080 align:middle line:90%
that's where my plane went down.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's the goose
bumps moment for Bruce,

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.940 align:middle line:84%
where he goes-- he said his
skepticism just melted away.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So they were actually
able to trace

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.545 align:middle line:84%
who he was through the Survivors
of the Natoma Bay Association.

00:42:16.545 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And we have a couple pictures
of him as-- who he was was?

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.290 align:middle line:10%
His name in his former
life was James Houston

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:10%
Jr., which would explain--
he always signed his drawings

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:10%
James III.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:36.640 align:middle line:10%
So he was the third James,
but a different last name.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.440 align:middle line:84%
There he is in his-- I
don't know if it's a Corsair,

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:90%
but the cockpit of his plane.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.620 align:middle line:90%
It is a Corsair.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a Corsair he's in.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened was
they found out who he was.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.770 align:middle line:84%
They found out he had
a surviving sister

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.530 align:middle line:90%
in California who was elderly.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And they had to prepare
her, because they were going

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:90%
national on TV with the story.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So they tracked her
down, told her the story.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately she was
receptive and sent them

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:84%
photographs of her
brother, the picture of him

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:90%
in front of his Corsair.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.860 align:middle line:84%
He was very proud of
that, because that

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:90%
was an elite squad.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And she sent photos of
him when he was young.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.020 align:middle line:90%
These photos are great.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:90%
We have them, the side by sides.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.120 align:middle line:90%
It's very amazing.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.120 align:middle line:10%
Talk about this whole notion
of facial architecture,

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:10%
of people-- you can see here.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:10%
We have a few photos.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.300 align:middle line:10%
Here's one where you
can see the structure

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:34.780 align:middle line:10%
of their face, their expression,
the two Jameses' smiles, even.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.500 align:middle line:90%
The chin.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the chin.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is not always
the case, but in some cases

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.230 align:middle line:84%
even the facial
architecture carries over.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.830 align:middle line:84%
This is really interesting,
because this little boy

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:84%
somehow not only--
look at this one here.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:55.510 align:middle line:84%
They just-- you can see the very
strong similarities in the two.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of spirit
that comes through them

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.810 align:middle line:90%
that's very similar as well.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So they have kind of
a similar facial form.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:84%
They also have in this
one-- here we go again.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And they also
brought through-- he

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.260 align:middle line:84%
brought through the same name.
-He did.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Which is really interesting.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.290 align:middle line:90%
That is interesting.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.911 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of-- well, there
are many beautiful aspects

00:44:15.911 --> 00:44:16.610 align:middle line:90%
of this case.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:20.420 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that the sister
of James Houston, Ann Baron,

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.390 align:middle line:84%
could corroborate all the things
that little James remembered

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:24.950 align:middle line:90%
about the family life.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and in fact he ended
up meeting his sister,

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:90%
who was elderly now.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:10%
And he was still quite small.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.660 align:middle line:10%
Look at them.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.659 align:middle line:10%
Look at the look on his face.

00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:35.990 align:middle line:10%
That is the sweetest picture.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.870 align:middle line:10%
That is-- and look at her.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, can you imagine?

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.270 align:middle line:10%
It gives you chills, to
think that her brother,

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:46.080 align:middle line:10%
who she probably missed from all
those years before, was back.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.340 align:middle line:10%
She could feel his spirit.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.480 align:middle line:10%
She could see his eyes.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.450 align:middle line:10%
And you can see how
happy the two of them

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:51.380 align:middle line:10%
are to be together there.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.640 align:middle line:10%
It's just an amazing photograph.
-It is.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.690 align:middle line:10%
And what's amazing
about this story,

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:00.200 align:middle line:10%
too, is that we did this
wonderful piece on "ABC Prime

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:10%
Time," and a Japanese
film crew saw the story,

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:11.330 align:middle line:10%
and flew the Leininger family
to Japan to the site where James

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:13.510 align:middle line:10%
Houston's plane went down.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.420 align:middle line:90%
And they did a memorial service.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And Andrea told me about it.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.840 align:middle line:84%
She said everyone was
in tears on the boat.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.930 align:middle line:90%
They were out in a boat.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And she said her son threw
a bouquet into the water,

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and he saluted, and
he said-- chokes

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:33.670 align:middle line:90%
me up-- I'll never forget you.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was really interesting.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:39.700 align:middle line:84%
It was like closure for
him, because afterwards,

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.930 align:middle line:84%
he started drawing
these very happy

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.170 align:middle line:90%
scenes of water and boats.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.681 align:middle line:84%
And you have those
drawings, too.

00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.851 align:middle line:10%
But also, he saw his
friend Jack, right?

00:45:52.851 --> 00:45:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.620 align:middle line:10%
He went to a reunion
where he met his sister,

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.450 align:middle line:10%
and he actually met Jack Larson.

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:03.220 align:middle line:10%
And they were like old buddies.

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.320 align:middle line:10%
There they are.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.350 align:middle line:10%
He and his old military buddy,
his old Air Force buddy Jack,

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:09.770 align:middle line:10%
back together again.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:10%
This is an extraordinary
story on so many levels,

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.930 align:middle line:10%
about the desire of
this soul to come

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:10%
back and heal this situation
through this family, really.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And how all of this corroborated
for parents all over the world

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.530 align:middle line:84%
to be able to turn to and
point to as an example

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:32.020 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
situation, in case

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:84%
this is something
that they're curious

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.440 align:middle line:90%
about in their own lives.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just like
a classic, textbook,

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:38.850 align:middle line:84%
beautiful case example.
-Exactly.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But he did have closure, and you
can see it through his artwork.

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:43.060 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It's an intact plane flying
through a field of flowers.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.210 align:middle line:10%
So it's really lovely.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:53.210 align:middle line:10%
And what was especially
important about this case

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.460 align:middle line:10%
is a lot of the great
cases that Dr. Stevenson

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.070 align:middle line:10%
had were in Asian cultures.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So Americans or Westerners
could write off these cases,

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.010 align:middle line:84%
well, they believe
in that stuff,

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:06.490 align:middle line:84%
so of course they're
going to find the cases.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.631 align:middle line:84%
This is the one, the textbook
one you were looking for.

00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Where the father did not
want to believe in it,

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.960 align:middle line:84%
but the evidence was
completely overwhelming.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I hope they
do make the movie.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.991 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
process of doing it.

00:47:20.991 --> 00:47:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I want to be
there on opening night.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.540 align:middle line:84%
What about this
notion of carrying

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:29.730 align:middle line:84%
forward not just facial
characteristics and all,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.110 align:middle line:90%
but names?

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Is this something that is--

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it happens
sometimes, and it's-- I think,

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.370 align:middle line:84%
unconsciously, the parents are
triggered to give the name.

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:40.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's not--

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, the soul
could be prompting it

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.480 align:middle line:90%
from the other side.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, through dreams.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I had an
experience of exactly that,

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes it's easy
for me to tap into other things

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.800 align:middle line:84%
because I've been working
with myself in meditation

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.900 align:middle line:90%
and in these realms for awhile.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And when my sister's baby
was about to be born,

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:01.400 align:middle line:84%
the entity that was
going to be the baby

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.140 align:middle line:90%
came and told me her name.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, my sister had
said, we're just

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.780 align:middle line:90%
starting to think about names.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And I called her
the next morning

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and said, before
you choose, can I

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.320 align:middle line:84%
just share with you what I
happened to hear from, I think,

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.760 align:middle line:90%
your child?

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
well, we've already

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:84%
chosen a name,
Alexander or Alexandra,

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.650 align:middle line:84%
depending on if it's
a boy or a girl.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:23.480 align:middle line:84%
That's the exact name
that I was given.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:28.580 align:middle line:84%
In the same night that being
went to her parents and to me,

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and was very clear and strong
that was to be her name.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole chapter
on that very phenomenon

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.120 align:middle line:84%
in my second book,
"Return from Heaven."

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's important that
we're even open and intuitive

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.160 align:middle line:84%
in the naming process.
-Right.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Which also says that these
souls who are coming into us

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.510 align:middle line:90%
are aware of us.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Choice may not be
the correct word,

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:53.800 align:middle line:84%
or the best word to describe
it, but there's a draw,

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.730 align:middle line:84%
either through love,
through familiarity,

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:58.010 align:middle line:90%
through unfinished business--

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Through DNA.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Where they're coming, whatever.
Yes.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So they are trying to
communicate with us before they

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.240 align:middle line:84%
come in, and they are
definitely observing us,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.930 align:middle line:84%
because consciousness
doesn't die.

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these are souls.

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.650 align:middle line:90%
They're aware of who we are.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:13.730 align:middle line:84%
They are aware of the
plan for this life.

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So they're coming in,
and sometimes they

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:19.690 align:middle line:84%
do, through a dream,
let us know their names.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:22.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very important that I
think we remain alert to this,

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:26.330 align:middle line:84%
anyone who is expecting
a child or a grandchild,

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.590 align:middle line:84%
be alert to this whole period
of time that's happening

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.910 align:middle line:84%
before the birth, of
welcoming this being

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and being open and receptive
to any kinds of impulses

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:38.210 align:middle line:84%
or information they may want
to assist you in knowing

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:39.530 align:middle line:90%
prior to their birth.

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Right, because one of the
things that these memories

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.270 align:middle line:84%
teach us, or the expression
of these memories,

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.630 align:middle line:90%
is that we are souls.

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:49.800 align:middle line:84%
We come in with these
other experiences,

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and it really can
help us as parents

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.300 align:middle line:84%
to understand our children
on a deep, deep, deep level.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And our connections to
them, too, because usually,

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.540 align:middle line:84%
if you have a very strong bond
with someone in this life,

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:90%
it's not new.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to mention,
if we have enough time,

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that I did write a book
about reincarnation

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.830 align:middle line:84%
in the same family because
it's such a common phenomenon,

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that someone in the
family can die--

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:84%
say your grandmother
dies, and you're

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.560 align:middle line:84%
very attached to her-- she can
come back as your own child.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And it can happen in
less than nine months.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And what prompted
me to write the book

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.810 align:middle line:84%
was the story of
another Chicago mother.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going on in Chicago

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.660 align:middle line:90%
with these past life memories.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.360 align:middle line:90%
But they're all over the place.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.591 align:middle line:84%
Please share this, because
this is a very important topic,

00:50:39.591 --> 00:50:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I feel.
-It is.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And people need to
know it can happen,

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.210 align:middle line:90%
because I think it's so common.

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:49.620 align:middle line:84%
This mother, Kathy Luke,
she was a teenage mother.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Her two-year-old developed
neuroblastoma and had tumors

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.310 align:middle line:84%
all over his body,
but most prominently,

00:50:56.310 --> 00:51:00.060 align:middle line:84%
one behind his left eye
which caused blindness

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.080 align:middle line:90%
at the end of his life.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.430 align:middle line:10%
He had an IV
inserted on his neck.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:05.710 align:middle line:10%
They were trying to sustain
him in the hospital,

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.490 align:middle line:10%
and he had a big tumor
behind his right ear

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.510 align:middle line:10%
that had been biopsied.

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.030 align:middle line:10%
And he ended up dying.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And Kathy was young.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:17.400 align:middle line:10%
She met a wonderful
man, married,

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.940 align:middle line:10%
had a son, a daughter,
and then a third child

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.150 align:middle line:10%
born by C-section.

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:28.980 align:middle line:10%
She named this new baby--
blanking on it-- Chad.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
born, the doctors

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:35.200 align:middle line:84%
came into the room-- he was
born by C-section-- and said,

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.110 align:middle line:90%
we have bad news.

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:39.240 align:middle line:84%
It looks like he's
blind in his left eye.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And she said, bring me
my baby, and they did.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing that she saw,

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.550 align:middle line:84%
it looked like he had
a scar on his neck

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.800 align:middle line:84%
where the IV had been on
her other child, James.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.530 align:middle line:90%
His name was James.

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like
he had a large tumor

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.480 align:middle line:90%
behind his right ear.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.125 align:middle line:84%
And she said rhetorically,
how can this be?

00:51:57.125 --> 00:51:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said,
it's just a birthmark

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.820 align:middle line:90%
and a functional cyst.

00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.420 align:middle line:90%
It will go away.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But she held this baby
for the first time

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and she said, she had had two
other children after James,

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and none of them
had felt like this.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And she knew it
was the same soul.

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So as time went on,
she kept it to herself

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:22.190 align:middle line:84%
because she came from a very
strict religious background.

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And by the age of three or four,
Chad was saying specific things

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:31.550 align:middle line:84%
about James's life, asking
for toys that James had had,

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:33.190 align:middle line:84%
which they didn't
have, and talking

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:35.780 align:middle line:84%
about the apartment
they had lived in,

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.780 align:middle line:90%
which he had never seen.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.620 align:middle line:90%
So these stories are real.

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It ended up healing Kathy from
the most traumatic wound we

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:46.844 align:middle line:90%
can experience, losing a child.

00:52:46.844 --> 00:52:48.510 align:middle line:84%
What happened with the
little boy and his health,

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:49.570 align:middle line:90%
his physical health?

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Did he obviously continue
growing and lives to this day?

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:54.280 align:middle line:90%
He was fine?

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.220 align:middle line:90%
I check in occasionally.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.370 align:middle line:84%
That was a long time ago, so
he's practically-- I guess he's

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:03.130 align:middle line:90%
about in his late teens now.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:04.549 align:middle line:84%
Oh, good.
OK.

00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:06.090 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful happy ending.

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:07.710 align:middle line:90%
His eye never fully recovered.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:08.430 align:middle line:90%
It was a carry-over.

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:15.350 align:middle line:84%
But that story prompted me
to write the second book,

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:17.494 align:middle line:90%
because to me that's a miracle.

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And the name of
that book, again, is?

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.790 align:middle line:90%
"Return from Heaven."

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:21.291 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's the "Return
from Heaven" book.

00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:23.980 align:middle line:84%
-The blue book.
-Right, the blue book.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.360 align:middle line:90%
These cases are common.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.700 align:middle line:84%
When I give lectures or
workshops, there are always

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.010 align:middle line:84%
people in the room
who go, oh my gosh,

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:32.530 align:middle line:84%
you know, I believe
that my daughter

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is my sister who died in a
car accident 20 years ago,

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.279 align:middle line:84%
or whatever.
Any permutation.

00:53:37.279 --> 00:53:38.550 align:middle line:90%
You hear this.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:39.970 align:middle line:84%
This is not uncommon.
-No.

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that is
most surprising to people

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.410 align:middle line:84%
is, somehow they
got in their minds

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:46.570 align:middle line:84%
that there is this
interval between lives

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.925 align:middle line:90%
that's 40 years or 100 years.

00:53:48.925 --> 00:53:50.950 align:middle line:90%
It can be less than nine months.

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It can be, because once the
beings, or the body, the fetus

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.130 align:middle line:84%
starts developing,
I mean, an agreement

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.770 align:middle line:84%
between the soul and
that particular body

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.620 align:middle line:90%
can be made at a later point.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not a
fully incarnate anyway.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.300 align:middle line:84%
There's always a part of
us in this other dimension.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So it can be just
literally months.

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.146 align:middle line:84%
And I've read some other--
-Days.

00:54:09.146 --> 00:54:10.020 align:middle line:90%
Days.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Hours.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.440 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I've read some
extraordinary stories

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:16.100 align:middle line:84%
of this kind in other
works as well as yours.

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But again, I mean, a lot
of this-- "Children's Past

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Lives" and "Return from Heaven."

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these stories
embedded in here

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.400 align:middle line:84%
are so confirming
and heartwarming.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And we only have a
few minutes left.

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to ask you,
if someone is thinking,

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.610 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, I've always
wondered about this trait

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:35.200 align:middle line:84%
in my child, grandchild, my
sister, my niece or nephew.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.480 align:middle line:84%
How do they get going
on this process?

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to catch them
when the children are young,

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.610 align:middle line:84%
while it's happening, while it's
spontaneous, because the window

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:46.360 align:middle line:90%
does close by the age of seven.

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So it requires
different techniques

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.470 align:middle line:84%
to get into that area
of the unconscious.

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But if a young child, a
two- or three-year-old,

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is talking about
it, pay attention.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Do what you did.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Ask open-ended questions.

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.020 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel
they're troubled,

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.660 align:middle line:84%
kind of talk them through
it and assure them they're

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.540 align:middle line:90%
now safe in a new body.

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But you have protocols
that you've developed now,

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:10.410 align:middle line:84%
like you talked about
with this one woman.

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Is that available in
your books or a website?

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:15.000 align:middle line:90%
In the book.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And I do have a forum,
reincarnationforum.com.

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have a team of
moderators who are

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:23.440 align:middle line:90%
fabulous, well-versed in this.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And people can post anonymously.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.580 align:middle line:84%
They post their stories,
they can get help.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And in extreme cases, if
they feel they need me,

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.100 align:middle line:84%
the moderators
alert me, and I'll

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.600 align:middle line:84%
communicate with the
parent to help the child.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Parents are in the best position
to help their own children,

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.100 align:middle line:84%
as the memories are
coming up spontaneously.

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's a fabulous case on
there, too, about 9/11 fireman.

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to say, we
only have about two minutes

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:47.269 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:55:47.269 --> 00:55:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Can you squash it
into two minutes?

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll try.

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Little boy in
California was born,

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 2003, 2004.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.690 align:middle line:84%
He declared he was a fireman,
obsessed with firefighting,

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:00.840 align:middle line:90%
knew all the terminology.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And he saw an image in
a "Curious George" book

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Twin Towers, and
he wanted to know why

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.440 align:middle line:90%
the bad guys knocked them down.

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was very upset
that he couldn't get

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.235 align:middle line:90%
the people out of the building.

00:56:10.235 --> 00:56:13.210 align:middle line:90%


00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And the mother got more
and more information.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.780 align:middle line:84%
She found out the number of
the firetruck, the number

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.780 align:middle line:90%
the firehouse from the child.

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.290 align:middle line:84%
She was able to
trace his identity.

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But she will not reveal
it because she doesn't

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:27.880 align:middle line:90%
know what to do with this.

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're going back and
forth as to whether she

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:32.020 align:middle line:90%
should approach the family.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.750 align:middle line:84%
She knows where they
are and who they are.

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So over time she'll work
her way through this.

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And the family will
work their way.

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand how
delicate that could be.

00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It's such a raw
loss at this point.

00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:45.190 align:middle line:90%
It's so recent.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
publicity around it.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:51.000 align:middle line:84%
So for parents listening
now that want to contact you,

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.750 align:middle line:84%
what's your website if they
want to check onto the forum?

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Carolbowman.com.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.130 align:middle line:90%
You can get to the forum.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to register,
but it's free.

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:00.270 align:middle line:90%
We just have to--

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Carolbowman.com.

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you have any
interest in this,

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.271 align:middle line:84%
and anything that's piquing
your own curiosity on it,

00:57:07.271 --> 00:57:09.600 align:middle line:84%

Bowman

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.960 align:middle line:90%
So I want to thank you so much.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a really good
message here, no matter what

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:16.600 align:middle line:84%
our beliefs in reincarnation,
that we should be listening

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.200 align:middle line:84%
much more closely to
our little children,

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.110 align:middle line:84%
because they may be telling us
a story about what they're here

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to do, what they're
here to learn,

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.650 align:middle line:84%
or even what they're
here to heal.

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, if you enjoyed
this conversation,

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.880 align:middle line:84%
you might also want to take
a look at my conversation

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.780 align:middle line:84%
with Paul Von Ward
here on Gaiam TV.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:57:36.640 --> 00:58:01.200 align:middle line:90%
