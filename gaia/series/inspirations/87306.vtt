00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.233 align:middle line:84%
And we are broadcasting
from the Sounds True

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Wake Up Festival in
the beautiful Rockies

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.020 align:middle line:84%
surrounding Estes
Park, here in Colorado.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So what does hatha yoga,
mindfulness meditation,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and hula hooping have in common?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's what Jocelyn
Gordon-- creator of HoopYogini--

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:90%
calls transformational fitness.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:84%
She's had over 25 years of
experience as a movement

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:84%
therapist and a
dance enthusiast.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Jocelyn is also passionate
about being fully expressed.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And also helping women
experience liberation

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
from what she
calls trauma drama.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.335 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:49.325 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JOCELYN GORDON: Thank
you for the invitation.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.576 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited about the show.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get a little
movement later on, too, which

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:90%
is going to be great.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:90%
So, what is trauma drama?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Explain this a little bit.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: OK, so I define it as
the stories that we say hold us

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.160 align:middle line:84%
back from being
fully who we are.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So, this happened
to me, this didn't

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:84%
happen to me, often
rooted in, maybe,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:90%
a small sense of victimhood.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:90%
We go through that.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:84%
But in particular,
it's the stories

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:90%
along the way, the bumps.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:90%
And then we lock--

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.133 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Yes.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --these, but
they're more so--

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.931 align:middle line:90%
sometimes very traumatic.

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Exactly, yeah.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they get
locked in, or lodged

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:90%
in the body somewhere?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.488 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Mhm.

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:30.988 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, I've
heard of it in terms

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.190 align:middle line:84%
of getting locked in the
cells, but how does it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:90%
get locked in the body?

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Thank you
for asking that.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
My experience-- and
I know you probably

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
find this too-- is that
the body holds information.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
It's clear, cells
hold information;

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:90%
our genes hold information.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And science is
constantly learning

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
how much we're holding from
our current life experience,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
as well as from our
genetic history.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So every experience we have
somehow informs the way

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:90%
we relate in the world.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the beautiful
things about yoga

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
is that it allows us to
clear the slate of what's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:90%
called sanskaras or impressions.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And those impressions
can come in, again,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
from the genetic line,
from social imprints,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.605 align:middle line:84%
and from our own
experiences in life.

00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And for, in
terms of movement,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.305 align:middle line:84%
is this how you start to
unlock those pictures?

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- Can you see
them in someone's body

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:90%
once they start to move?

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.431 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Hm.

00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
consciously say, oh, I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:90%
can tell something happened.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think we all
do that, when we're

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:84%
looking you're noticing
someone's postured, maybe

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
someone's gait, you
can tell if they're

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.467 align:middle line:84%
feeling shy or
reserved or insecure.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or holding
because an injury or two.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Or an injury, exactly.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Which, I actually just had an
injury, an accident in Asia

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.182 align:middle line:84%
in January, a
motorcycle accident.

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You were
on the motorcycle?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Yes, my
daughter and I.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It was a bit-- it was traumatic.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.761 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: But I can't-- I
wouldn't add the drama to it.

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: I mean, it was
intense, don't get me wrong.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.865 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that.

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: At least
in this experience,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.681 align:middle line:84%
I was very conscious of what was
leading up to the experience.

00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And for me
it was very esoteric.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that
I was not in my body.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I was in my mind, and I
had a pattern of anxiety

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:90%
for approximately nine months.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.125 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And-- yes, and
bodyment experts and all kinds

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:27.625 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:28.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tells all here.

00:03:28.615 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: --people have to
go through their own stories.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: But I went through a
period of nine months of kind

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
of like being anxious,
having big dreams

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and feeling under
resourced, curious.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And also feeling like I had
received this information,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
how am I going to bring
this into the world?

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was just always
ahead, ahead, ahead.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.325 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.116 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: So here we
are on this motorbike.

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I was going someplace.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:84%
My intuition said, you don't
need to go there today.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But I'd gotten so used to
it, even in those short nine

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
months, of saying, no,
push, no, push, push.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And so I pushed.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.715 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: So about
the third time

00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:03.386 align:middle line:84%
that I had the,
oh, we don't need

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
to be doing this right
now, accident happened.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I won't tell you the details,
unless you want them.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:90%
But anyway.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You got hit?

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: I hit a dog.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.255 align:middle line:90%
This is common in Asia.

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:16.974 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: But it was
really interesting,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.499 align:middle line:84%
because the dog-- as soon as we
hit the dog, the dog was gone.

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
It really almost could have been
a figment of my imagination,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.123 align:middle line:84%
except that I have scars
to prove that it actually

00:04:27.123 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So the dog came
across the street,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't go around
because of oncoming traffic.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I hit the dog, my nervous
system did like this.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And we
flew-- my daughter was

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.315 align:middle line:84%
on the back-- over the
handlebars, and onto the tar.

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I broke my chin.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:04:43.245 --> 00:04:44.965 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: And slid, right.

00:04:44.965 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter was on my back,
which is a good thing, right.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Blessing, yeah.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And however her
weight was on me, so gravity.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was a double whammy.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:90%
And she's how old?

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.721 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: She's 13 and 1/2.

00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Fortunately
she has minimal scars.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was
we were very fortunate.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
There was no-- The other traffic
was not coming behind us,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.285 align:middle line:84%
so I popped up immediately--
good old adrenaline,

00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
you have to give
thanks for that.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And scanned my daughter quickly,
so you ask if you can see.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Barely lifted her, scanned, OK.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Got myself to the side of the
road, looked at her again, OK.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.086 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:24.086 --> 00:05:24.992 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: I'm in shock.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.491 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: I'm
going to need care.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a foreign country
with my daughter.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Fortunately
everything lined up.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Clinic, good friend

Indonesian, police officer
right there, clinic

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:90%
three minutes away.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Immediately the
next day I set up--

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
that night I set up cranial
sacral sessions for both

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
my daughter and I.

could feel the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember the
surge of adrenaline

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.637 align:middle line:90%
as it coursed through my veins.

00:06:02.637 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's still
there a little bit?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Oh, it's there.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.321 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Yeah, you can feel
it, where it's like, definitely.

00:06:07.321 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So, an interesting thing about
trauma and staying in the body

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is that-- so, there were the
acute injuries of the seven

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
open wounds,
especially on my knee.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.149 align:middle line:84%
And as a dancer that
was pretty scary.

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And my foot
here, that's still healing.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And now, after a few months,
my body is telling me,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.415 align:middle line:84%
oh, you know that time when
your face hit the tarmac

00:06:28.415 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:90%
and you broke your chin?

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's there.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: So, there
is now this awareness

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:84%
of the next level of at
least physical healing

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
that needs to happen related
to the impact over there.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.002 align:middle line:84%
So I hope, somehow, that

00:06:44.002 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this is
such a great piece,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.850 align:middle line:84%
because many people who go
through car accidents and bike

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:84%
accidents, quite often, if
you're not broken boned,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.232 align:middle line:84%
you try to just
push back into life

00:06:57.232 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:90%
and pretend it didn't happen.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Yeah.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
And ignore the signs.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And even if you can't ignore
the signs, you're thinking,

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get
back into life, I've

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
got to ignore that
this happened.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you push through,
push through, push through.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, your experience
as a movement specialist,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to go through that
type of accident,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.664 align:middle line:84%
you're aware of your
healing body now.

00:07:19.664 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to yourself?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Well, I
would have to say

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm more aware of another

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:84%
as a dancer,
sprains and strains.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:90%

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
wasn't like I broke
a rib or an arm.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a cast

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
this was the least of
any kind of feeling--

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
but I think that this might
be the most impact that really

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:90%

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The jaw.

00:07:48.465 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:90%

00:07:50.076 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:90%

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:90%
I actually feel quite grateful.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:90%

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:90%
A deeper level of mindfulness.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I can say that actually,
in the last three years,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.536 align:middle line:84%
the way my intuition
speaks to me is different.

00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It used to be more visceral;
it's becoming more like this.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.763 align:middle line:90%

00:08:59.763 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I hear you.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:90%
I went through the same thing.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I had a really bad--
where I actually

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
left my body and-- a
bike accident, cycling.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.907 align:middle line:84%
And fell off a mountain,
took off out of my body,

00:09:10.907 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and watched the whole
thing from down below.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to not
have the pain though,

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
because I was experiencing
it from above.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But I lost my memory, and I
lost a lot of ability to speak.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.241 align:middle line:84%
And so I had the head trauma
that went along with it.

00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:90%
But let me ask you a question.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.115 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Yeah.

00:09:29.115 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you were
to counsel somebody who

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
comes to you, having been
through a severe accident

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and still holding the
trauma in their body,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell you?

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.641 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: What'd I'd tell-- wow.

00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:90%
These are good questions.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would encourage
an environment of safety.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes when we have
these experiences-- some cases,

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:84%
say, if you go back,
you retraumatize,

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:84%
or you want to
disassociate but it's still

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.650 align:middle line:90%
there in your subconscious.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So I would invite a
feeling of safety.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is where my meditation
practice has been so helpful

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:84%
in the inner and
outer seat of witness.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
First being in the physical
posture of witness,

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
so that it can be
adopted inside.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And a recent experience I
had, I experienced the posture

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.501 align:middle line:90%
of shame--

00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.333 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: --and the asana shame.

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So often we we're like, oh,
Tadasana or Virabhadrasana,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm a rock star.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm a warrior.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.560 align:middle line:90%
But there are other postures.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, through meditation
I was shown shame asana

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and shame asana in
my mind is coiling

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
inside oneself how
many times, infinitely.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Yet I was seated
upright, so usually what

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:84%
happens with shame is that
we get shamed-- shame.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you feel ashamed
that you feel shame,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.992 align:middle line:90%
and then you feel more shamed.

00:10:55.992 --> 00:10:57.294 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:10:57.294 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:90%

>>GORDON: And then
there's more of this.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So what's so beautiful about
finding that seated witness,

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.252 align:middle line:84%
and remembering that you have
support by the Earth-- this is,

00:11:08.252 --> 00:11:10.585 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, I'm telling
me, I'm telling everybody--

00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, exactly.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: --or reminding
us, is that you

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
can feel that support
under you, literally.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Because often the
anxious mind is there.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, this is gonna happen!

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Didn't happen.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
This happened, like OK,
can you feel your seat?

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Someone reminded
me of this when I

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
was in the midst of
being a single mom

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and freaking out when my
daughter was about five.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.316 align:middle line:84%
And he said, where
are you right now?

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is over the
phone, like, I'm in my bed.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:90%
He's like, what's around you?

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm in my house,
I've got my covers.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And that was really powerful.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So I would remind, and
bring in the witness,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
because in any kind of upright
posture-- in my experience

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
as witness-- it doesn't mean
that you become apathetic.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean
you become static.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:84%

And then there's
the internal seat.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So just like, there's
that internal--

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:90%
there could be shame asana.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
There can be the internal
seat of witness, of watching.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like you watch a movie.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.151 align:middle line:90%

the word "abuse" doesn't

felt my voice, my

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I had some cues
that this was inappropriate.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But culturally, I was like,
well this is an adult,

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.652 align:middle line:84%
they're supposed to
be looking out for me.

00:14:00.652 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this isn't--
you know, just--

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.432 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:14:03.432 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:84%

like, this is definitely not OK.

>>LISA: Wrong, mhm.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.015 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: But I had gone

00:14:11.015 --> 00:14:14.176 align:middle line:84%

I think, when I look back,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.903 align:middle line:84%

So, where was I going with that?

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So I started
teaching-- or I started

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:90%
practicing hatha and vinyasa.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.976 align:middle line:84%
I can't until I'm
a vinyasa teacher.

00:16:29.976 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I got

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and the last thing
I wanted to do

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
was teach vinyasa,
because I didn't

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:90%
want to be like a militant.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And also, I found that,
in groups with adults,

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:90%
they check out.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Because hey, you're making
decisions all the time.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.305 align:middle line:84%
Let me come into this
classroom for an hour

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.753 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:16:47.753 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Which I
understand, and I just

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
felt that it wasn't
a conversation.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So what came to me was, like,
pretty slow hatha, bringing

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:90%
in the undulation of the spine.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's harder,
in a sense, if you're

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:84%
bringing in that soft
posture with the stern focus.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:90%

based on the Yoga
Sutras of Patanjali.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And the freedom and the spiral
of the hoop, which to me

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:90%
represents the feminine.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Whereas hatha, the linear
represents the masculine.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And really, I guess,
the literal way

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
it happened was, during one

this was like at a

So it's like international

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And here I am, it's
my first performance

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.860 align:middle line:90%
in front of my peers.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Not my first teaching, but
my first performance in front

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.374 align:middle line:90%
of my peers.

00:21:20.374 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:90%
It was nerve wracking.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:90%
I was sweating, it was very hot.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And this beautiful
woman went before me,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:84%
someone I deeply admire--
and meanwhile my mind's

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:90%
like, da-da, da-da.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And then she just brings me
to tears with her hooping.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And I returned to prayer, and
in the HoopYogini posture,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
the number one pose
is Centered Pose.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So I go into my
Center Pose-- which

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.180 align:middle line:84%
is where I'm finding
myself rooted

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
in the center of my
personal universe,

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%

00:24:47.847 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You talk with your body.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:53.281 align:middle line:84%
I love this, there's
so much going on here.

00:24:53.281 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
look here at Jocelyn

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of a tutorial
here on how to use the hoop.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:58.696 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:24:58.696 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Mm.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:84%
To start the toss, allow
your hoop to go clockwise,

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:90%
have a clockwise rotation.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's in relationship
to you, the hooper,

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
the hoop is spinning in
a clockwise rotation.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the hoop
is in my right hand,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:90%
spinning to the right.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to notice
when the hoop touches

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.715 align:middle line:84%
the space between my thumb
and my pointer finger.

00:25:22.715 --> 00:25:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I press the hoop up.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So I push up through this
point-- this point right here.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:84%
You can also feel when the
hoop is going across your palm.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
That lets you know that you're
ready to push the hoop up

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:90%
with your hand.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:44.815 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:25:44.815 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:90%
So you can play with that.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Some folks have their
thumb pointing straight up.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm noticing mine goes
to the side a little bit.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.440 align:middle line:90%
So much fun doing that.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I also have a really light hoop,
so if you have a heavy hoop,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.451 align:middle line:84%
you might want to just go with
a smaller diameter and weight

00:26:09.451 --> 00:26:09.950 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.961 align:middle line:84%
So, to prevent injury, and
also so you have more flight.

00:26:14.961 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:90%
So, I push up.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Have fun with that.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to discover there.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm catching the hoop with my
right hand at 6 o'clock is it?

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.867 align:middle line:90%
6 o'clock, super star.

00:26:33.867 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So, adding on-- which is
where I'm having fun--

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.685 align:middle line:84%
tossing it up and
getting inside the hoop.

00:26:44.685 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So at some point-- so if
the hoop's right here,

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I move my body forward so
that I can catch the hoop

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:58.346 align:middle line:84%
at-- what is this,
like 11 and 1.

00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So the hoop is essentially
above you-- here

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.820 align:middle line:90%
we go, tossing it up.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have to step
forward a little.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Toss, step in the hoop.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:90%
This is so much fun.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever ever
actually sit and meditate?

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Oh yeah.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, pretty much every day.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or is your hoop
in your meditation?

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.195 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Both.

00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:28.736 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Both.

00:27:28.736 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: But the curriculum is
informed by my seated practice.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's the
tantra again, there's

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
the weaving, the
stillness and the motion.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.059 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Define tantra
for me, your words.

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has a
different definition.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.225 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Yeah.

00:27:43.225 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can't say that
I'm an expert tantric.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I can say what speaks
to me about tantra

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:84%
is that it means to
bring together, to weave.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was a time in
the yogic lineage where

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:84%
yoga went from the aesthetic,
from the masculine,

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.915 align:middle line:84%
from the-- you have
to leave your house

00:27:58.915 --> 00:28:01.969 align:middle line:84%
and give away all possessions,
and into the home.

00:28:01.969 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So you're the
householder, and that's

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
when, naturally,
women became involved.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So it was like the--
women are breathing life

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:90%
into this practice.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And then what I'm
really excited about,

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:84%
because yoga's an
evolving lineage,

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:84%
is yoga coming to
the West, and now

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:84%
the Western woman
influence on yoga, I think,

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:90%
is bringing back dance.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot like,
Shiva Rea's tantric dance.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Because it's--
once the compressions,

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and the opening, and the
twist, the hatha yoga brings,

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:90%
it activates life force.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't sit there.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.455 align:middle line:90%
Like, life force moves.

00:28:35.455 --> 00:28:36.135 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:36.135 --> 00:28:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: It undulates, and it
doesn't want to just undulate--

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.062 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: One position.

00:28:39.062 --> 00:28:40.026 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: --like that!

00:28:40.026 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In one pose
for a very long time.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Exactly.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really excited
about the people

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:84%
who will be reading
about this time in yoga.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.377 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what it will be called.

00:28:49.377 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, it also connects us back
to our tribal nature in a way,

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
You found a tribe,
you said, in Bali,

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.515 align:middle line:90%
where you live-- your tribe.

00:28:57.515 --> 00:28:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Yeah.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.835 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell us a little
bit about where you live

00:28:59.835 --> 00:29:00.790 align:middle line:90%
and what you do there.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Yeah, so I spend a lot
of time in Indonesia-- in Bali,

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Indonesia-- and just
so welcome there,

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:90%
the programs that I offer.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.809 align:middle line:84%
And also the landscape,
which is so alive and lush.

00:29:12.809 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.933 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Like, I
mean, sometimes it's

00:29:14.933 --> 00:29:17.240 align:middle line:84%
too much for my eyes,
like, it's this real.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: So it's
very much alive,

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:90%
it's very much activational.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are
three volcanoes on Bali.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really like-- for
me it's not like, oh, like lazy.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: It's very, like--

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Activ--

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.317 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Activational,
stimulating, alive.

00:29:33.317 --> 00:29:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.164 align:middle line:90%
Where were you raised?

00:29:35.164 --> 00:29:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Oh, I've moved
every two years in my life.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.232 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my gosh.

00:29:38.232 --> 00:29:40.027 align:middle line:90%
And where-- travelling--

00:29:40.027 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: So finding my
Centered Pose is very important.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.168 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:29:43.168 --> 00:29:44.504 align:middle line:90%
So you moved a lot.

00:29:44.504 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: A lot.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you said you
had to find your center.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.293 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Yes.

00:29:47.293 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And does this-- did you
learn about the spinal center

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
through your
experiences in life,

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.781 align:middle line:84%
or was it something you
created, this series we're

00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:90%
about to take a look at?

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Well, it's--
as a massage, yoga,

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and dance therapist, it's
really about the spine.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And I quickly
learned and realized

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.747 align:middle line:84%
from my teachers and my
practice that the minimal amount

00:30:06.747 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
of movement, the most
effective amount of movement

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is to move the spine in
its full range of motion.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And the spine has six
ways that it moves.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.185 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:30:13.185 --> 00:30:14.845 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And I'll show
you when we move together.

00:30:14.845 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And so
to do that, we're

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.437 align:middle line:84%
too much in a right angle, then
things get sedentary, soft.

00:30:21.437 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.436 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Nothing's
really moving.

00:30:23.436 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:90%
You're not awakened.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But if, every day at
least, you consciously move

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.780 align:middle line:84%
with your breath, your body
giving it what it naturally

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.454 align:middle line:84%
needs, there's a
natural aliveness.

00:30:32.454 --> 00:30:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well we'll take a
look at that in this video

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.450 align:middle line:84%
here from the "Spinal
Awakening" series with Jocelyn.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:90%

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, when you
practice HoopYogini,

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
find your center,

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to move
from your core-- which

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:84%
is really important as a
woman, as a being in a very

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
dynamic, ever-changing
environment.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's really important to
be in your center place

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:90%
as often as you can.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:84%
With that said, I'm going to
share with you the HoopYogini

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.550 align:middle line:90%
"Spinal Awakening" series.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a six-part
series, and today I'll

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.150 align:middle line:90%
share four postures with you.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:35.230 align:middle line:84%
As the title goes,
"Spinal Awakening" series,

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:41.200 align:middle line:84%
we're going to move the
spine in its six directions.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So I just went laterally
to one side each.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We also have forward, and
backwards that our spine moves.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And then to the side
twisting left and right.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.890 align:middle line:84%
It's highly important,
imperative even,

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to move the spine every day
to its full range of motion.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I was recently reminded
that our youth is as

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.070 align:middle line:84%
evidenced by our
spinal flexibility.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So you're only as young as your
spine is flexible and mobile.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you'll soon find
out, simply moving your body

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:84%
in these very organic ways,
with the natural, round flow

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.570 align:middle line:84%
of the hoop is going to bring
a renewed sense of well-being

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and calm in your body,
mind, energy, and spirit.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
All HoopYogini postures and
moves start from Center Pose.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and grab
your hoop, and stand

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:84%
in the center of your
personal universe.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.400 align:middle line:84%
With that, you're going to bring
your feet hip-distance apart.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:84%
All right, sometimes
us women think

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:84%
our hips are way out here--
they're not, for most of us.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So bring the feet in
just about a fist or two

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:84%
apart so that your bones
are stacked-- knees

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:84%
above ankles, hips above
knees, heart above pelvis.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.570 align:middle line:84%
You may even roll your
shoulders up, back, and down,

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.875 align:middle line:84%
and feel your shoulder blades
move in towards your spine.

00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And feel them drop
down so that you

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
have length in your
neck, length in the space

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:90%
between your shoulders and ears.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:33.220 align:middle line:84%
From here, bring your
chin back, all right.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So this way, now, our ears are
stacked above our shoulders.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And we find ourself
in Centered Pose.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and close your eyes,
and start to find or connect

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:90%
with your environment.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.465 align:middle line:90%
I like to start with sound.

00:33:53.465 --> 00:33:59.124 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.124 --> 00:33:59.624 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:33:59.624 --> 00:34:05.620 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, from the sound
outside of your body,

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.489 align:middle line:84%
draw yourself inward to
the sound of your breath

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:15.150 align:middle line:84%
moving in and out of
your body, and really

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.835 align:middle line:90%
hear and feel that breath.

00:34:16.835 --> 00:34:30.159 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Next, imagine that
you have nostrils

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.369 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of
your feet-- this

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:38.020 align:middle line:84%
is a pretty fun and
funny illustration--

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and from those nostrils
at the bottom of the feet,

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.639 align:middle line:84%
and from a very slight
bend in your knees,

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:48.235 align:middle line:84%
and a slight bend in your
tail, see, imagine, and feel

00:34:48.235 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
the in-breath traveling
up the length of your body

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:84%
while you're in Centered
Pose, extending up

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:90%
through the top of your head.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, in your own
timing, feel, hear,

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.150 align:middle line:84%
see, and imagine the
breath coming down

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.250 align:middle line:84%
the midline of the
body and out again

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.085 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth through the feet.

00:35:09.085 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, so
I thought we would just

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.887 align:middle line:84%
take this up, and try
this thing, do this thing.

00:35:14.887 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
You're going to help
me because I'm nervous.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: All right.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, so--

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Yes.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --what
are we doing here?

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: OK, so,
first thing, and always

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.440 align:middle line:84%
what we return to-- so we
have the pun with the hoop--

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.750 align:middle line:90%
is our Centered Pose.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: So first,
find yourself

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.550 align:middle line:84%
holding the hoop
at 3 and 9 o'clock,

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.586 align:middle line:84%
and bring your feet
about hip-distance apart.

00:35:35.586 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Feel free to lift your toes,
spread them really wide.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And now bend your knees
so you're nicely buoyant.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Tuck your tail.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I call this sitting in your
queen seat, or your throne.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Take your throne.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, with an inhale,
roll your shoulders up.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.893 align:middle line:84%
And exhale, drop
them back and down.

00:35:52.893 --> 00:35:53.392 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:53.392 --> 00:35:54.716 align:middle line:90%
Feel better all ready?

00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:58.135 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, deep
breath really does a lot.

00:35:58.135 --> 00:35:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And I
like to imagine I

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.490 align:middle line:84%
have nostrils on the
bottom of my feet.

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.889 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to join me,
you can bring the breath up

00:36:03.889 --> 00:36:05.430 align:middle line:84%
through the full
length of your body.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:84%
With the inhale, roll
the shoulders up.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.601 align:middle line:84%
And then exhale, follow the
breath back down to the earth.

00:36:11.601 --> 00:36:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Because, often, we're breathing
a short breath up here.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So just one more
time, up from earth--

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:90%
nice, long, central, beautiful.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.252 align:middle line:90%
Good, shoulders back and down.

00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:23.585 align:middle line:90%
Now we have the heart is lifted.

00:36:23.585 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:90%
We're saying yes to life.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing is
to bring our chin back

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.547 align:middle line:84%
and our ears right
above our shoulders.

00:36:30.547 --> 00:36:32.505 align:middle line:84%
At the same time that
you're feeling your feet,

00:36:32.505 --> 00:36:35.140 align:middle line:84%
you feel the top of
your head reaching up.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is the HoopYogini
equivalent of Tadasana.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: All right.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's here that, when
we have our bones stacked,

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.610 align:middle line:84%
we are putting our posture in
the present moment awareness.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
fake it till you make it.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.439 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It feels great, yeah.

00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:51.272 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: It feels good,
like, OK attention!

00:36:51.272 --> 00:36:51.813 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:36:51.813 --> 00:36:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: But, hey.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most people walk with
their heads forward right now.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:56.315 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Mhm,
often in the future.

00:36:56.315 --> 00:36:56.898 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:36:56.898 --> 00:36:59.375 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Or some people
are anticipating the future,

00:36:59.375 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
or some people are
stuck in that thing that

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.854 align:middle line:90%
happened, or didn't happen.

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, posture of
present moment awareness,

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.630 align:middle line:90%
available to you at any time.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Great.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So in your present
moment awareness,

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:84%
just give it a second to--
how do you feel, Lisa?

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:90%
You might feel a little hot?

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I feel it, yeah.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:90%
It's warm in here.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.065 align:middle line:90%
It's getting warmer, yes.

00:37:19.065 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Feels good.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.025 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Feels
great, feels great.

00:37:22.025 --> 00:37:23.500 align:middle line:90%
And easy, too.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.396 align:middle line:84%
Head really floats when it's
right on the right axis.

00:37:27.396 --> 00:37:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Yes,
that atlas, orbit,

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.280 align:middle line:90%
or where they're supposed to be.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So now, from here, we will
link movement with breath--

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.910 align:middle line:84%
just like we do in traditional
hatha yoga practice.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Bring your breath in and up
from the earth, and inhale,

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.310 align:middle line:84%
lift your arms up overhead while
keeping your shoulders down.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So here's our first challenge,
because often-- and exhale

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:84%
here, bring your hoop
down to Centered Pose--

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in modern life,
what's happening?

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:52.560 align:middle line:90%
This.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:52.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:37:52.825 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: This.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:90%
This.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So we keep affirming
this upright posture.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, hoop up, shoulders down.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.620 align:middle line:84%
This is called a Breathing Lift
in the HoopYogini curriculum.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:02.895 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:02.895 --> 00:38:04.644 align:middle line:84%
And you're not holding
it with your thumb.

00:38:04.644 --> 00:38:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: And exhale down.

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So, this is-- we're
going into a flow touched

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
upon in the tutorial,
but we'll give it

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.362 align:middle line:84%
a little more oomph in
real time, because we

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:20.140 align:middle line:90%
have real live bodies here.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, one more time.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Inhale up from the earth, lift
up, keep the shoulders down.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And now as you exhale,
push into the hoop,

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:84%
like as if you

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:90%

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.388 align:middle line:84%
Bring in your ujjayi,
your oceanic breath.

00:38:35.388 --> 00:38:40.870 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:41.596 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:38:41.596 --> 00:38:43.645 align:middle line:84%
And as you follow
that breath, push out

00:38:43.645 --> 00:38:45.700 align:middle line:84%
so that you're pushing
out your energy field

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.700 align:middle line:90%
through the compression.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.784 align:middle line:90%

00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:55.875 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is great for someone who
might have carpal tunnel, where

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:84%
their wrists are
constantly flexed.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:84%
This resistance helps
to open and create

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.440 align:middle line:90%
space between those small bones.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in, shoulders down.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And last time, breathing
out, pushing out, good.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Now let's be happy and inhale.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Reach up through the fingers.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%

Do you feel the healthy

>>GORDON: Good.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:90%
So again, lightness and ease.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:57.283 align:middle line:84%
So all of our postures are
supposed to be easy, and also

00:39:57.283 --> 00:39:59.598 align:middle line:90%
effortful, so bring that down.

00:39:59.598 --> 00:40:01.913 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:07.351 --> 00:40:10.216 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: So now adding
on, inhale, lift up.

00:40:10.216 --> 00:40:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Puff out your energy in
all directions-- nice.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Now push it out and exhale,
bring your energy to your core.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.229 align:middle line:84%
Inhale now, and hold on
the outside of your hoop.

00:40:21.229 --> 00:40:22.270 align:middle line:90%
So we'll work different--

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: --different

>>LISA: OK.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.206 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: And push in.

00:40:26.206 --> 00:40:28.025 align:middle line:84%
So now we're working
across the heart.

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Before, we were
working the back.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:34.251 align:middle line:84%
So just this posture is like,
(GASPS) powerful, right?

00:40:34.251 --> 00:40:34.792 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:34.792 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like a Greek goddess.

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Yes,
you look that way.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.911 align:middle line:90%
And connected.

00:40:39.911 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the spine moves
in six directions,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.350 align:middle line:90%
I was sharing that with you.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:47.240 align:middle line:84%
We will move our
spine left and right.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's lateral
flexion, left and right.

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:90%
That's two out of the six.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we have our extension,
where we're leaning back.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Woo, feel that?

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.585 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And then our flexion,
where you round forward,

00:41:01.585 --> 00:41:03.546 align:middle line:90%
and fold in half.

00:41:03.546 --> 00:41:05.390 align:middle line:90%
And then press into the feet.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, lift up.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Switch hand positions.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:90%
Return to your Centered Pose.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.605 align:middle line:84%
And now bring yourself
into the lateral rotation--

00:41:15.605 --> 00:41:16.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:16.105 --> 00:41:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: --known as Twist--
which are great for digestion.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:84%

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: It was just-- the

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great for the back.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Oh, yeah.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.444 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just get
this in your hands

00:41:26.444 --> 00:41:27.690 align:middle line:90%
and you start to do stuff.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm not kidding.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:90%
You start to do stuff with it.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.023 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: This is also
squeezing the kidneys

00:41:32.023 --> 00:41:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and massaging the
adrenals, which are usually

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.990 align:middle line:84%
highly active because you're in
a fight or flight quite often.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Great.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:90%
So this is called Center Twist.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.177 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is great, and this

00:41:46.177 --> 00:41:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GORDON: Yes.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.766 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: OK, so those are the
six movements of the spine,

00:41:49.766 --> 00:41:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and this curriculum
takes the body

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.790 align:middle line:84%
through those postures
in various ways.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.751 align:middle line:84%
So I want to bring
in something special.

00:41:55.751 --> 00:41:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Actually, let's do this.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:57.520 align:middle line:90%
So keep twisting.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: This is a really good

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And now plant your

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:07.470 align:middle line:84%
but let the hoop
continue its momentum

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.093 align:middle line:84%

its natural pause

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:10.640 align:middle line:84%
without you having

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.480 align:middle line:90%

everything has its own
timing, and everything

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.550 align:middle line:84%

should, when it should.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.798 align:middle line:90%

That was very
beautiful and elegant.

00:43:19.314 --> 00:43:22.500 align:middle line:90%
And then you twist it out again.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you can lift
it up, and then you

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.206 align:middle line:84%
can bring it into an
arabesque or a jette.

00:43:27.206 --> 00:43:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%

>>GORDON: Exactly.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.180 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Yeah.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:00.275 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is isolated movements

It really is.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And you don't use resistance

>>GORDON: You can.

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Isometric contraction,

glute goes down.

working in layers,

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.310 align:middle line:84%
because when you do have
the muscle memory, then

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.910 align:middle line:90%
we bring in the breathing.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So then now, the
brain is like, OK you

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.980 align:middle line:84%
want me to do this and
breathe fully and then--

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Dance.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: --what we do,

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:42.605 align:middle line:90%
hard to get back there.

00:47:42.605 --> 00:47:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's gentle.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Yeah,
gentle compressions.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, especially when you
bring the hoop to the pelvis,

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:84%
then your reproductive
organs become more nourished.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.647 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: And so the
hatha yoga practice, I

00:47:56.647 --> 00:47:59.090 align:middle line:90%
was like, oh, OK, stretching.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, I got in the hoop,
and I had a pretty big Eureka

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:04.800 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: It didn't
take too long for me.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But again, I've been
dancing my whole life.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But I spend a lot of
time teaching adults

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.480 align:middle line:84%
how to hula hoop and how
to teach other adults how

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to hula hoop as a
therapeutic practice.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Kids get
this really fast.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON: Because
they're uninhibited.

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:22.214 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you, Jocelyn.

00:48:22.214 --> 00:48:26.360 align:middle line:84%
You're amazing, you're inspiring
especially, especially.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.470 align:middle line:84%
