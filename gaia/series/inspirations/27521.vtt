00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:90%
The statistics are staggering.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Worldwide, obesity has
doubled in the past 30 years.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
In 1980, one in six
Americans were obese.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And today, that number
is one in three.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's 10
pounds or 100 pounds

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that you're struggling with,
it's important to address what

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:90%
got us here in the first place.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today to help us
crack the weight loss code

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:84%
is author and medical
intuitive, Caroline Sutherland.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
She's here to help us
understand our own body,

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and really listen
to what we need

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:90%
to live vibrant, healthy lives.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful
to be here, Lisa.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much for having me.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm so-- and your
energy is so abundant.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.715 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that you--
I mean, you've just

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:90%
been bouncing around all day.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.044 align:middle line:84%
So, you walk your talk.
I know that.

00:01:07.044 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
I try to do that.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
have great energy,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.767 align:middle line:84%
you have to do some of the
simple follow-the-basics.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
going to cover today.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk a
little bit about how

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
we got to this place,
where you even said,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
two in every three
people are overweight.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- that's
not the obesity scale,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:84%
but that are
actually overweight.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:90%
How did we get to this?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
What do you
attribute to the fact

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:84%
that Americans have
increased in weight so much?

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are lots of
components to weight loss,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm one of the few people
that feel that some really

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:90%
practical suggestions.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And they don't include
calorie counting, and saying,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:90%
no, and over exercising.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
There's some really
basic things that I like

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:90%
to follow and teach people.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that is happening now

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
is we have so many refined
foods and so much exposure

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
to carbohydrates and GMO foods,
and just a heavy, heavy hand

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:90%
with carbohydrates.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Not enough exercise, of course.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the other components
that we're going to get into,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
about the hormone imbalances,
and so many other issues,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
that people are just
simply not aware of.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And, I like to teach a
different method of weight loss.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.601 align:middle line:84%
It's far, far different
from everybody else.

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So, I want to mention to
people, for sure, that this

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:90%
is a critical conversation.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
This is not about
losing 10 pounds.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
This is not about
making people feel

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:90%
bad, if they are overweight.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:90%
This is a lifestyle.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about diet--
-Yes.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
 --today.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a way to
save your life at this point.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what I love?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
If you take it to
a higher level--

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
if you always take
everything to a higher level,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:90%
then it makes sense.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm all about
people fulfilling

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
their passion and their
destiny, and people

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:90%
really living their best lives.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And when this happens, it's the
motivating factor, how people

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:90%
will put these pieces together.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
it's a very, very high

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:90%
level of personal self-mastery.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, mastery
over the emotions.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Mastery over what we're
putting in our mouth.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:84%
That's a very high level
of personal mastery.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we can
motivate people to say,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:90%
you'll have a great body.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have lots of stamina,
lots of energy, mental clarity.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:90%
You'll start feeling better.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, the person
is motivated to do what they

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:90%
want to do with their lives.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:90%
And so, there's always a payoff.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about, well, let's
stay away from these foods.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's make this maybe
be difficult or a bit

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.030 align:middle line:90%
of a penance.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's make it fun
and interesting,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
because the byproduct
is always going to be

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:90%
greater energy for the person.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well, you've outlined
a great PowerPoint for us

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being able
to make this simple

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and to really digest
this information.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So, what are the
top five reasons

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
why you think people
are struggling

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:90%
with this particular problem?

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the big one, of
course, is cravings.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
You cannot stop a
craving, any more

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:90%
than you can stop a sneeze.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a biological,
basic inbuilt

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:90%
need that the person has.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, you have to
be able to teach them

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:90%
how to stop those cravings.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And saying, no, is
not the way to do it.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Sitting and chewing on
celery sticks will not do it.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So, I have-- for
example, I have drops

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:90%
that I encourage people to use.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I really encourage
people to respond

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:90%
immediately to a sugar craving.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Always respond with a protein.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I had a
little blood sugar drop,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and knew that I
needed something,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I would never
respond with anything

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:90%
that was sugary or sweet.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I would always respond
with a protein,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
like a handful of walnuts,
or a cold chicken leg,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:84%
or a hard boiled egg--
LISA GARR: Now why is that?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:90%
 --or something like that.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
pancreas, you see.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
The pancreas takes the
food and breaks it down,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and creates glucose out of it.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And the pancreas supplies
glucose to the brain.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's necessary for
any thinking or any acting.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It's all done with this supply
of glucose to the brain.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the pancreas does.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
It takes the food,
breaks it down,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:90%
and supplies it to the brain.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
most efficient supply

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
of glucose in the
brain is going to come

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.611 align:middle line:84%
from the breakdown of protein.
-Is that right?

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:13.485 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-OK.

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So, that's the best
thing to reach for if you

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
have that blood sugar drop.
-Yes.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is not to eat
the sugar in the first place,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.551 align:middle line:84%
so that the blood sugar
doesn't spike as much.

00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:84%
To keep the balance
through the day.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Breakfast-- start with
a great breakfast.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
You know the British were
always on to a great breakfast--

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:84%
scrambled eggs, and kippers,
and all kinds of things--

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Porridge.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
 --porridge, that you
wouldn't ever think of having.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.691 align:middle line:84%
And we start our day with
coffee and a muffin--

00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Doughnuts.
- --doughnut.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're wondering
why we have no energy,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and then the person needs
more caffeine, and so it goes.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:10%
Well, there are components to a
successful weight loss that you

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:10%
have put together for
us, and most of it

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:10%
has to do with identifying
what your food allergies are.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.197 align:middle line:10%
And, that's the first thing.

00:05:56.197 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:10%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: So,
the first thing is the food

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:10%
allergies and sensitivities.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:10%
And if you want to, we
can go into those now,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:10%
or I can just give
you the brief list.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:10%
Whatever you'd like to do.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:10%
Let's start with the
brief list real quick,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:10%
and then we'll break
these down individually,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:10%
and give people a full
analysis of all of it.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.491 align:middle line:10%
So, food allergies.

00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:10%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: So, it's
knowing and understanding food

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:10%
allergies and what they do.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course,
Candida yeast,

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:10%
which I believe is really
in back of those cravings,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.747 align:middle line:10%
cravings for starches
and cravings for sugars.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: It's a big topic.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.913 align:middle line:10%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
And then keeping

00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:10%
the carbohydrate grams low.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:10%
That's the starch
and sugar, again.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:10%
Keeping that amount low.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:10%
And then exercise,
daily exercise.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Something that the person
would really like to do.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course, the fifth
component is hormone balancing.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Now, let's start
off with the food allergies.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.489 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Why do you think that
people are allergic to foods

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
that we-- all of a sudden
allergic to foods--

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
eating for centuries?

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's related to stress.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So, if there's stress,
then the immune system

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:84%
becomes suppressed, and
then we have way more

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:90%
intolerance, more reactivity.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Not only are we
reacting to foods,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
but we're reacting to chemicals,
and pollens, and things

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in the air, that we didn't
before, when we didn't

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:90%
have this high level of stress.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And also, multiple exposures.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
If you think of a very
common sensitivity,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
say, for example,
to wheat and flour

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
based products, the exposure
over and over exposed

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
to those particular
grains, that grain,

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:90%
that causes a sensitivity.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:84%
The body just breaks
down and says,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:84%
you know, I can't
take this any longer.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
You're giving me too
much too many times.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Are people maybe
that are older more prone

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
to having an
intolerance, maybe 40, 50

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
years of eating and,
kind of, bludgeoning

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
the body with wheat products?
-That's right.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So, a person, I would
say, they can go right

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
through, with no
problems at all,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
usually until about
the age of 40.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's when the gate closes.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.957 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 40, well,
we've got some problems here.

00:07:49.957 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly
what happened to me.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And let's start
taking care of it.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But up until 40, you can,
kind of, hang out and do

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.610 align:middle line:90%
pretty much whatever you want.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But as a person progresses in
age, because all of the body

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
processes, and the actual organs
themselves aren't functioning

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.210 align:middle line:84%
at the optimum level
that they did when

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:90%
we were much, much younger,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So, how would
one know that they have

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
a gluten intolerance,
or a wheat sensitivity,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:90%
or a dairy sensitivity?

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's start with wheat,
because that's a big one.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So, wheat, for example,
the person will be tired.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
they might experience

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.860 align:middle line:90%
is foggy thinking.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So, they'll be thinking, now
I can't complete a sentence,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and I'm feeling fuzzy, and
I can't grasp for a word.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So, foggy thinking, and the
fatigue, and then, of course,

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:84%
the big one as we
progress in age,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:90%
joint stiffness and arthritis.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:90%
So, there are many other ones.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Poor absorption of
nutrition, for example,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:90%
not absorbing well.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Nails are cracking, and eyes
are getting a little bit dim.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a byproduct.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that I'm
most interested in

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
are the joint
stiffness, the fatigue,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:90%
and the foggy thinking.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the weight gain,
because if you put in a food

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that your body doesn't
like, your immune system

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:90%
starts to react.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the person
will gain weight because

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:90%
of the release of histamine.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So the immune system reacts,
histamine is released,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.045 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course, the
byproduct is fluid retention.

00:09:09.045 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting,
and we just call this,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.087 align:middle line:90%
oh, we're just getting older.

00:09:12.087 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: No,
it's nothing to do with it.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.253 align:middle line:84%
-It's not that at all.
-Yeah.

00:09:15.253 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Figure it out, and
start to take the things

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
out, and make other changes.
-OK.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the person will
start feeling better.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Their joints won't be as stiff.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So, what I love about it is
it's so universally simple.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:90%
You think of the universe.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:90%
The universe is very simple.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
If you need
something, it's there.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So, don't you think that it
would be a given, for example,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
if people are having
health problems,

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
just to maybe examine
food as a possible cause

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:90%
of health problems.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's confusing a little
bit, because you've said,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
up until 40-- I mean, you
go through your 20's, 30's,

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
you can do whatever
you want, your body

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
has this beautiful, innate
intelligence to just

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
heal, repair, homeostasis.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.877 align:middle line:90%
It wants to thrive.

00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Yes.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And then it does that for 30.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:90%
40 years, and it just breaks.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:90%
So, it is confusing.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
You're triumphant
for so many years,

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
thinking everything
is going to be great.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of
a sudden, it says,

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:90%
that's not happening anymore.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the body
has that built in capacity

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:90%
to repair at any age.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it, with 60-year-olds,
70-year-olds, 80-year- olds.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's great.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So, that's something that we
can really hang onto and be

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:90%
really, really grateful about.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I'm
glad you said that.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about
one of the other things,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:90%
which would be dairy.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want-- I'm not sure
whether this is the moment

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to show the different
foods-- but I

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
was going to say, for example,
bread, for example-- something

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
that everybody knows--
that bread for someone

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:90%
can make them tired.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice that, if
you have a sandwich at lunch,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:90%
and you start feeling tired.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:90%
So bread will do it.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Pasta, for example, is
another wheat product.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:84%
That can make a
person tired as well.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Biscuits, buns,
cookies, all of that.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Those are all made
from wheat flour,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I was
talking about-- those three

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:84%
different symptoms.
-OK.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Dairy is interesting,
too, but it

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:90%
affects the respiratory tract.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:90%
It affects breathing.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So, when a person
is having asthma,

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%
or they're not breathing
well, and they're

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:84%
having a lot of milk-based
products, then look to dairy.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Now how is that--
-Right--

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:90%
 --a factor in weight gain?

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at the
North American diet industry,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:84%
the number one diet food is
going to be low fat cottage

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:90%
cheese or string cheese.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you think of it,
the milk product from a cow

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
is actually designed
for baby cows.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not designed
for human beings.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So, we're much more
reactive to cow's milk

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:90%
than we would be to other milks.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Because of the fact of the
way the cow forages for food.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It goes through one stomach,
and then it becomes milk.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Where, if you use goat cheese,
or if you use goat's milk,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the goat has three
different chambers.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, by the time it
actually becomes milk,

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:90%
it's pre-digested.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we can usually
handle those kinds of milks,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and where we can't
with cow's milk.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a big, big
sensitivity is the dairy.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You have a
list here of the foods--

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:84%
the most common food allergies
and sensitivities for people.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.860 align:middle line:90%
Dairy, as you mentioned.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.693 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Yes.

00:12:05.693 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: And then, the--

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Wheat flour.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Corn is a big one.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So, here we have--
everyone loves it.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Now why would corn be an issue?

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Corn, in our culture,
is really genetically

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:90%
modified, most of it.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And really corn is a sugar.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
It's widely used in
the baking industry.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, because it's a cheap
filler, and so it's a sugar.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.311 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as the person
has the sugar, all they want

00:12:28.311 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:90%
is more.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And, just like you
said, an insulin spike.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So, as soon as
insulin is spiked,

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
bam-- that person
just wants more sugar.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So, if you have an insulin
spike, respond with a protein,

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.371 align:middle line:84%
brings the blood
sugars back down.

00:12:40.371 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of neat.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.503 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Where would
you put milk, and so

00:12:42.503 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:90%
forth, in the corn products.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
it's actually adding
insult to injury, isn't it?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, milk and a corn
product, I think would be

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.397 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a double whammy.

00:12:49.397 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But here's what I
think you could do.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.181 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's what
baking products are.

00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But if a person wants to
have corn, for example,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
then put out a bowl of
popcorn, for example.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Then put a bowl of
nuts out, along with.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So, you're having a little
couple handfuls of popcorn,

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe you're
having some toasted cashew

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:90%
nuts or something, along with.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And that way you're
balancing your blood sugars.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you also have
sugar and coffee over there.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.804 align:middle line:84%
I do, so, and
everyone's is thinking--

00:13:13.804 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Coffee's my favorite.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
 --oh, man, what
are we going to do.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the thing.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:90%
So, here's regular sugar.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And, I don't think
there's anything

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:84%
wrong with having a sweet
dessert once a week,

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
or once every 10 days.
Fair enough.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:90%
We have to live in the world.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.807 align:middle line:84%
Life is wonderful.
-Thank you.

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are
many things that we

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
should be enjoying
on an irregular

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:90%
basis, an occasional basis.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's totally fine.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:90%
But, it will spike insulin.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
You will want more when
you have a sweet dessert.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:90%
What about honey?

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Honey, agave nectar, all of
those different sweeteners,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.361 align:middle line:84%
all will give an insulin spike.
-Same thing.

00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Even stevia.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
But stevia is really the most
benign of all the products.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Even xylitol is too, when
they are permissible.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But they will still
spike insulin.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
keep the sweet receptors

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:90%
switched on.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you don't want.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.290 align:middle line:84%
You want to shut down
those sweet receptors,

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
so that you can pass a
bakery, pass a chocolate shop,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
pass any of those
kind of goody places,

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't pull you
in, and call you in.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Now this is for people
that want to lose weight.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's also for anyone who
wants to have great energy.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So, coffee what it does, is it
literally will strip your body,

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and take energy away
from you, because it

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:90%
affects the adrenal glands.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And your adrenal
glands are your fight

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
or flight special
glands that protect

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:90%
you in stressful situations.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, what you do by having
regular coffee is knocking out

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:84%
those adrenal glands, which then
the person wants more coffee.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
They want more sugar
to bring them up.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So, what I suggest for
people is switch down

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:84%
to something like a
really tasty French roast

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:90%
decaffeinated coffee.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
have the caffeine,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:90%
but it still has a taste.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
sort of soothing,

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:90%
and mellow, and nurturing.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And people want the taste and
the smell of the caffeine,

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
need the downside.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I don't
like about caffeine

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:84%
is it affects the
lymphatic system.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you think of
women and breast tissue,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:84%
there is no delineation
between breast

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:90%
tissue and lymphatic tissue.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And caffeine affects
the lymph, and we know

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:90%
that, because of mammograms.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And they tell you,
don't take caffeine

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:84%
24 hours before your
mammogram, because it

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:90%
will be more painful.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:90%
So, we know that--

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:90%
 --just from mammograms.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.061 align:middle line:84%
What about tea and the
caffeine from tea or black teas?

00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Green teas?
-Well, it's the same thing.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say it.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.530 align:middle line:84%
It does the same thing
to the lymphatic system.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So, once in a while, I
think, once in awhile,

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.171 align:middle line:84%
maybe once a week, have
a caffeinated product.

00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Fair enough.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But during the
week, while you're

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to gather
your energy back,

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:84%
your body is so precious
and so important,

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and to really care for it
and nurture it and not keep

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
knocking it out with these
stimulants that just make us

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:90%
more fatigued and wear us down.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:84%
That is part of the
American diet, what

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:90%
you have going on over there.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.306 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Yes, it is.

00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:84%
What about one of
my favorite foods,

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:84%
that I don't eat any
longer, because I

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:90%
am gluten free-- pizza.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the thing.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:84%
If you have a family, and
you're all going to a party,

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and you go to a pizza
place, maybe once every two

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:90%
or three weeks, fair enough.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel bloated,
and you're going to feel gassy,

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and there you've got the
exposures to the dairy

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:90%
and the wheat in one meal.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But we have to, again,
live in the world.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you're having pizza
more than once every 10 days

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:84%
or two weeks, you will
end up retaining fluid,

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and then having
at least two days,

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
you know, 48 hours, to be able
to expel that retained fluid.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So, that's the thing of just
watching what you can get.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.831 align:middle line:84%
Now many pizza places now
have gluten free crusts.

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, you could
get the tomato sauce.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
You can get all the
different toppings.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe avoid the cheese, or take
your own little bag of grated

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
up goat cheese, and put
it on yourself at the end.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But you can still do
pizza and avoid it.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But I would say to people,
have the regular pizza.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Just don't have it that often.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It takes two days to detoxify
pizza out of the body?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It will take two days.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see you're
going to retain fluid

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.586 align:middle line:90%
from the histamine reactions.

00:17:03.586 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, you retain the fluid,
and then, if you don't have

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:84%
any offending
foods for 48 hours,

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:84%
then the body just
releases that stored fluid,

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and you just urinate it out.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:84%
That'll be-- for example, if
a person goes, for example,

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:90%
to Thailand for a vacation.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, isn't
that interesting?

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I was in Thailand,
and I lost 10 pounds.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Now how could that be?

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
They weren't exposed
to gluten there.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:84%
They weren't exposed
to milk products.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
They had coconut milk,
and they had rice.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So, they didn't have
these histamine reactions.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what causes
this fluid retention, which

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:90%
is not fat, but it's fluid.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I call
the great fat fluid myth.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:90%
It's really a myth.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.721 align:middle line:84%
But when people from
other countries come here,

00:17:46.721 --> 00:17:47.420 align:middle line:90%
and they have--

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
They gain weight.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
 --hamburgers and French fries.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And they eat pizza,
and sandwiches--

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and ice cream.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:90%
They gain weight.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.597 align:middle line:84%
-And desserts.
-Yes.

00:17:54.597 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about desserts,

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
if we can, because
it-- basically,

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
desserts have all
of the things you

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.773 align:middle line:90%
just mentioned-- dairy, sugar,

00:18:01.773 --> 00:18:02.906 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
That's right.

00:18:02.906 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: --wheat,
many different things.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.857 align:middle line:90%
Well, the fruit's good.

00:18:06.857 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
So, what could you do.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So, let's say you
went somewhere.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
You went to a wedding
or you went to a party.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And there was a dessert.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Just monitor your blood sugar.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Just notice how you feel.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel a little bit
tired, craving more sugar.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So, as soon as you get
home, have something

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that's protein based,
like some nut butter,

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:90%
on the end of a spoon.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And just balance out
your blood sugars,

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and that will help
with the effect

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:90%
of having that sugar spike.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:90%
What do you eat?

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a
pretty regimented diet.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's not difficult. So, how
many times a day do you eat?

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:90%
I eat whenever I'm hungry.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I eat three meals--
breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and a mid-morning,
mid-afternoon snack.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I always have, and
this is contrary to all

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:90%
of the diet gurus.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But I always have a late
night before bed snack.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And that might be about two
tablespoons of goat yogurt

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
with a little
sprinkling of cinnamon,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and about four pecans.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit to balance my
blood sugars through the night.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So, that you maintain
your sugar levels, so--

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.153 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Yes.

00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
 --you'll wake
up starving, or--

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.103 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Yes.

00:19:07.103 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And you sleep very
deeply, because you

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.644 align:middle line:90%
don't have the blood sugar.

00:19:09.644 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, when your
head hits the pillow,

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and you get this pounding,
that's a blood sugar drop.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So, if you feel that,
you just check yourself

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
before you get into bed.
-Interesting.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.851 align:middle line:84%
And you say, now
how am I feeling?

00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Am I hungry?
I'm a little bit hungry.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:90%
So, you always go for a protein.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Don't go for a
banana, for example,

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that'll just make it worse.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.529 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, interesting.
-Yeah.

00:19:26.529 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So, of all the things
that contain the wheat flour,

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:84%
what about the products
that you mentioned

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:84%
that are gluten free, breads
and gluten free crackers,

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
They tend to contain
many different grains.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's actually--
on the one hand, it's good.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So, it's really
exciting that there

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
are many gluten free products.
LISA GARR: Yeah.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So, that's what
the wonderful part.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:84%
The downside part is that people
think, oh, it's gluten free,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.930 align:middle line:90%
I can have as much as I want.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:84%
It's still going to be
high in carbohydrate.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So, keep the carbs low of the
gluten free items as well.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're often
very overly processed.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:90%
They have added sugars in them.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to look to
see what you're getting.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
But they're a good
idea as long as people

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.581 align:middle line:84%
don't go overboard and have
too many carbohydrates.

00:20:09.581 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So are you suggesting that
if you cut these things out

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
of your diet, if you cut
out the wheat and the sugar,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.897 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, and the
pastas, and the dairy--

00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Yes.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
 --that somebody
will lose weight?

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:84%
In your practice, have
you experienced this?

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's other things
that have to be done.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to
stop the cravings.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's Candida yeast.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And also, you really need to
look at thyroid and hormones.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And they should be exercising
about 15 minutes a day.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Either a brisk walk, or a swim,
or just a little bit of a gym

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:90%
workout, even a home gym.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But, one of the reasons why
people can't lose weight,

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that's because their thyroid
isn't functioning properly,

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and/or their hormones
are out of balance.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about that today--

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:84%
 --because that's a
very big conversation.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.129 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But, I want to
just stay focused

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.521 align:middle line:84%
real quickly on that list
that we had mentioned-- soy.

00:20:57.521 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.991 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about soy--

00:20:59.991 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:10%
 --because there's a big
controversy around soy.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:10%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Well,
soy can be problematic.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:10%
I don't think there's anything
wrong with an exposure

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:10%
to soy here or there,
or a little sprinkling

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:10%
of soy sauce on your food, I
don't think that's the problem.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.880 align:middle line:10%
It's the slabs of tofu, and the
constant using soy milk here

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:10%
and there, and soy lattes,
and that sort of thing,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:10%
because soy suppresses
thyroid function.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And it affects the way the body
absorbs iron and B vitamins.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And those are your
building block vitamins.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
They give you your juice, your
zip, your joy, and your energy.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:90%
They boost your energy.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, what soy will do is,
will be suppress that function,

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and you can't absorb
iron and B vitamins well.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, it
suppresses thyroid function.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And the thyroid, if
the thyroid is low,

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
then the person is going to
be poopy, droopy, draggy, low

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:90%
energy, and we don't want that.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:90%
So, that's interesting.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So, soy also is
considered-- the body

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
goes into an allergic
reaction to it?

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can have
an allergic reaction.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But it really has an
estrogenic effect as well.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
It contains estrogen. And,
for example, in Israel

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and in Germany,
they have actually

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:90%
banned soy infant formula.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.890 align:middle line:84%
There are very large labels
on soy infant formula

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
that this can raise
estrogen levels in a baby,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:90%
and to be aware of that.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And people in North
America, potentially,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:90%
may not be aware of that.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
That's also-- I
read a statistic

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
about that contributing
to obesity in children.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because it
raises estrogen levels.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Just the way-- in the
regular animal production,

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:84%
conventional production
of beef, for example,

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
they give the cows estrogen
to increase their body weight.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, estrogen has
an estrogenic-- I mean,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:84%
soy has an estrogenic effect,
which then can increase

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:90%
the size of the person.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.951 align:middle line:84%
Now, you mentioned
eating protein regularly.

00:22:53.951 --> 00:22:55.821 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Do you eat meat?

00:22:55.821 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I went back to eating
red meat many years ago .

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- I was a--
I wasn't a vegetarian,

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.770 align:middle line:90%
but I was a fringy vegetarian.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of fish and vegetables and
beans and that sort of thing.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And my energy was
dropping, and I

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
was getting wider and
wider, which for me is

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:90%
not that much to become wide.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:84%
When you're little, you can
really feel five pounds.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to
eating red meat,

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and it made a huge
difference in my energy.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And I do see that
in certain people.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Especially, with certain ethnic
origins that the red meat

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:23.911 align:middle line:90%
would be helpful for them.

00:23:23.911 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's interesting.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.381 align:middle line:84%
So, it really is
different for every body--

00:23:26.381 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: --which is
very important to know.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But, in terms of the beef, you
mentioned that there's a lot

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:90%
of hormones in the meat--

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So, you want organic and
hormone free, as best you can.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:90%
As best that you can.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And usually, lamb, for
example, is red meat.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Lamb is usually brought
in from New Zealand,

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and they don't use hormones
at all in New Zealand.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And most of the lamb
production in the United States

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:84%
is usually on farms that
are a little bit more

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.244 align:middle line:84%
conscious about what they're
doing with hormones, and feed,

00:23:57.244 --> 00:23:58.709 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of thing.
-Yeah.

00:23:58.709 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:84%
That's a tough one.
-It is hard.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It is difficult. But
it's not for everybody.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But for some people, it
can make a huge difference.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: You're right.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk
a little bit more

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:90%
about the alternatives here.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So, the alternatives to
cheese that you mentioned,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:84%
there is goat's cheese.
-Yes.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: An alternative to
milk would be goat's milk?

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Goat's milk.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:84%
There's sheep cheese and
goat cheese for cheese.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
there's rice milk.

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:90%
There's almond milk.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.400 align:middle line:90%
There's hemp milk.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
There are different
milks that can be used,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and you can use goat
milk, and lots of children

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.620 align:middle line:84%
respond extremely
well to goat milk.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.991 align:middle line:84%
What about the goat milk,
which I find a little bit--

00:24:36.991 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:84%
it's got a--
-Goatee.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
A little tangy.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.590 align:middle line:84%
-That's right.
-What about feta?

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Is feta a low moisture cheese.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is it any better?

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, it has to be goat feta.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful
sprinkled on a salad.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually make
grilled cheese with goat feta.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's fabulous.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.620 align:middle line:84%
You put a little
slice of tomato,

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and if you have a little--
whatever you want-- pastrami

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
and then load it up

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:84%
with the feta on the top,
and put a couple basil

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:90%
leaves underneath.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And put it on the grill,
and oh, man, you don't

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.340 align:middle line:90%
miss grilled cheese at all.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:90%
So, there is no bread on that.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, you'll have a piece
of gluten free bread.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been great with
making sandwiches with lettuce.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I've made lettuce
sandwiches forever.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Wraps, roll things up.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:84%
They're so great.
When you take--

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.607 align:middle line:84%
 --big pieces of
lettuce, and you stack

00:25:18.607 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:84%
everything you want
in there, and you

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
just eat it like a sandwich.
-That's right.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a little messy,
but it's really good.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It's very good, and
you get very creative.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you're out, and
you are not at home and not

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.750 align:middle line:84%
able to prepare your
meals, it's a good thing

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.027 align:middle line:84%
to go-- you can go
to a sandwich shop

00:25:32.027 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and make a lettuce sandwich.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you absolutely can.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
the gluten free alternatives

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:84%
in terms of crackers
and so forth.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:40.684 align:middle line:90%
Is rye OK?

00:25:40.684 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:10%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Well, now
here's the interesting thing

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:10%
about rye.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.875 align:middle line:10%
It is a glutenous grain.

00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:10%
There are four
glutinous grains--

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:10%
wheat, oats, barley, and rye.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:10%
But rye is the lowest
form of gluten.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:10%
So, if you imagine rye flakes,
if you get whole rye flakes,

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:10%
and you put them in your
hand, you mix them with water

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:10%
and squeeze them together,
when you open your hand,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:10%
every single flake
will be separated.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:10%
But, if you do the
same thing with oats--

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:10%
we know rolled oats-- and
you mix them with water,

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:10%
and you squeeze
your hand, you'll

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:10%
have a ball, literally in your
hand, the shape of your hand.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:90%
So, they're very low in gluten.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And unless a
person's celiac, they

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.190 align:middle line:84%
really will be able to tolerate
100% rye, rice crackers.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of wonderful
sweet potato chips,

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.179 align:middle line:84%
Different vegetable chips
and vegetable crackers.

00:26:26.179 --> 00:26:27.245 align:middle line:90%
So, there are many alternatives.

00:26:27.245 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:90%
But again, keep them low.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:90%
They're high in carbohydrate.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:90%
What about quinoa?

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.919 align:middle line:84%
Is that a good one?
Is that--

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Quinoa a wonderful grain.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can make it, for
example, in place of porridge

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:90%
or in place of oatmeal.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Cook that quinoa, and then
put some coconut milk in it,

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and chop cashew nuts, and a
little sprinkle of cinnamon

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.430 align:middle line:90%
on the top.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:90%
You're in heaven.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:90%
We're getting recipes, too.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:84%
That sounds really great--
-Yes.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
 --for a morning breakfast,
because there's a little

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.033 align:middle line:90%
protein in quinoa, isn't there?

00:26:52.033 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:90%
There is protein.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I always recommend that people
have a little extra protein

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:90%
alongside.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:84%
The quinoa may not last them
more than an hour and a half,

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and if they have a
blood sugar drop,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
they might need a little
bit of extra protein.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, barley,
you mentioned barley.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Now-- what's the difference
between wheat and gluten?

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, gluten is
part of the wheat.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not a difference.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So, when something
says wheat free,

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
is it different than
being gluten free?

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
If it's wheat free, then that
means there is no wheat in it.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:84%
W-H-E-A-T. You could check to
see, but usually, if it's wheat

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:84%
free, it's gluten free as well.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.339 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:27:26.339 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But what you don't want is, you
don't want gluten free wheat,

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:84%
because the wheat
itself will trigger

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:90%
the very same reactions.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:84%
The gluten feeds the
yeast, and contributes

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.460 align:middle line:90%
to the cravings for sugar.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But the wheat itself is the
part that causes the symptoms.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:84%
The foggy thinking, and the
stiffness, and the fatigue.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about--
you had mentioned Candida,

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:52.447 align:middle line:84%
and Candida being the main
source of weight gain.

00:27:52.447 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Explain that, if you can.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a really big deal.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:84%
In North America, we
have such an exposure

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.110 align:middle line:84%
to antibiotics through the food
chain, and by prescription.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So, we're literally
over using antibiotics.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So, when that happens, it throws
off the flora in the colon.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's a mixture
of beneficial and not

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:84%
so beneficial bacteria that
reside naturally in the colon,

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.730 align:middle line:90%
which is the large intestine.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
then is this Candida

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:84%
yeast, which is
always present, it

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.650 align:middle line:90%
gets into an overgrowth state.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And when it's in an
overgrowth state,

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
the person craves starches,
and they crave sugars.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:90%
That's all they want.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.244 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're saying,
you can't beat the cravings.

00:28:30.244 --> 00:28:31.956 align:middle line:84%
-That's right.
-The body is doing it for you.

00:28:31.956 --> 00:28:32.656 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:28:32.656 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
an organism within,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and then you're just feeding
it with all the starch and all

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.080 align:middle line:84%
the sugar, even the good
sugars and allowable sugars,

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.490 align:middle line:84%
like we talked-- agave
nectar and honey.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And those will still feed it.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:90%
And fruit will feed it as well.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So, this Candida yeast
is really important.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a cornerstone
for what I do.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I just-- it comes to me, and
it's come to me for many years,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.140 align:middle line:90%
as a scent.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a smell that comes
right off the body.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I smell it,
then I know that person is,

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:90%
I say, going down.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, where are they going?

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Their memory's going.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Their energy is going.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting
to gain weight.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, as soon as
I smell it, I say,

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:84%
oh, oh, we've got
to grab this one,

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.340 align:middle line:90%
and arrest it, and keep it down.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So, you do that with
certain supplements

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:84%
that are antifungal,
anti-Candida supplements.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, the diet, of course,
not having a high amount

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:90%
of sugar and starch.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And usually, within
the first four weeks,

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:90%
those cravings go away.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And the person starts to
bring their energy back,

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:28.860 align:middle line:90%
and they feel better.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.886 align:middle line:84%
And when we come back, we're
going to talk about some

00:29:31.886 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:84%
of the supplements that
Caroline Sutherland recommends.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And ways to reduce the
Candida in the body,

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:90%
which is very, very important.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.551 align:middle line:84%
Talking about cracking
the weight loss code.

00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:44.931 align:middle line:84%
We'll be right back.

you could find thousands
of videos devoted

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:90%
to really changing your world.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.050 align:middle line:84%
What if this channel
offered programming

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:84%
that cared about the things
that mattered most to you.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Your well being, your
community, and the world beyond.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.350 align:middle line:10%
Most people really are
thinking the same way every day,

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.840 align:middle line:10%
acting the same way, and
feeling the same way,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.500 align:middle line:10%
but really hoping
something will show up

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.530 align:middle line:10%
differently in their
life, and it never does.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.190 align:middle line:10%
And, what if it was
also dedicated to yoga,

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:16.210 align:middle line:10%
fitness, and alternative
approaches to health.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.200 align:middle line:10%
You don't focus on
what holds you back.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.870 align:middle line:84%
You focus on what's
already there.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.070 align:middle line:90%
History and spirituality.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Ego is the belief that
you are separated from God,

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.530 align:middle line:84%
which is the most
terrifying thought

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:90%
that could ever happen to us.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.700 align:middle line:84%
SPEAKER: What if it
offered solutions to many

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.860 align:middle line:90%
of the problems we face today?

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.050 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that
there is something

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:10%
I don't fully
understand about life.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.250 align:middle line:84%
The understanding of which
would change everything.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:84%
SPEAKER: What if it went
that extra mile to help

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:90%
you find passion and purpose?

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:10%
When you're doing what you're
supposed to do, doors open.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
SPEAKER: What if
this channel didn't

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:84%
have any ads, and instead,
used its valuable air time

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.040 align:middle line:90%

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.980 align:middle line:84%
You'll accomplish so
much more if you're happy.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.080 align:middle line:84%
SPEAKER: Entertained

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.650 align:middle line:10%

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.060 align:middle line:10%
We started this film by asking,
what's wrong with the world?

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up discovering
what's right with it.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.870 align:middle line:90%

Welcome back.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:84%
My guest is medical intuitive,
Caroline Sutherland,

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
cracking the weight loss code.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
She gave us a little cliffhanger
right there before the break.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.370 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
Candida, and solutions

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:84%
for Candida, which Caroline
says is a weight loss epidemic.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So, tell me a little bit
about solutions for Candida.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You think, about how many
people do you think have--

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I'd say it's universal.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:10%
I could just sit literally,
on a bench, under a tree,

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:10%
and I could help people with
Candida yeast, literally

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.890 align:middle line:10%
every single day of the week.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.631 align:middle line:84%
And if I did nothing else,
I would be able to do that.

00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:17.578 align:middle line:84%
And that's all.
LISA GARR: My goodness.

00:32:17.578 --> 00:32:18.277 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:32:18.277 --> 00:32:19.620 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
So, it's universal.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And I believe is the cornerstone
behind excess body weight,

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and very few people
are addressing it.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:84%
You look at all the
mainstream diet books,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.800 align:middle line:90%
and it's not listed.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not mentioned at all.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.400 align:middle line:84%
It's all about calorie counting,
and eating a celery stick,

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and saying no.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that to people.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to give
them lots of food,

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
help them with where

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.580 align:middle line:90%
these cravings are coming from.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Now does that
Candida weight show

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.810 align:middle line:90%
up primarily around the belly?

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.120 align:middle line:90%
It can be anywhere.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It can really be anywhere.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just the fact that you
have-- as soon as you stop

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.490 align:middle line:84%
the cravings, you
empower people,

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.940 align:middle line:84%
because what happens
with cravings--

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:01.940 align:middle line:84%
it's like a huge specter that
hangs over the person's head,

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and they just think
of food all the time.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:90%
They wake up thinking of food.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:84%
They go to sleep
thinking of food.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:90%
And they never are separated.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle line:84%
They're never away
from this huge,

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:84%
kind of, overlying specter, if
you will, of wanting to eat,

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.060 align:middle line:90%
and needing to eat.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's not them.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:90%
They blame themselves.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, it's my
grandfather or my grandmother.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing to do with them.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It's an organism that
lives inside them,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that they have to wrestle
literally to the ground.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And you do that by keeping
the starches and sugars low,

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.020 align:middle line:84%
making sure you're having
a balanced diet, protein

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.010 align:middle line:84%
at every meal, not
a lot, but just

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:39.430 align:middle line:90%
enough to balance blood sugars.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you use
certain supplements

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.880 align:middle line:90%
to arrest this process.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll talk about
the metaphysics of it,

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and because we can
do that on this type

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:90%
of a television program.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Really, the metaphysics
of Candida yeast

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.320 align:middle line:90%
is really the death process.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the breakdown
death and decay

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.960 align:middle line:84%
process, that's
natural and inherent

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.350 align:middle line:90%
within the human being.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So, what we want to do is
arrest that break down process.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.200 align:middle line:84%
We want to keep it down
until we've finished

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.175 align:middle line:90%
our mission and our destiny--

00:34:07.175 --> 00:34:07.941 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:84%
 --which is each individual's
own thing that they want to do.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Something they're
passionate about.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And Candida is in
men and women alike?

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, babies, grandparents.

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.370 align:middle line:90%
You look at a nursing home.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.960 align:middle line:84%
All that is is people
that are full of yeast.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.659 align:middle line:84%
Literally, their bodies have
broken down to such an extent,

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:27.860 align:middle line:90%
they can't think for themselves.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.850 align:middle line:90%
They can't function.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And they've all
made a commitment

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.699 align:middle line:84%
to gather in that one
place, and wait to die.

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, because you'll
go to see someone in a nursing

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.639 align:middle line:84%
home, you open the
door, and all you

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:84%
can smell is a wall of
yeast. and that's what it is.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:42.699 align:middle line:90%
It's rampant in older folks.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, all
they want is sugar.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:90%
All they want is starch.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
feeding that yeast.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.409 align:middle line:84%
But what I find really
amazing about it,

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.989 align:middle line:84%
is a precursor to all
the major label diseases.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest one,
of course, is cancer.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And why is it that we have
this huge epidemic of cancer?

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, cancer cells
are fed on sugar.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.240 align:middle line:90%
They love sugar.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.450 align:middle line:84%
That's all they want to
grow and proliferate.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have a high
starch, high sugar diet,

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.760 align:middle line:84%
which I believe is the main
reason for the amount of cancer

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.830 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our society.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, all
of the wheat products,

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:84%
which are filled with sugar,
have to do with the Candida.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:20.711 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk
about some solutions.

00:35:20.711 --> 00:35:21.850 align:middle line:84%
What to do.
What to do.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you mentioned a few.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's-- rattle them off to us.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.010 align:middle line:84%
What are five
solutions for Candida.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So, first thing to
know-- could I potentially

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:84%
have an overgrowth
of Candida yeast?

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So, there's two symptoms
you want to look for.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:84%
One is overwhelming desires
for starch and sugars.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And the other one is fatigue.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Is a person tired?

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:90%
And are they craving?

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So, if you can answer
either of those two

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:90%
questions, then, OK, good.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So, now I have lots of
things on my website

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that people can just go
to the health food store,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and lay out all the products
that they have for Candida

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.291 align:middle line:84%
yeast control, and then pick the
one that feels right for them.

00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Intuitively.
Instinctively.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Or to even ask about it.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And so, some type
of a supplement

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:84%
would be really, really--
that's the obvious thing.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people will
come to me and they'll say,

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Caroline, I've been
doing the Candida

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:90%
diet for the last three years.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And how is it that in me
you're detecting that I'm

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.560 align:middle line:84%
still dealing with yeast?
-Right.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, that'll come by a smell.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.514 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's a smell
that I can pick up.

00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:21.280 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.390 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: And so, the
thing that they weren't doing,

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.890 align:middle line:84%
is they weren't taking
the supplements.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.510 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So, the supplements
that you mention here are

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.121 align:middle line:90%
Apa-Trol drops that help you--

00:36:29.121 --> 00:36:30.820 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Those
are little special drops

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.420 align:middle line:84%
that you can't get anywhere
else, except for on my website.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.871 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry to say.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:36:34.871 --> 00:36:36.650 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: But
they block the desire

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:37.960 align:middle line:90%
to overeat starch and sugar.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:90%
They contain neurotransmitters.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:84%
There are little homeopathic
drops, and are very helpful.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.216 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But that
doesn't actually address

00:36:42.216 --> 00:36:43.210 align:middle line:90%
the problem though, right?

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.310 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: It
helps you as you're starting

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.770 align:middle line:90%
to get it under control.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So, as you're starting to take
the Candida yeast supplements,

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:90%
you use the drops.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you're starting
to change the diet

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and get the sugars
and starches down,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:84%
then the drops can help you
through that initial five,

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:84%
six week kind of process.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
of the supplements then.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:04.450 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Yes.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:05.090 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You've mentioned
yeast supplements.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:06.440 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
What will knock it out?

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.500 align:middle line:84%
OK.
Good.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.160 align:middle line:10%
So, the one I like is
grapefruit seed extract,

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:10%
either tablets or capsules.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The drops taste bad so I
don't recommend the drops.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:84%
The other one I like very
well is oregano oil capsules,

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.791 align:middle line:84%
that will work well if a person
has a little bit of strength

00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:24.490 align:middle line:90%
to their body.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.974 align:middle line:84%
If they're fragile,
and they, kind of,

00:37:25.974 --> 00:37:27.240 align:middle line:84%
might be a little
bit reactive, you've

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:90%
got to watch it with that.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Another one that I like
very well is Powdearco.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Powdearco is a
type of a herb that

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.780 align:middle line:84%
comes from South
America, that is

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:41.290 align:middle line:84%
very helpful for fungal
and Candida conditions.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, I also like, for
people that are fragile,

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:84%
or nursing mothers, pregnant
mothers, or children,

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:84%
is a homeopathic
that's designed to get

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Candida yeast under control.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:90%
And you never get rid of it.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.110 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So, it's interesting.
It's always there.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's interesting.
You always have to maintain it.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the maintenance, yes.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Does it cause arthritis?

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Does it cause osteoporosis?

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not a cause of it.
LISA GARR: OK.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But, it can contribute
to joint stiffness.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think of
our digestive tract wall,

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:15.570 align:middle line:84%
it should be strong,
and it should

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
have very good skin tone, and
be very tight and very strong.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But what happens as
we progress in age,

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.740 align:middle line:90%
it becomes holey or permeable.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And then these undigested food
molecules and yeast spores

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:90%
pass through the GI tract wall.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.950 align:middle line:84%
That's what leaky
gut syndrome is.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.621 align:middle line:84%
And people have heard
of leaky gut syndrome.

00:38:32.621 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:84%
-Very painful.
-So, these-- Yeah.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.580 align:middle line:84%
They pass through
the GI tract wall,

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and then they get
into the bloodstream.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, then the
immune system reacts.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you have the
joint stiffness, and the pain,

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.254 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to Candida.

00:38:45.254 --> 00:38:47.120 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because
there's a lot of prescription

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.310 align:middle line:84%
drugs for things like
leaky gut syndrome,

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:50.277 align:middle line:90%
or irritable bowel syndrome--

00:38:50.277 --> 00:38:51.110 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Yes.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.090 align:middle line:90%
 --and so forth.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend going
after those drugs?

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Or do you recommend going
after the supplements

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:57.090 align:middle line:90%
to kill the yeast?

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, I really like probiotics.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.890 align:middle line:84%
If you use probiotics, and
you use an anti-fungal,

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and you eliminate
the glutinous grains,

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and get the sugar way down,
you start to repair that gut.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's the whole thing.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.070 align:middle line:90%
The gut is really the center.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.505 align:middle line:84%
People will say, well,
I've got something going on

00:39:14.505 --> 00:39:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and I can't think
clearly in my brain,

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
take a supplement.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I would go directly
and work gut.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I would work gut for
arthritis, or anything related

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.990 align:middle line:90%
to the brain, or energy.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.990 align:middle line:90%
Skin even.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Anything on the skin
is related to the gut.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So many people think,
well, skin is skin.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.170 align:middle line:90%
No, uh-uh, it starts here.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:32.501 align:middle line:84%
Oh, skin, talking about
eczema and things like that.

00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
That's yeast related.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Candida yeast.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And milk and dairy products
is a killer for that, right?

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, put it this way.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:43.540 align:middle line:84%
They are not as bad as the
starches and the sugar.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But remember that
milk has milk sugar,

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:84%
so it will feed Candida yeast.
Yes.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So, then would
rice milk, as well?

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.610 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Rice milk,
I hate to say it, but will.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.740 align:middle line:84%
See, that's the thing with a
lot of those alternative milks--

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.439 align:middle line:90%
Almond milk?

00:39:55.439 --> 00:39:57.260 align:middle line:84%
They have-- almond
milk, probably not,

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.570 align:middle line:90%
unless it has added sugar.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:90%
But rice milk has rice syrup.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to look very-- once
you get the idea, the education

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
of the picture, the broad
view, then the choices

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.520 align:middle line:90%
are more easily made.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But people just don't
have-- they think, OK,

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.490 align:middle line:84%
well sold in a health food
store, and it should be good,

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and it's a milk alternative.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes, but it does contain sugar.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.424 align:middle line:84%
What about cultured foods
for yeast infections?

00:40:20.424 --> 00:40:21.690 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
Well, some people

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:90%
really like cultured foods.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's where certain foods
like cabbage can be fermented,

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:90%
and beets can be fermented.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Other people react to them.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
individual choice.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And there is actually a big
culture of cultured foods.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.220 align:middle line:90%
And people are very into it.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
quite interesting.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of work,
so it's not necessarily

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:41.216 align:middle line:90%
everyone's cup of tea.

00:40:41.216 --> 00:40:42.349 align:middle line:84%
Well, it builds
a community, too.

00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:90%
It does build a community.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
definitely some truth

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.130 align:middle line:90%
to this whole gut area.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.965 align:middle line:84%
And reestablishing beneficial
bacteria is what it's called.

00:40:51.965 --> 00:40:54.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.740 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I introduced
you as a medical intuitive.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't touched on
that in this interview.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to have you just
talk about that a little bit.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely want to have
the conversation about thyroid,

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:90%
and the hormone balancing.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But all of the information
that you're giving us,

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.420 align:middle line:84%
is it based on your career
as a medical intuitive,

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.710 align:middle line:84%
in helping thousands
and thousands of people?

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about what that is.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really based
mostly on my clinical days,

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.860 align:middle line:84%
where I had 55,000 patient
visits under my belt

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.670 align:middle line:84%
before I left a clinic.
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I was an allergy testing
technician for medical doctors

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:27.190 align:middle line:90%
and naturopathic physicians.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of
hands-on patient work,

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
where all of the testing would
show the food sensitivities,

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.290 align:middle line:84%
all of testing would
show candida yeast,

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:90%
and different imbalances.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, I was
part of, and able to see,

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.580 align:middle line:84%
what would happen
to the patients

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.050 align:middle line:90%
after they were treated.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So you just learn so
much in so many years,

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.270 align:middle line:90%
just solid, solid learning.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's really that clinical
background that gives me

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.860 align:middle line:90%
the foundation for what I do.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:90%
But I pick it up instinctively.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I really do feel
that my instincts

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.710 align:middle line:90%
are very finely honed.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
honed for correction.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested
in what is wrong.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I just go in with the
attitude and the knowledge,

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.390 align:middle line:84%
the real knowledge, that the
body has a capacity to repair.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.860 align:middle line:84%
It will repair at any age,
if we give it the tools.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And candida yeast and food
sensitivities literally are

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.520 align:middle line:90%
the cornerstone of what I do.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I do other things as well,
but those two things are

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.880 align:middle line:90%
done for every single person.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.695 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes what
I find is people

00:42:25.695 --> 00:42:28.430 align:middle line:84%
will come to me after
they've seen practitioners,

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and I've asked them, well,
has anybody helped you

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.460 align:middle line:90%
with your food sensitivities?

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody helped
you with your yeast?

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, you know,
this practitioner

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:38.180 align:middle line:84%
said we'll be getting
to that next month,

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.760 align:middle line:90%
or maybe in six months' time.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I like that to be
dealt with right away.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:42.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: First thing.

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So people do go to
practitioners for things

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.895 align:middle line:84%
like thyroid imbalances
and hormone imbalances.

00:42:46.895 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.811 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So this is a major
contributor to weight gain--

00:42:51.811 --> 00:42:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
---is an out-of-balance thyroid?

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, I love
to talk about that.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And here's something really
simple that everyone can do.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Take 10 days-- just
think of a 10-day window.

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself a
basal thermometer--

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that's a type of a
thermometer that shows

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.790 align:middle line:90%
the little tiny increments.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And take your body temperature
first thing in the morning,

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.710 align:middle line:84%
before you put your
feet on the floor,

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:16.050 align:middle line:90%
before you get out of bed.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Put a piece of paper and
a pen on your nightstand.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Take your temperature,
record your temperature.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And your normal body
temperature is 98.6.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So if anything lower than
98.6-- and a lot of people

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:84%
have low body
temperature-- 94, 95,

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:36.160 align:middle line:90%
96, low 97, not even high 97.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
low body temperature,

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:41.420 align:middle line:84%
that's a sign that the thyroid
is not functioning properly.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And if that thyroid is
not functioning properly,

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.450 align:middle line:84%
the person will be tired,
they won't have a great mood,

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.360 align:middle line:84%
they'll be draggy, they'll
just feel as if they're really

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.840 align:middle line:84%
not participating in
life, and, of course,

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.430 align:middle line:90%
they'll have this weight gain.

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So the thyroid is a
really big factor.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would say I see that as
a problem in 90% of the people

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.600 align:middle line:90%
that I see every year.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.861 align:middle line:84%
And I see between 3,000
and 5,000 people a year.

00:44:05.861 --> 00:44:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh yes, I've had hands on
now about 150,000 people.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And I see in 90% of
them that thyroid

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:14.500 align:middle line:90%
is not functioning well.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Why is it not functioning well?

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:22.070 align:middle line:84%
It's all related to stress,
and the expenditure of power.

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
adrenals are knocked out,

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and the person is stressed,
there goes thyroid function.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.570 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you said
expenditure of power.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Personal power, or energy?

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Expenditure of power, which
means, yes, if the person is

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:84%
invested, you know, in a
person, a place, a thing,

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:84%
very invested,
say, in their job,

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and they lose energy
themselves, then that thyroid

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.610 align:middle line:90%
goes down because of stress.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about
the supplements,

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.310 align:middle line:84%
like the prescriptions,
and the Synthroids,

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.010 align:middle line:90%
and those types of things?

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend
that for people?

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.093 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: Well,
first of all, I'm not a doctor,

00:44:53.093 --> 00:44:56.540 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not qualified to be able
to make a determination there.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But doctors really
like synthetic thyroid,

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.720 align:middle line:84%
which is going to
be Synthroid or it's

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.340 align:middle line:90%
going to be the levothyroxine.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.680 align:middle line:84%
They like that because
it's easy for them

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.940 align:middle line:84%
to be able to calibrate
it and to test it.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.770 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:12.050 align:middle line:84%
But there are some long-term
side effects of that, namely

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.920 align:middle line:84%
bone density, and the fact
that the thyroid kind of says

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.490 align:middle line:84%
to itself-- and this is just a
simple way of saying it-- well,

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm on that supplement,
so I can go to sleep now,

00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and I don't really have to do
anything to support myself,

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.410 align:middle line:90%
meaning thyroid.

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I like a glandular, I
really like a porcine or

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.760 align:middle line:90%
a bovine glandular for thyroid.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course--
and this sounds odd--

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:36.830 align:middle line:84%
but a glandular that's
made from animal tissue

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:41.020 align:middle line:84%
actually is a really very
good match for human tissue.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And I do find that
people respond

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:47.480 align:middle line:84%
incredibly well from bovine
or porcine thyroid support.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But people can use kelp, they
can use combination herbs.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:90%
They can try different things.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you take your
body temperature for 10 days.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:84%
If it's low, then start
taking kelp, maybe one cup

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.660 align:middle line:84%
with breakfast.
Wait a week.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.790 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Tablets?

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.284 align:middle line:90%
Tablet or caplet.

00:46:03.284 --> 00:46:04.150 align:middle line:90%
What's more concentrated?

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Tablet or capsule,
concentrated.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.420 align:middle line:90%
And then do that for a week.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Test again with the
temperature of the thermometer.

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe raise
it to two breakfast.

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:15.740 align:middle line:90%
And then check again.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:84%
It might have to be two
breakfast, one lunch.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you one
thing that will really

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:23.080 align:middle line:84%
bring thyroid function
up is to get the amount

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.770 align:middle line:90%
of starch and sugar down.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:29.410 align:middle line:84%
That supports thyroid function,
as well as reducing stress.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.560 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Overall,
a weight solution

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.585 align:middle line:84%
is to reduce the
amount of carbohydrates

00:46:33.585 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:90%
that you're taking in.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.534 align:middle line:90%
But not a zero-carb diet.

00:46:36.534 --> 00:46:38.100 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: I
don't think that's good.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:38.800 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.130 align:middle line:90%
No carbs, I think, is not good.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't just like a lot
of protein and vegetables

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.770 align:middle line:90%
for people over and over again.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.010 align:middle line:84%
They do have to have
some carbohydrate,

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:49.990 align:middle line:90%
because carbohydrate is a fuel.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And some people can
actually feel worse if they

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.150 align:middle line:90%
have almost no carbohydrate.

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:56.215 align:middle line:90%
Other people can feel fabulous.

00:46:56.215 --> 00:46:57.915 align:middle line:84%
It's very individual, you
know, the body does know.

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.710 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I got stuck
in that with just protein

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables and
got stupid, because I

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:05.150 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any brain power for,
yeah, from the carbohydrates.

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you see,
it's so individual.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
find your own level.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I find if people do that,
the way to correct it

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:84%
is just four tablespoons
of brown rice at each meal.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:15.574 align:middle line:84%
And that usually is
enough to bring it up.

00:47:15.574 --> 00:47:17.040 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Sweet potatoes,
things like that.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to stay on the
thyroid conversation--

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.560 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: --because
it is so important.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.460 align:middle line:90%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: It is.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.050 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned
before iodine.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so for people
with Hashimoto's, is

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.441 align:middle line:90%
iodine recommended?

00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:27.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've heard
about the controversy.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Hashimoto's
thyroiditis really is

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.010 align:middle line:84%
something that
should be treated,

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.800 align:middle line:90%
well, obviously by a physician.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have to
consult with a physician.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Because there is an
aspect of it that may not

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.530 align:middle line:90%
be useful for certain people.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:43.420 align:middle line:84%
But low thyroid
is so very common.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think if people
do a simple iodine test

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.210 align:middle line:84%
by doing that little test
patch, the little test

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.080 align:middle line:90%
on your inner arm.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And if that patch disappears
within eight hours,

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.430 align:middle line:84%
then that is a sign that you
could be deficient in iodine.

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:58.330 align:middle line:90%
And so many people are.

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, having iodine at
the optimum levels in the body

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.570 align:middle line:84%
is really a
cancer-protective mechanism.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And we know this from Japan when
they had the nuclear reactor

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.280 align:middle line:90%
meltdown there.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.060 align:middle line:84%
They gave everybody
iodine tablets, because it

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.590 align:middle line:84%
was cancer-protective.
-Interesting.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So I understood, why are
we so deficient in iodine?

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Talk a little bit about that.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And why do they add
iodine to table salt?

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, we don't
have iodized salt really

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.800 align:middle line:90%
available to us any longer.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
having artisan salts,

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing other things
with salt that's not iodized.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And also they add bromide
to the wheat, wheat flour,

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.140 align:middle line:84%
as a type of a
stabilizing agent.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.555 align:middle line:90%
So it's added to wheat flour.

00:48:43.555 --> 00:48:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And we have so many
wheat products,

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.150 align:middle line:90%
as you know, in our diet.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:51.431 align:middle line:84%
And so this bromide, it
robs the body of iodine.

00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:52.560 align:middle line:84%
-Interesting.
-Yes.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.560 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So the wheat
correlation has to do

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.930 align:middle line:90%
with the iodine deficiency.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that the
people from the Midwest origin

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.687 align:middle line:84%
tend to be a little bit
more deficient in iodine.

00:49:02.687 --> 00:49:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And then that carries
throughout generation

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
to generations as well,
because of the lack

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.970 align:middle line:90%
of sea salt. Correct?

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, that was the
thing that was done, you know,

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.850 align:middle line:90%
much, much earlier.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Up to probably the
1980s, there was iodized

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.070 align:middle line:84%
salt. And now people are
staying away from salt.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:19.890 align:middle line:90%
They're not even using.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So, oh, salt is bad--
no, salt is not bad.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Salt is a trace element,
and it's very necessary.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.120 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: If you crave
salt, does that maybe

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.820 align:middle line:90%
indicate an iodine deficiency?

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.460 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
It's usually

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.230 align:middle line:84%
a vitamin-mineral
deficiency, craving salt.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:33.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's not necessarily related.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.826 align:middle line:84%
It's not a salt
deficiency. [CHUCKLE]

00:49:34.826 --> 00:49:36.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not related to iodine.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:38.270 align:middle line:84%
However, you could use
iodized salt. You could

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:41.045 align:middle line:84%
use more sea vegetables,
and little dulse,

00:49:41.045 --> 00:49:41.850 align:middle line:90%
there's little dulse--

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:42.880 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Dulse is great.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.325 align:middle line:84%
---little flakes
that you can get,

00:49:44.325 --> 00:49:45.225 align:middle line:90%
and sprinkle on your salad.

00:49:45.225 --> 00:49:46.459 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
things you can do.

00:49:46.459 --> 00:49:47.491 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: That's really great.

00:49:47.491 --> 00:49:48.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of great
solutions you've got.

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a lot about
hormones, and hormone balancing.

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.859 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a big deal
LISA GARR: It is.

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.960 align:middle line:84%
That's a knotty subject--
starting with a K

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily
an N. But you know,

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.760 align:middle line:84%
hormones are naughty as
well, and they should be.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But hormone balancing is a
really an important aspect

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.120 align:middle line:90%
of aging well.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And I feel so grateful
that I've been

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.280 align:middle line:84%
doing natural plant-based
hormone balancing myself.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But when you think
of weight gain,

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.480 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot to hormones
involved in that.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, of course, when
people have excess body weight

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.440 align:middle line:84%
is too much estrogen
in the body.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, is
called estrogen dominance.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is excess fatty
tissue that's around the waist

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.880 align:middle line:90%
that's loaded with estrogen.

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Also around the
arms, for women.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.900 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: It
can be in the arms as well.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It can be anywhere in
the body, but mostly

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.110 align:middle line:90%
around the midsection.

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So getting hormones
balanced is important.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:47.550 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest one for weight
gain is really that thyroid.

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And so if the person,
once they do, for example,

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.160 align:middle line:84%
a low-carbohydrate diet, once
they start correcting candida

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.460 align:middle line:84%
yeast, once they understand
that exercise is important,

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're keeping
their carbs low,

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing
everything right,

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:05.610 align:middle line:84%
the glitch is going
to be in the hormones,

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:07.294 align:middle line:90%
if it isn't successful.

00:51:07.294 --> 00:51:08.060 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Interesting.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So how would you even
approach hormone balancing?

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And how would you know
that you're out of balance

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:14.030 align:middle line:90%
with estrogen dominance?

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, I really
think for hormone balancing,

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to consult
with a physician.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:21.145 align:middle line:84%
They're the only ones that
can really prescribe hormones.

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:22.970 align:middle line:90%
And then start with testing.

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So for example, here's
a hormone-- cortisol.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:28.380 align:middle line:84%
If cortisol levels
are high at night,

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.330 align:middle line:84%
then you won't be
able to lose weight.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol levels have to
be high in the morning.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll have a
better chance of having

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.620 align:middle line:90%
your ideal body weight.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It's because of cortisol levels.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
stress-handling hormone.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And because we have
mega-stress, not necessarily

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.700 align:middle line:84%
in our personal
lives, in our world,

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.820 align:middle line:84%
our world is
incredibly stressful.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And this program, Gaiam,
really sheds a light

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.530 align:middle line:84%
with so many authors and
speakers about what we can do

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.970 align:middle line:84%
to be more conscious
and more aware of what's

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:58.120 align:middle line:90%
going on in the world.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.850 align:middle line:90%
And so we feel the stress.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:02.750 align:middle line:84%
We may not have it in our
own lives, personally,

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:90%
but we feel it.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.680 align:middle line:84%
It's an undercurrent
under everything.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.549 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing is stable.
Everything--

00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Even watching TV before you go
to bed, with watching an action

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.460 align:middle line:84%
movie or TV show, or the news,
it raises cortisol levels,

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.160 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything has
destabilized, easily

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:84%
within the last 10 years,
more so than ever before.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we're
experiencing that stress.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:23.357 align:middle line:90%
And so that throws off hormones.

00:52:23.357 --> 00:52:24.723 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: What do
you mean destabilized?

00:52:24.723 --> 00:52:25.580 align:middle line:90%
---as well.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, just the amount of
upheaval in our world.

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is for
certain any longer.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.760 align:middle line:84%
In one way, it's a good thing,
because we're metaphysical.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So to be in the moment, of
course, is a wonderful thing.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But on another
level, it gives us

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.050 align:middle line:84%
sort of an underlying sense
of potential fear-- you know,

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:46.135 align:middle line:90%
what could be happening next.

00:52:46.135 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
things happening,

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.220 align:middle line:90%
so what could be happening next?

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And what could be happening
to us individually?

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So all of those things
raise the cortisol

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.570 align:middle line:84%
levels in the body,
of course, before--

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the stress.

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:57.460 align:middle line:90%
---before sleep.

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:02.001 align:middle line:84%
So that is another contributing
factor to weight gain.

00:53:02.001 --> 00:53:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So what are some
suggestions to be

00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:08.090 align:middle line:84%
able to lower the cortisol
levels before you go to sleep?

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Not read your email. [CHUCKLE]

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:10.980 align:middle line:90%
No, get to bed early.

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a wonderful
key, to reset your body clock.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Get to bed early
around 10 o'clock,

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and get up early with the
birds and the sunlight,

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and just start to get into the
groove of the natural rhythms

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:23.460 align:middle line:90%
of nature, if it's possible.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.290 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: How much sleep is
enough sleep for weight loss,

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and for maintaining a healthy,
balanced body, for real?

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, whoever "they"
are, but they do say

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:34.520 align:middle line:90%
between six and eight hours.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I love eight hours,
but I actually

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.450 align:middle line:90%
do quite well on six hours.

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But I think to really
respect sleep-- this concept

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.480 align:middle line:90%
is not related to weight loss.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But I really think to really
understand that sleep is

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.630 align:middle line:84%
an incredible
gift, and to really

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:55.050 align:middle line:84%
respect it, and really
utilize that sleep

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:56.540 align:middle line:90%
state for healing and repair.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And so many people don't
respect getting into bed.

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And they, oh, I'll just
stay up until midnight,

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.250 align:middle line:84%
or I'll maybe push it
to 1:00 in the morning.

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And they don't realize that
there's an incredible energy

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.600 align:middle line:84%
that literally sweeps the
earth and takes the person

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.030 align:middle line:90%
when they're asleep, literally.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And we know this from ancient
text to the halls of learning,

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.820 align:middle line:84%
where they're educated
for their higher purpose.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that sleep state
is tremendously important.

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.970 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, it's a
beautiful way of saying that.

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:90%
That makes a lot of sense.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Exercise-- is exercise
something that can

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:28.830 align:middle line:90%
really help hormonal balancing?

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.020 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND:
Very much so.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's so wonderful.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Exercise is wonderful.

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.130 align:middle line:90%
It's so exciting.

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I love a nice walk
early in the morning,

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and watch the seasons change,
and see what people are doing

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:41.280 align:middle line:84%
in the neighborhood,
and just observe

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.950 align:middle line:84%
little flowers, and trees,
and trees coming in to bud,

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:44.850 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So just a daily walk,
15-minute brisk walk.

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:48.794 align:middle line:84%
People can get that
pretty much anywhere.

00:54:48.794 --> 00:54:49.660 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Do you do that?

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of
your daily routine?

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I do some form of
exercising every day.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.230 align:middle line:90%
I love to swim in the summer.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I love to swim in the ocean,
or in the lake, or in the pool.

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So I love to swim,
and I love to walk.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Skiing, cross-country skiing
in the winter, I'll do that.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm pretty much into
exercising moderately.

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's any need
for any excessive exercise,

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:09.360 align:middle line:84%
because you can really
hurt yourself with that.

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.590 align:middle line:84%
But exercise is important,
moves the lymphatic system,

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and oxygenates your
brain, which, of course,

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.880 align:middle line:90%
is great for thinking.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.030 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Well, you have
an amazing perspective

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.980 align:middle line:90%
on so many things.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And this entire show has
been filled with solutions.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have a video
here that Carolyn

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Sutherland has put together
called "Your Body Knows."

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And it shows a little
bit about her work

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:33.860 align:middle line:84%
as a medical intuitive,
and how to really

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.393 align:middle line:84%
ask your body what it needs to
have a healthy, vibrant life.

00:55:37.393 --> 00:55:38.093 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:55:38.093 --> 00:55:41.604 align:middle line:90%


00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:43.751 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:55:43.751 --> 00:55:44.817 align:middle line:90%
NARRATOR: Think about your body.

00:55:44.817 --> 00:55:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Are you happy with how you look?

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:54.631 align:middle line:90%


00:55:54.631 --> 00:55:55.330 align:middle line:90%
How you feel?

00:55:55.330 --> 00:56:00.310 align:middle line:90%


00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:02.440 align:middle line:84%
CAROLINE SUTHERLAND: The
attainment of physical health,

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and vitality, and stamina,
and vibrancy is not a mystery.

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:11.140 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: The people you are
about to see are not actors.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.170 align:middle line:90%
These are their true stories.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:17.600 align:middle line:90%
My body was just sluggish.

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.860 align:middle line:90%
My hands hurt, my feet hurt.

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Tremendous physical fatigue,
as well as my mental clarity

00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.050 align:middle line:90%
was kind of shot.

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:29.560 align:middle line:84%
The fat between my legs would
rub and then I'd get blisters.

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.540 align:middle line:84%
I was in a desperate
physical state.

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I really needed some help.

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:35.968 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: What happens when
your child's health suffers?

00:56:35.968 --> 00:56:41.460 align:middle line:90%


00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.110 align:middle line:84%
One morning, my wife called
me hysterical from home.

00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said the sheets
are soaked in blood.

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:49.700 align:middle line:84%
The pediatrician immediately
wrote down on the chart

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.130 align:middle line:90%
"chronic failure to thrive."

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:53.580 align:middle line:84%
The diagnosis the
doctors gave us

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.480 align:middle line:84%
was agonizing,
that this was going

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:56.986 align:middle line:90%
to be a life-long condition.

00:56:56.986 --> 00:57:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And to tell us
there was no hope.

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.061 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: It's all
because of one woman.

00:57:02.061 --> 00:57:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Caroline.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:10.460 align:middle line:90%


00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.930 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Internationally
recognized

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:14.880 align:middle line:84%
author and well-respected
medical intuitive

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Caroline Sutherland.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.630 align:middle line:84%
A knowingness, a knowingness--
I didn't know why I had that

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:23.160 align:middle line:90%
knowing, but I knew I had it.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.890 align:middle line:84%
When you first
come up to Caroline,

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:26.670 align:middle line:84%
it's really kind of
interesting, because you

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:28.340 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to experience.

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.480 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like she walks into your
body, and then walks back out.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:35.920 align:middle line:84%
She didn't examine my son,
she just looked at him.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.176 align:middle line:84%
And she gave this
no-nonsense advice

00:57:39.176 --> 00:57:40.930 align:middle line:90%
how we could help heal him.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.440 align:middle line:90%
It was always practical.

00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.290 align:middle line:84%
It was never something
mysterious and esoteric.

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I always knew that
there was a foundation,

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.190 align:middle line:84%
a practical foundation, forward
the intuitive impressions.

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Once we started,
it was so easy.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.650 align:middle line:90%
It was nothing to it.

00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just very normal
and natural for me.

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:03.311 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing fancy, or
glowing, in glowing lights

00:58:03.311 --> 00:58:04.010 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:06.754 align:middle line:84%
It's just normal, it's
just how it comes to me.

00:58:06.754 --> 00:58:08.620 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Look at how their
lives have been transformed.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:17.229 align:middle line:90%


00:58:17.229 --> 00:58:21.830 align:middle line:84%
In four and a half months,
I've lost 30 plus pounds.

00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching myself
just melt away.

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:27.760 align:middle line:90%


00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.976 align:middle line:84%
Becoming the new
me, the real me.

00:58:29.976 --> 00:58:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It has changed my life.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:33.570 align:middle line:90%
I owe her my life.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I am thrilled to
feel so much better

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.210 align:middle line:84%
physically, mentally,
emotionally,

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:40.214 align:middle line:90%
and therefore, spiritually.

00:58:40.214 --> 00:58:42.910 align:middle line:84%
In one week there was
something in my son's eyes,

00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:45.190 align:middle line:84%
something in his reaction.
And I saw it.

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, there's a sparkle.

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:51.590 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have that
dullness anymore.

00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And one week later, I knew.

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:57.540 align:middle line:84%
She also told us that in one
month, it'll all be a memory.

00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.302 align:middle line:84%
And then four weeks later,
it was just a memory.

00:59:00.302 --> 00:59:02.852 align:middle line:90%


00:59:02.852 --> 00:59:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I can see
it in their body,

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.110 align:middle line:84%
that their body has the
health, it has the vitality,

00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:11.430 align:middle line:84%
it has the capability of
being able to make the switch,

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:16.350 align:middle line:84%
if they will do it, and if
they have the practical tools.

00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:18.420 align:middle line:84%
The attainment of
physical health,

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and vitality, and stamina, and
vibrancy, is not a mystery.

00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:28.700 align:middle line:84%
That's there for
every single person.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really amazing,
the type of person

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:34.200 align:middle line:84%
that you are where you consider
this a privilege to help

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.340 align:middle line:90%
people with their health.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a gift to
be able to sit with you,

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:40.941 align:middle line:84%
and to have you impart your
beautiful information on all

00:59:40.941 --> 00:59:41.640 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.365 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate you
being here, Caroline.

00:59:43.365 --> 00:59:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:45.215 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.
