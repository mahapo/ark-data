>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:22.957 align:middle line:84%
Students today, of all
ages, are facing more stress

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
than they ever have before,
with heavier academic schedules,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.564 align:middle line:84%
lengthy state testing, and
increased social pressures.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:34.135 align:middle line:84%
So, what exactly is being
done to support today's youth,

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:36.937 align:middle line:84%
and where are they
learning the skills to cope

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:39.206 align:middle line:90%
with modern-day pressures?

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.341 align:middle line:90%
My guest today, BD,

00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:44.512 align:middle line:84%
asked herself the same
question 32 years ago.

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:46.447 align:middle line:84%
And today she has
changed the lives

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:50.184 align:middle line:84%
of over 10 million students
through her SuperCamp

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:52.553 align:middle line:84%
and Quantum Learning
school programs.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:53.454 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:54.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Bobbi Deporter: Thank you.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:55.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: Gosh,
thank you [laughter].

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Bobbi Deporter: Yeah,
it's fun to be here with you.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:58.959 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It's great to
be here, but you have done

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:84%
such an amazing amount of work,
and you've made such a dent

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.432 align:middle line:84%
in the -- in the --
in our youth today,

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.034 align:middle line:90%
really, in making an impact.

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.569 align:middle line:84%
It's such a beautiful
thing that you've done,

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.371 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
dive into this.

00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:12.606 align:middle line:84%
But, it wasn't always
like that for you, right?

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:16.043 align:middle line:84%
You had -- you started off in
a totally different sector.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:90%
A different...

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.012 align:middle line:90%
>> Bobbi Deporter: I did.

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:19.213 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to think
back, because I think back

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:22.383 align:middle line:84%
to those first moments and
then envision, you know,

00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:24.852 align:middle line:84%
where we are today and
the impact starting

00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:90%
from one program.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.955 align:middle line:84%
It really started
for me, myself --

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:31.559 align:middle line:84%
I was married with two young
children, and then when they got

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:84%
into school, wanting to
do something for myself,

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.364 align:middle line:84%
so I ended up joining a new
company in San Francisco

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.166 align:middle line:84%
that was real estate
and investments.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.436 align:middle line:84%
But what caught my eye
on it, was just the --

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.738 align:middle line:84%
the vision, or the
purpose of the company.

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:48.474 align:middle line:84%
What they talked about was the
importance of relationship,

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:51.312 align:middle line:84%
and basically started
using the term win-win,

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:55.549 align:middle line:84%
before it was popular, and
that, you know, it was the 70s

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.885 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco, and it was the
heyday, really, for real estate.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.788 align:middle line:90%
So, it was transformation.

00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:03.991 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was in a 24-hour
transformational workshop

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.792 align:middle line:90%
working there.

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:05.826 align:middle line:90%
People wanted to stay there.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
We're held accountable
for our results.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.496 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:10.664 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: If we don't get
results, if people said no to us

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.233 align:middle line:90%
on the phone, they sent us home.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:14.702 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to do about the
people; it was always, you know,

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:90%
where are we coming from?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.071 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow, interesting.

00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:18.439 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: I know.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.009 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, with the goals
and supportive relationship,

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.646 align:middle line:84%
I always remember that as that,
you know, the mailman would come

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.815 align:middle line:84%
in to deliver mail
and would sit down.

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:31.418 align:middle line:84%
It just felt good, you know,
that there was passion,

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.855 align:middle line:84%
excitement, engagement,
everybody supporting everyone.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:37.658 align:middle line:84%
So, here I was -- when I
interviewed for the job,

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:41.528 align:middle line:84%
and this is really interesting,
is because one of the --

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:44.031 align:middle line:84%
there was three male partners
that started this company,

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:47.501 align:middle line:84%
and one of them interviewed
me and then brought me back

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:48.869 align:middle line:84%
to interview with
the other three,

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.739 align:middle line:84%
and I always remember this,
is one of the partners looked

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.841 align:middle line:84%
at the other and said,
"Why did you bring

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:56.076 align:middle line:84%
in a housewife with
no experience?"

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:56.776 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: In front of you?

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:57.344 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: In front of me.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.178 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, wow.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.613 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: As I'm sitting there --

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:02.149 align:middle line:84%
you know, one of the things I
learned is, I was really set

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.886 align:middle line:84%
on the goal that I had, and
just let those comments go

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:07.454 align:middle line:84%
through me, because
that wasn't me.

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:08.522 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't who I am.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:09.189 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: My goodness.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.057 align:middle line:90%
So, it didn't stick.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:11.458 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: No, it didn't.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:14.361 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things they
told me was you have to make

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.298 align:middle line:84%
at least $30,000 a year in
commission, or you're not here.

00:03:17.298 --> 00:03:20.199 align:middle line:84%
In kind of an intimidate
-- intimidating way.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.103 align:middle line:84%
And so I went in on Labor
Day to start making calls

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.406 align:middle line:84%
because no one else was
there in the office,

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:27.274 align:middle line:84%
and I was feeling a
little self-conscience.

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:30.277 align:middle line:84%
But, I happen to make a call
and connect with somebody,

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:34.214 align:middle line:84%
and it turned in to a real
estate deal that made me $30,000

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.017 align:middle line:84%
on my first day, so I thought
well, this is over with now.

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:39.186 align:middle line:84%
You know, now I can
just play and wait.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:40.387 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.855 align:middle line:84%
Have you always been that
type of goal-oriented,

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.824 align:middle line:90%
or wanting a little bit more,

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:45.959 align:middle line:84%
or challenge yourself
type of person?

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.697 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: When I know what I want,
I just keep my focus on that,

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:52.599 align:middle line:84%
and when anything comes up
it's just what do I need to do

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.802 align:middle line:90%
about it to keep going.

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:56.403 align:middle line:90%
You know, this was --

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:59.239 align:middle line:84%
this company was written up for
the results we were getting,

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.607 align:middle line:84%
so I left with one
of the partners

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and we started a business
school for entrepreneurs,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.846 align:middle line:84%
which was then called the
Burklyn Business School,

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.915 align:middle line:84%
and it was to teach the
things we were doing.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.684 align:middle line:84%
You know, they weren't coming
to learn how to sell real estate

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:13.687 align:middle line:84%
or investments, it was
really about the --

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:17.925 align:middle line:84%
how we're running a company
that was that engaging,

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.327 align:middle line:84%
had gotten the results
that we did.

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:21.528 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Real estate can be

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:24.131 align:middle line:84%
such a personal business,
if you're good at it.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.333 align:middle line:84%
It's really about the
relationships that you develop

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:29.269 align:middle line:84%
with the people that you are --
are your clients, and so forth.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.671 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Absolutely.

00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:34.908 align:middle line:84%
You know, that one of the -- we
did a condominium conversion,

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:40.247 align:middle line:84%
and I always remember it was 282
units, and there were 500 people

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.383 align:middle line:84%
that lived there, and
most of them were seniors.

00:04:42.383 --> 00:04:44.952 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, we just
turned the community you get --

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:47.354 align:middle line:84%
when you get -- when you
know everything you do is

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.857 align:middle line:84%
about people, and you're
changing people's lives,

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:54.762 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you're doing, it
was -- it was an exciting time.

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:57.064 align:middle line:84%
I loved what we were doing
and it was very exciting.

00:04:57.064 --> 00:05:00.134 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And seeing you and
knowing you a little bit,

00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:02.936 align:middle line:84%
I see that you love
transformation.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.739 align:middle line:84%
That you really do
love -- it's rewarding.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.308 align:middle line:90%
It's satisfying.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.912 align:middle line:84%
It's fulfilling to see
a person, or a thing,

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:15.015 align:middle line:90%
or a system transform.

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Does that move you?

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.584 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: It absolutely does.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all,
the shift in my own life

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.189 align:middle line:90%
when different learnings came,

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.659 align:middle line:84%
but then the people we work
with, and then our clients,

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.395 align:middle line:84%
and then my own children
and my family.

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:31.899 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're making
-- just, we were --

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:34.468 align:middle line:84%
we were making change
in people's lives.

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:35.869 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:37.471 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: The work we were doing
with the business school and...

00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:38.705 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So, the business school.

00:05:38.705 --> 00:05:41.909 align:middle line:84%
You went out and you sought
a whole new environment

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.312 align:middle line:84%
of teaching people how
to run businesses, right?

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:49.216 align:middle line:84%
And then how did that develop
into the Quantum Learning,

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:51.218 align:middle line:84%
or the SuperCamps, you
started off with, right?

00:05:51.218 --> 00:05:52.319 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Right.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.687 align:middle line:84%
Well, we got interested
in how people learn,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.356 align:middle line:84%
and I got connected
with a man by the name

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:84%
of Dr. Georgi Lozanov, and
this is in the late 70s,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.429 align:middle line:84%
and he's from Bulgaria, and
considered the originator

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.499 align:middle line:84%
of what's called accelerate --
accelerated learning method.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.069 align:middle line:84%
So, we got him about of
Bulgaria and he was in my home

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.205 align:middle line:84%
for three weeks, and
that was not easy.

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's all kinds
of intrigue that went.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.477 align:middle line:84%
He came with a bodyguard, and
it was not for his safety,

00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:18.846 align:middle line:84%
it was so that he wouldn't
escape or, you know,

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:20.481 align:middle line:84%
that he would come
back to the country.

00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:21.715 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, my goodness.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: They kept his family,
they kept his research,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and they tattooed him as a
flight risk, you know, so,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.724 align:middle line:84%
and I think back to that time,
because everything I'm doing,

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:34.161 align:middle line:84%
I go back to what I was learning
from him over those three weeks,

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:37.831 align:middle line:84%
because it was about engaged
learning, interaction,

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.565 align:middle line:90%
you know, role playing.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:84%
We were learning Italian
and, because it's --

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.073 align:middle line:84%
he did that so he could teach
us the methods of learning,

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:48.541 align:middle line:84%
and none of knew Italian,
and it's very easy

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle line:84%
to measure what you're
learning, so we had,

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.846 align:middle line:90%
you know, Italian names.

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:54.748 align:middle line:84%
We came up with Italian
personalities.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.985 align:middle line:84%
We just got totally
immersed, and that's --

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:00.454 align:middle line:90%
I am a very low auditory.

00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:02.422 align:middle line:84%
Foreign language was very
hard for me in school,

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.392 align:middle line:84%
and I kind of thought oh great,
what have I gotten myself into?

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:07.494 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was a little
nervous about that,

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
but on the second day,
he was speaking Italian

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and asked a question,
and he's very playful,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.269 align:middle line:84%
and he had a big beach ball,
and he asked me a question

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:18.005 align:middle line:84%
and threw the ball and
the answer came out.

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:20.841 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought about,
where did that come from?

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:23.577 align:middle line:84%
But, just seeing how the
methods work, which is a lot

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:27.114 align:middle line:84%
about relax, focus,
concentration and, you know,

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:30.884 align:middle line:84%
we applied then those to the --
methods to the business school

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:33.854 align:middle line:84%
and found the adults were having
so much fun learning and a lot

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:36.256 align:middle line:84%
of them didn't remember
learning that way.

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:39.359 align:middle line:84%
And then we also taught them
how to be successful learners,

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:84%
so we taught them reading, and
mind-mapping, and memory skills,

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.533 align:middle line:84%
and then with these engaging
methods we learned a lot.

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:48.235 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, so when the
ball got thrown to you,

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.437 align:middle line:84%
you learned that you were a
kinesthetic learner, that --

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.439 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
learn about this.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:55.075 align:middle line:84%
That there's auditory,
kinesthetic and...

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:55.576 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Visual.

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.945 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: ...visual
learners, and so,

00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:00.914 align:middle line:84%
each learner has a
different style innately...

00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:01.882 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Right.

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: ...and so
you got to discover

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.051 align:middle line:84%
that through what he
brought out in you,

00:08:04.051 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
so I call this experiential
learning,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.487 align:middle line:90%
but what do you call it?

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.655 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well, experiential
learning is...

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:09.156 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: It is?

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:09.856 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.258 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: ...innate too.

00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:14.461 align:middle line:84%
It's about really diving in and
having experiences to draw from,

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:18.465 align:middle line:84%
because it gives us a common
experience, or common schema

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:22.803 align:middle line:84%
that we can draw on to then
build new associations.

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:25.339 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I think if we had
more of this in our schools,

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:26.673 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't have
some of the problems.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.409 align:middle line:84%
I pulled some of these
statistics off of the internet.

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:32.846 align:middle line:84%
3 million high school
students drop out annually.

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:37.217 align:middle line:84%
That means, 8,300 high school
students drop out a day,

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:41.121 align:middle line:84%
so today, as you're watching
this, 8,300 kids are dropping

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:46.193 align:middle line:84%
out of school, and 75% of
U.S. crimes are committed

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:48.495 align:middle line:90%
by a high school dropout,

00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:52.866 align:middle line:84%
and 90% of U.S. jobs
are not eligible

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.201 align:middle line:90%
for high school dropouts.

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.404 align:middle line:84%
So, if you drop out of school,
there's only a 10% chance

00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:59.373 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to get a job anyway,

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:02.809 align:middle line:90%
so I think our school system

00:09:02.809 --> 00:09:06.346 align:middle line:84%
and our learning system
needs a drastic shift.

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:09.449 align:middle line:84%
How did it get to this place in
the first place, though Bobbi?

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:90%
What is your opinion?

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.589 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well, we saw this need
and that's why we took action,

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:18.859 align:middle line:84%
but it got there,
you know, so many --

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:21.695 align:middle line:84%
in many classrooms
kids are bored.

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:24.064 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're not
engaged, they're bored.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.034 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'll never forget --
I think it was 25 years ago,

00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo DiCaprio, there
was a big article on him.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.239 align:middle line:84%
He was in high school
then, and it was --

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.775 align:middle line:84%
he had this big quote about
school was so dull and boring,

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:37.177 align:middle line:84%
he actually had dropped out at
the time, and I assume he went

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.379 align:middle line:84%
on and did other things,
but at that point,

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:40.847 align:middle line:90%
it really hit me back then.

00:09:40.847 --> 00:09:41.682 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:09:41.682 --> 00:09:42.816 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: And -- being that well --

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:44.918 align:middle line:84%
and not as well-known
back then, but just...

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:46.253 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: He was a voice.

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:47.854 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: He was a voice, and
to say that school is so dull

00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:49.189 align:middle line:84%
and boring, we have
to do something.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:52.092 align:middle line:84%
And that really was where
it is, and knowing that,

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:55.862 align:middle line:84%
people learn differently,
and that if I had known

00:09:55.862 --> 00:09:59.599 align:middle line:84%
that as a child, or a student
in school, because I could look

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.869 align:middle line:84%
to the student next to me who
is excelling in something and...

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.371 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: ...

00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:05.338 align:middle line:84%
it's like why am I
not getting that?

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.373 align:middle line:84%
In foreign language,
it's like why --

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.341 align:middle line:90%
why is that such a struggle?

00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:08.408 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not getting it?

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:10.377 align:middle line:84%
I just needed to be
taught differently.

00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:12.112 align:middle line:90%
I need different strategies.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.315 align:middle line:84%
So when kids start feeling
like they're not being --

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:19.152 align:middle line:84%
not successful, not being able
to keep up with the other kids,

00:10:19.152 --> 00:10:21.021 align:middle line:84%
they start thinking
they're the problem.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:22.255 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Hmm-mm.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:22.956 align:middle line:84%
Something's wrong with
them, and then you get a lot

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.224 align:middle line:90%
of labels put on them.

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:26.159 align:middle line:84%
So, how would one know
if they're an auditory,

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:28.195 align:middle line:90%
visual, or kinesthetic lead?

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:30.297 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well, one is just
observations, and its strength.

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:32.999 align:middle line:84%
We all have all three,
though it's what the strength

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:36.903 align:middle line:84%
and preference is, and
observation is a great way.

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:40.407 align:middle line:84%
But when you -- if somebody
-- if you need directions,

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:42.375 align:middle line:84%
you know, do you
want to see a map.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.143 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Okay.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.244 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: I'm highly visual.

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:45.812 align:middle line:84%
Very low auditory,
highly visual.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:46.813 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:48.215 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: If somebody
tries to tell me,

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.983 align:middle line:84%
it's just [background talking]
like I am smiling and looking

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:52.352 align:middle line:84%
at them, and it's like, I'm
just waiting for them to finish.

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:53.553 align:middle line:84%
Because when they're
done [laughter],

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:55.055 align:middle line:90%
it's like, okay, can you draw...

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:55.756 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Show me.

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:56.289 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: ...this for me?

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:57.224 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yep.

00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:59.059 align:middle line:84%
So, you would know
that, or if --

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.395 align:middle line:84%
so that's auditory,
visual, or tactile.

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.396 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yeah, tactile.

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:05.599 align:middle line:84%
You only want to
handle things and move.

00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:07.801 align:middle line:84%
I'm visual and kinesthetic
tactile.

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:09.836 align:middle line:84%
And then the auditory
repeats back,

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.139 align:middle line:84%
it's like they have
a tape in their head.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:15.108 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that's said,
and then they want to repeat it.

00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:16.309 align:middle line:90%
They're really repeating it

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:18.612 align:middle line:84%
so they'll hear it
again themselves.

00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:21.548 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, do you separate
kids in terms of their leads

00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:24.718 align:middle line:84%
in the particular room, or
is it just taught all --

00:11:24.718 --> 00:11:26.987 align:middle line:84%
to all three of those types
of [background talking].

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:28.655 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: You know, we
focus on the teacher,

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:31.758 align:middle line:84%
that the teacher is
doing visual, auditory,

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:34.494 align:middle line:90%
kinesthetic types of strategies.

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:38.098 align:middle line:84%
One is for visual, that
the teacher's stand

00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:39.699 align:middle line:90%
by what they're writing.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.203 align:middle line:84%
It drives a visual crazy to
have the material looking

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:43.837 align:middle line:90%
over here...

00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:45.205 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: One place.

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.606 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...and the teacher over
here, and you're going back

00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:49.176 align:middle line:84%
and forth and you need to put
it together so you can see it.

00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:52.212 align:middle line:84%
You know, and certainly the
taking breaks and movement.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:56.516 align:middle line:84%
We teach that you must make
body motions with a lot

00:11:56.516 --> 00:11:58.051 align:middle line:84%
of the things you're
trying to learn.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.087 align:middle line:84%
It just -- it's association
and helps you remember.

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:02.422 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wonderful.

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:05.091 align:middle line:84%
So, now from the business
school you started SuperCamps.

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.293 align:middle line:90%
How did that come about?

00:12:06.293 --> 00:12:07.627 align:middle line:90%
Tell us that story.

00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:08.762 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, we were
doing all this good work

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
with the business school,
and we had somebody that came

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.738 align:middle line:84%
to teach there that had a way of
making money in stock options.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:23.743 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was interesting
that my partner and I were,

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.712 align:middle line:90%
you know, following it.

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:27.747 align:middle line:84%
It was like, wow, this is
really quite something,

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:28.715 align:middle line:90%
and then we started putting

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:31.184 align:middle line:84%
in our own money
and making a return.

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:34.221 align:middle line:84%
And this was a huge learning
for me, so much came out of it

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
in my life that I don't
think I'd be doing what I did

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.959 align:middle line:84%
if I hadn't experienced
what we were doing,

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:42.796 align:middle line:84%
because we then got investors
and people wanted to invest,

00:12:42.796 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and we were thinking about
it as making all this money

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.636 align:middle line:84%
that we would make to then
support the good work we're

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:50.503 align:middle line:90%
doing over here.

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:52.372 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't our passion.

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's people
that are very interested

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.442 align:middle line:84%
and passionate of
that, we weren't.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:59.145 align:middle line:84%
Had no business being it, and we
actually grew what we were doing

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:02.249 align:middle line:84%
in the system so large that it
crashed and I lost everything.

00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:06.987 align:middle line:84%
So, here on one hand, I had
made millions in real estate

00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:09.256 align:middle line:90%
and then having to lose --

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.591 align:middle line:84%
I lost it over about
a three week period.

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:12.893 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness.

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:15.529 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: All my properties,
my home, everything crashed.

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:16.296 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:17.063 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: I lost possessions.

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:18.231 align:middle line:90%
It was...

00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:19.599 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Shocking.

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.801 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: It was shocking, and,
you know, I was standing there

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.371 align:middle line:84%
and I can remember things
just being taken away --

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:28.275 align:middle line:84%
taken away, or sold
off and you get numb.

00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:31.611 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt my
self-worth at that time --

00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:34.814 align:middle line:84%
it felt like I had made
such a mistake and made --

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.752 align:middle line:84%
it was so bad for other
people that I didn't feel

00:13:38.752 --> 00:13:42.956 align:middle line:84%
like I deserved anything,
you know, for myself.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:45.725 align:middle line:84%
It was just like take it away,
I don't deserve any better,

00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:48.762 align:middle line:84%
and so I went and
stayed with a friend

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:51.932 align:middle line:84%
who had an apartment
downstairs in the basement.

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:55.302 align:middle line:84%
It was at the top of Topanga
Canyon, actually, and it was --

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:58.905 align:middle line:84%
just went up there for three
months, and just healed myself,

00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:01.908 align:middle line:84%
and be quite with
myself, and heal myself.

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:05.278 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, that was one of
my biggest, biggest learnings is

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that when people are
taking possessions,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.951 align:middle line:84%
and things were going away,
and even some friends left,

00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
is I found that nobody
could take away who I was.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:19.259 align:middle line:84%
No one could take away my
dreams, my values, who I am,

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:22.595 align:middle line:84%
and intellectually I've
learned that, but to get it

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
at such a core level, it
really shifted my life.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:32.305 align:middle line:84%
You know, I feel more secure in
myself and I'm fear-risk-less,

00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:35.608 align:middle line:84%
because I know no one can
take that away from me

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:39.079 align:middle line:84%
and when I have that, I can
recreate and do in the future.

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:42.215 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Where were you're -- you
had children at the time, right?

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:90%
How old were they at that time?

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.553 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: They were around 10
and 12, and actually I ended

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.321 align:middle line:84%
up getting a divorce,
and my children went

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:50.924 align:middle line:90%
to live with my husband, so.

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:53.059 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That was [background
talking] a tough time.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Yeah, it's my crash year
of just going through so much.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.498 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Most people that --

00:14:58.498 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't bounce back
from something like that,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and so how did you turn
it around and start one

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.172 align:middle line:84%
of the most successful
programs in the U.S.?

00:15:06.172 --> 00:15:06.973 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yeah.

00:15:06.973 --> 00:15:08.041 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: How did you do that?

00:15:08.041 --> 00:15:09.042 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well, the
business school continued.

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:11.544 align:middle line:84%
We brought in additional
partners and,

00:15:11.544 --> 00:15:14.781 align:middle line:84%
because they kept saying we got
so much value, it just has to,

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.051 align:middle line:84%
so it's kind of like they drove,
you know, dragged my partner

00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:21.087 align:middle line:84%
and myself with them,
because I felt like, you know,

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:22.589 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have anything
at that time.

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.058 align:middle line:84%
But we started with one
of the business programs,

00:15:25.058 --> 00:15:27.694 align:middle line:84%
but the adults then were
saying this is so good,

00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:30.363 align:middle line:84%
we have to do something
for our children.

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:34.167 align:middle line:84%
So, I partnered up with two
other people and, you know,

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:36.503 align:middle line:84%
the one thing they didn't
take away from me was my car.

00:15:36.503 --> 00:15:39.839 align:middle line:84%
I had a car, so I got a bank
to give me a loan on my car,

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:42.342 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I started
our youth program.

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:43.176 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness.

00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:44.811 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: So, yeah 32 years ago.

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.179 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: And I'm still friends
with the banker, so [laughter].

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, it was about
bringing these techniques

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.318 align:middle line:90%
that you learned from Dr....

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Lozanov.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.122 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: ...Lozanov, and bring
them into the learning --

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.657 align:middle line:84%
experiential learning
environment

00:15:57.657 --> 00:15:59.359 align:middle line:90%
through a camp program.

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:01.327 align:middle line:84%
But it was more of a
motivational camp, right?

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: It is an academic,
you know, summer experience,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.833 align:middle line:84%
and my children were
teenagers at the time,

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:08.935 align:middle line:84%
and so they came to
the first program.

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:12.005 align:middle line:84%
And I know my son had spent
time with me with the adults

00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:14.407 align:middle line:84%
at the business school,
and he said, you know,

00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:16.042 align:middle line:84%
"this isn't going to
work mom," you know.

00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:18.678 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, "this really
better be good," you know,

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:21.948 align:middle line:84%
he didn't want to be embarrassed
coming to the first program.

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:24.984 align:middle line:84%
But, we took the learning
skills and the learning methods

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:28.455 align:middle line:84%
and taught youth how to
learn, and it goes back

00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:29.823 align:middle line:90%
to the problems in schools.

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:31.891 align:middle line:90%
We were, you know, seeing a need

00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:34.527 align:middle line:84%
that students were not
taught how to learn.

00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It's assumed that,
okay they go to school,

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.731 align:middle line:84%
they're supposed to
know how to study.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.834 align:middle line:84%
They're told to go write a
paper, go study for a test.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.403 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Go back and
memorize whatever?

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:44.771 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:47.907 align:middle line:84%
And how specifically take notes,
how specifically, you know,

00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:49.442 align:middle line:84%
and how to prepare for
the test, you know,

00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:54.981 align:middle line:84%
so when they do prepare, they
-- and are taught specifically.

00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:57.684 align:middle line:84%
Most students say,
why didn't you --

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.519 align:middle line:84%
why did nobody tell
this to me before?

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.553 align:middle line:90%
It makes such a difference.

00:17:00.553 --> 00:17:02.155 align:middle line:84%
And then we get into
the life skills,

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:05.158 align:middle line:84%
and so it's transformational
experience for youth.

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:06.592 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I'm sure you've
heard all of it.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:10.163 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the video
here of what SuperCamps are,

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:12.799 align:middle line:84%
and you can get an essence
for everything that's taught.

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.768 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:23.842 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:26.513 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music] On the
first day, I totally got there

00:17:26.513 --> 00:17:27.714 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think it
was going to be too cool,

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.015 align:middle line:84%
but then I felt like,
even they're totally cool

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and then I got in there and
we came in this band room

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.717 align:middle line:84%
and there's all these
colors and this music.

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:31.784 align:middle line:90%
I was like aaah!

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:32.986 align:middle line:84%
I'm like what the
heck is going on here.

00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:33.987 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if I
wanted to be here, right?

00:17:33.987 --> 00:17:34.788 align:middle line:84%
>> What do we do
with this [cheering]?

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.191 align:middle line:90%
>> We're kind of like,

00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:39.759 align:middle line:84%
well these people are
crazy [background noise].

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:45.131 align:middle line:84%
>> We came in the next morning
to learn about this [inaudible],

00:17:45.131 --> 00:17:45.965 align:middle line:84%
then we learned about
the comfort zone,

00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:90%
that we call a [inaudible].

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.368 align:middle line:84%
Then we did some academic
stuff, like this is going to be

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:49.135 align:middle line:84%
like school, but it
wasn't like school,

00:17:49.135 --> 00:17:49.836 align:middle line:90%
it was totally different.

00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:50.937 align:middle line:90%
It was totally awesome.

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:53.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, this is so much
better than school.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.942 align:middle line:84%
>> You can connect fun with
learning [background noise].

00:17:58.711 --> 00:17:59.746 align:middle line:84%
>> We're basically
being prepared

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:00.947 align:middle line:90%
for the real world out there.

00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:02.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Who knew I was smart
in eight different ways?

00:18:02.148 --> 00:18:03.516 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know I was
smart in one [laughter].

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:05.418 align:middle line:84%
>> You will meet
people on the first day,

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and you get to know your
team really quickly,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.556 align:middle line:84%
and they soon become
your family, you know.

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:10.924 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we came in here
and we looked [inaudible],

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.125 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like I ain't falling
on nobody, and then I climbed

00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:13.159 align:middle line:84%
up a tree 18 feet, fell
down totally off the pole.

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:90%
It's safe.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:14.828 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to talk to
you right now, right?

00:18:14.828 --> 00:18:16.362 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel good!

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:17.497 align:middle line:84%
>> Came in here and we
just danced a party.

00:18:17.497 --> 00:18:18.565 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know I had
moves, but I got moves.

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:19.866 align:middle line:84%
I'll totally show
you my moves, right.

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.234 align:middle line:84%
Then we came in here and we
learned reading, writing,

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:22.368 align:middle line:84%
science, and my brain was like
mwah, I can't take anymore!

00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:23.169 align:middle line:90%
And they were like yes you can.

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:23.837 align:middle line:90%
I totally get it.

00:18:23.837 --> 00:18:24.671 align:middle line:90%
I took it all in.

00:18:24.671 --> 00:18:25.505 align:middle line:90%
I have a totally awesome brain.

00:18:25.505 --> 00:18:26.039 align:middle line:90%
>> You're going to believe it!

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Do it!

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.808 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought it couldn't get any
better, and then came in here.

00:18:28.808 --> 00:18:30.009 align:middle line:84%
They gave me this board, and
they're like you're going to go

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:31.377 align:middle line:84%
through that bored, and
I'm like it ain't a board,

00:18:31.377 --> 00:18:32.478 align:middle line:84%
it's a barrier, and I'm like
yeah, yeah, now breathe, one,

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:33.847 align:middle line:84%
two, three and I
was like aaah, boom!

00:18:33.847 --> 00:18:35.248 align:middle line:84%
Then we came in here last night,
took a stab at my greatness.

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:36.382 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, yeah I'm totally
great -- I'm totally great!

00:18:36.382 --> 00:18:38.551 align:middle line:90%
>> You are all created geniuses.

00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:39.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Then I came here,
went to graduation.

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:41.554 align:middle line:84%

stood up and I almost saw a daze

00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:46.779 align:middle line:84%
on his face, and I thought
he will never be the same --

00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:48.547 align:middle line:90%
he will never be the same.

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It was just this transformation

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
that was happening before my
eyes and I went, that, you know,

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.688 align:middle line:90%
that's what I want to do.

00:25:55.688 --> 00:25:58.424 align:middle line:84%
That's -- I made the commitment,
and this is 32 years later,

00:25:58.424 --> 00:26:01.761 align:middle line:84%
and we had 65,000
graduates of SuperCamp, now.

00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:03.529 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Did you run
into that boy recently?

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:04.063 align:middle line:90%
I think I...

00:26:04.063 --> 00:26:05.197 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:05.765 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: ...remember you
saying you did, right?

00:26:05.765 --> 00:26:06.699 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: I did.

00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:08.067 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had our
25th anniversary.

00:26:08.067 --> 00:26:10.703 align:middle line:84%
We had a big celebration,
and I Googled him

00:26:10.703 --> 00:26:15.474 align:middle line:84%
and actually found him, and got
a hold of him and I told him.

00:26:15.474 --> 00:26:16.809 align:middle line:90%
I said, you're the one.

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:19.512 align:middle line:84%
You're the one of why we're
making the difference we are

00:26:19.512 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.883 align:middle line:84%
And so, he came to
our celebration,

00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:26.252 align:middle line:84%
and I got to have him stand
up and acknowledge him

00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:28.654 align:middle line:84%
from the front of the room,
as well as, personally later.

00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:29.221 align:middle line:90%
But...

00:26:29.221 --> 00:26:29.789 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Goodness.

00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:31.023 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: I know.

00:26:31.023 --> 00:26:32.725 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, now -- then these
programs you said, okay,

00:26:32.725 --> 00:26:34.393 align:middle line:84%
camp's not enough,
you want to take this

00:26:34.393 --> 00:26:35.594 align:middle line:90%
into the school system, right?

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:36.429 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:37.496 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And now, first of all,

00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:38.964 align:middle line:84%
the SuperCamps are
in nine universities?

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:40.232 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:42.968 align:middle line:84%
We're at Stanford, UC Berkley,
UCLA, Loyola Marymount,

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:45.671 align:middle line:84%
but we're at Brown
University, Wake University,

00:26:45.671 --> 00:26:48.674 align:middle line:84%
University of Texas, so we have
nine sights around the U.S.,

00:26:48.674 --> 00:26:51.811 align:middle line:84%
and are also in 14
countries, so it spread.

00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:52.712 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness.

00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:53.979 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:55.915 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And so then, you
decided to take this program,

00:26:55.915 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
this type of experiential
learning, this Quantum Learning,

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.086 align:middle line:84%
you call it, into the
school system, right?

00:27:00.086 --> 00:27:01.253 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:27:01.253 --> 00:27:02.221 align:middle line:84%
We started SuperCamp
because we saw a need

00:27:02.221 --> 00:27:03.556 align:middle line:90%
to teach students how to learn.

00:27:03.556 --> 00:27:06.726 align:middle line:84%
And 10 years into it, these
students are going back

00:27:06.726 --> 00:27:08.728 align:middle line:84%
into the schools, and the
schools are noticing --

00:27:08.728 --> 00:27:10.663 align:middle line:84%
we had teachers and
principals say what happened

00:27:10.663 --> 00:27:11.697 align:middle line:90%
to you over the summer...

00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:13.099 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...because they saw such
great change in the students.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.604 align:middle line:84%
And so then, schools started
inviting us in and now,

00:27:18.604 --> 00:27:20.239 align:middle line:84%
we've been in schools
over 20 years,

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:23.242 align:middle line:90%
so we do school-wide programs.

00:27:23.242 --> 00:27:25.277 align:middle line:84%
It's about shifting the
culture in the school

00:27:25.277 --> 00:27:27.613 align:middle line:84%
so that there's a positive
school-wide culture,

00:27:27.613 --> 00:27:30.416 align:middle line:84%
and we work with teachers to
be more effective teachers.

00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:32.418 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's about
creating that excitement

00:27:32.418 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:90%
and engagement for learning.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It's about connecting kids to
the content, making it real, so.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.925 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That's no
small task, Bobbi.

00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:42.294 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is huge
to change the culture

00:27:42.294 --> 00:27:43.696 align:middle line:90%
of the school system.

00:27:43.696 --> 00:27:47.633 align:middle line:84%
I mean that was what the No
Child Left Behind Program was

00:27:47.633 --> 00:27:49.335 align:middle line:90%
trying to do, but...

00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:50.936 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: There's so
many federal programs.

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:53.839 align:middle line:84%
You have to get into the
district, get into the school,

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:55.708 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's long-term,
it's not fast.

00:27:55.708 --> 00:27:58.744 align:middle line:84%
You know, we do one day
workshops, and we -- we work --

00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:01.413 align:middle line:84%
we do that for three years,
you know, getting in there

00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:04.083 align:middle line:84%
and coaching, but the No
Child Left Behind had lots

00:28:04.083 --> 00:28:07.453 align:middle line:84%
of good intentions, but then
they would go in with mandates

00:28:07.453 --> 00:28:10.089 align:middle line:84%
and not have funding, and
there were so many challenges

00:28:10.089 --> 00:28:13.225 align:middle line:84%
and things that were not
practical so, so many schools

00:28:13.225 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:90%
and districts wanted out

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.862 align:middle line:84%
and they were saying
there's no waivers.

00:28:16.862 --> 00:28:19.598 align:middle line:84%
Our Secretary of the Education,
Ernie Duncan, at the time,

00:28:19.598 --> 00:28:21.767 align:middle line:84%
was saying I'm giving
no waivers,

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving no waivers -- this
was a couple of years ago.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.505 align:middle line:84%
But with one of our
districts that we had worked

00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:28.974 align:middle line:84%
with for 10 years, we worked
with the Superintendent

00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:31.777 align:middle line:84%
over six months, just
crafting a waiver, okay,

00:28:31.777 --> 00:28:33.612 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do
an application,

00:28:33.612 --> 00:28:37.616 align:middle line:84%
but every single thing we
did was what's best for kids.

00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:41.687 align:middle line:84%
And we got -- they supported
everyone from politicians

00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:45.324 align:middle line:84%
to all the principals, the
parents, the teachers' union,

00:28:45.324 --> 00:28:51.230 align:middle line:84%
the state school board that
I spoke in front of 100%,

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.867 align:middle line:84%
because everything they
contributed was what's best

00:28:54.867 --> 00:28:56.235 align:middle line:90%
for kids.

00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:59.171 align:middle line:84%
It's the filter, and there was
nothing you could say no to.

00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:02.641 align:middle line:84%
And we got the first and only
broad-based waiver a couple

00:29:02.641 --> 00:29:06.045 align:middle line:84%
of years ago, and I really
feel we broke the mold

00:29:06.045 --> 00:29:09.148 align:middle line:84%
that now they are
allowing states to apply

00:29:09.148 --> 00:29:13.018 align:middle line:84%
for state-wide waivers and
now we moved on to, you know,

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:16.956 align:middle line:84%
common core and other federal,
you know, national programs.

00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:18.457 align:middle line:90%
So, but made a big...

00:29:18.457 --> 00:29:20.759 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What did you say, I
mean, what did you need to say

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:24.163 align:middle line:84%
in order to -- what types
of things do you bring

00:29:24.163 --> 00:29:27.433 align:middle line:84%
into this program that
made that so alluring

00:29:27.433 --> 00:29:29.935 align:middle line:90%
to these -- to these officials?

00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:32.037 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well, actually
we raised the standards.

00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:36.075 align:middle line:84%
Here they had federal
standards and we went higher,

00:29:36.075 --> 00:29:40.446 align:middle line:84%
and every single focus of every
single thing we did was focused

00:29:40.446 --> 00:29:41.847 align:middle line:90%
on the child.

00:29:41.847 --> 00:29:43.549 align:middle line:84%
And here's something else, you
know, you hear the term college

00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:46.518 align:middle line:84%
and career readiness, that
that's where were focused.

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:47.553 align:middle line:90%
We added one.

00:29:47.553 --> 00:29:50.589 align:middle line:84%
We added citizenship
and made it first.

00:29:50.589 --> 00:29:53.292 align:middle line:84%
Not only added it, but we
put citizenship, college,

00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:57.763 align:middle line:84%
career readiness, call it C3,
and the citizenship was based

00:29:57.763 --> 00:30:00.833 align:middle line:84%
on our Eight Keys of
Excellence character program.

00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:02.801 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, we're going to
learn about that in a second,

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.103 align:middle line:90%
but speaking of focus.

00:30:04.103 --> 00:30:06.906 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are some of the
things you teach in order

00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:10.376 align:middle line:84%
to get these kids to stay
focused in the classroom

00:30:10.376 --> 00:30:13.646 align:middle line:84%
and to bring, I mean, still
stick with the curriculum,

00:30:13.646 --> 00:30:17.816 align:middle line:84%
but really embrace it rather
than just be remote learners?

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:18.817 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes, yes.

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:20.085 align:middle line:84%
Well, one is the
culture of the school.

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:22.588 align:middle line:84%
We focus on the social
and emotional aspects,

00:30:22.588 --> 00:30:23.889 align:middle line:90%
and that's so important.

00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:26.692 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just going and
learning the content is

00:30:26.692 --> 00:30:30.129 align:middle line:84%
that you take time,
that there is a vision,

00:30:30.129 --> 00:30:33.532 align:middle line:84%
there are shared beliefs,
there are shared principles.

00:30:33.532 --> 00:30:37.503 align:middle line:84%
We have agreements of how we're
going to interact together, how,

00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, the agreements of,
you know, even how we enter,

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.542 align:middle line:84%
how we communicate
with each other.

00:30:43.542 --> 00:30:44.543 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: What does that look like?

00:30:44.543 --> 00:30:45.678 align:middle line:90%
Like, can you give me an example

00:30:45.678 --> 00:30:47.413 align:middle line:84%
of what a classroom
situation is?

00:30:47.413 --> 00:30:50.015 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well, one is look
at what is the main purpose

00:30:50.015 --> 00:30:50.983 align:middle line:90%
of the school?

00:30:50.983 --> 00:30:52.418 align:middle line:84%
If the main purpose
of the school is

00:30:52.418 --> 00:30:55.654 align:middle line:84%
that we get a high score
on standardized tests,

00:30:55.654 --> 00:30:57.156 align:middle line:90%
then that's one thing.

00:30:57.156 --> 00:31:01.827 align:middle line:84%
What happens out of there
is that there's procession,

00:31:01.827 --> 00:31:05.731 align:middle line:84%
and the procession is that
okay, there may be longer hours.

00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:07.967 align:middle line:84%
There may be more kill
and drill before the test.

00:31:07.967 --> 00:31:09.335 align:middle line:90%
There may be more stress.

00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:13.772 align:middle line:84%
There may be teaching to the
test, rather than just good --

00:31:13.772 --> 00:31:17.543 align:middle line:84%
you know, and so that we put
a different main purpose,

00:31:17.543 --> 00:31:19.244 align:middle line:90%
or focus of the school.

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:21.547 align:middle line:84%
Main vision -- well,
ours would be on academic

00:31:21.547 --> 00:31:22.748 align:middle line:90%
and personal excellence.

00:31:22.748 --> 00:31:25.551 align:middle line:84%
Ours would be on engaged
joyous learning, you know,

00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine if you have a
school that you want every child

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.992 align:middle line:84%
to be engaged, and curious, and
love learning, and not be afraid

00:31:32.992 --> 00:31:36.495 align:middle line:84%
of making mistakes, and raise
their hands and ask questions,

00:31:36.495 --> 00:31:39.631 align:middle line:84%
you know, so, and it's
what you're reinforcing.

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:41.667 align:middle line:84%
Also, that relationships
are important, you know,

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:43.402 align:middle line:84%
that you get to know
about your students.

00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:45.037 align:middle line:90%
You get in their world.

00:31:45.037 --> 00:31:48.974 align:middle line:84%
You know, you know how --
what music they listen to,

00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:52.444 align:middle line:84%
how they interact,
you know, you just get

00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:53.912 align:middle line:90%
to know them, talk with them.

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:56.515 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you can teach
that to almost any educator?

00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:57.182 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:31:57.182 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh absolutely.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.018 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Because they care.

00:31:59.018 --> 00:32:00.019 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:01.487 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now what happens
when the culture

00:32:01.487 --> 00:32:03.355 align:middle line:90%
at home does not support this?

00:32:03.355 --> 00:32:04.757 align:middle line:90%
If there's a home culture

00:32:04.757 --> 00:32:07.259 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't support engaged
learning, and active learning?

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:08.293 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:10.396 align:middle line:84%
Well, one is it's,
you know, community.

00:32:10.396 --> 00:32:12.164 align:middle line:84%
Coming from that
tone of community

00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:15.434 align:middle line:84%
that the schools engage,
they're sending material home,

00:32:15.434 --> 00:32:17.770 align:middle line:84%
they have programs
for the parents.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:18.704 align:middle line:90%
We have so many studies...

00:32:18.704 --> 00:32:20.039 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:21.206 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...done on our -- on
our program, and one that I

00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:24.276 align:middle line:84%
like so much, a statistic
that came back.

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:26.512 align:middle line:84%
There was a school
in a control school,

00:32:26.512 --> 00:32:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and they went out
to the parents.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.616 align:middle line:84%
Wanted to ask them how much
they knew about what was going

00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:32.684 align:middle line:84%
on in the school
and what was it.

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:35.854 align:middle line:84%
In our Quantum Learning
School, the parents, you know,

00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:38.624 align:middle line:84%
it was about 85% on their
score of what they knew.

00:32:38.624 --> 00:32:41.160 align:middle line:84%
They knew most of what
was going on in the school

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.429 align:middle line:84%
and the other school
was down about 15%.

00:32:43.429 --> 00:32:44.696 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.432 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: And it was because
the students were excited

00:32:46.432 --> 00:32:47.633 align:middle line:90%
about learning.

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:49.701 align:middle line:84%
They were coming home and
talking to their parents

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.137 align:middle line:84%
about what they were
learning, you know,

00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:54.073 align:middle line:84%
[background talking]
getting the parents engaged

00:32:54.073 --> 00:32:55.307 align:middle line:90%
that way and that's important.

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:57.276 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: In some ways even
reeducating the parents,

00:32:57.276 --> 00:32:58.977 align:middle line:84%
because that's not
how we learned.

00:32:58.977 --> 00:32:59.578 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: I know.

00:32:59.578 --> 00:33:00.546 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:33:00.546 --> 00:33:02.214 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What a wonderful
opportunity.

00:33:02.214 --> 00:33:05.651 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: And with SuperCamp, of
course, we have a parent meeting

00:33:05.651 --> 00:33:09.388 align:middle line:84%
and we teach the parents a lot
of the skills, communication

00:33:09.388 --> 00:33:11.924 align:middle line:84%
and learning skills, and how to
read better, and how to focus,

00:33:11.924 --> 00:33:13.258 align:middle line:90%
and how to get organized...

00:33:13.258 --> 00:33:14.093 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: My goodness.

00:33:14.093 --> 00:33:15.828 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: ...and how to apologize

00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:18.464 align:middle line:84%
to each other, and
all these skills.

00:33:18.464 --> 00:33:20.599 align:middle line:84%
And then when they go back
and use them in their home,

00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:90%
it makes a big difference.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.835 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Huge.

00:33:22.835 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Now are these -- is the
Quantum Learning Program

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.772 align:middle line:84%
in private schools,
public schools,

00:33:26.772 --> 00:33:29.541 align:middle line:84%
what types of schools have you
indoctrinated the program in?

00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:30.742 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well, we're
in all schools.

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Most of the schools we're

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.579 align:middle line:84%
in are what are called
Title One schools

00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
because they get
federal funding.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.918 align:middle line:84%
They're the lower income
schools, so that's where we are

00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:42.654 align:middle line:84%
at -- for the most part,
but we also have worked

00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:44.490 align:middle line:90%
with private schools, as well.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.426 align:middle line:84%
We've done senior retreats
for private schools,

00:33:47.426 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of schools.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.563 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And how many
schools is the program in?

00:33:51.563 --> 00:33:52.698 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: It's in thousands
of schools.

00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:53.665 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Thousands, wow.

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:54.867 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: I can't even
count anymore.

00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:57.736 align:middle line:84%
We've trained over 100,000
teachers, and when --

00:33:57.736 --> 00:33:59.004 align:middle line:90%
this is over 20 years,

00:33:59.004 --> 00:34:01.140 align:middle line:84%
so we look to see how many
teachers we've trained

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.408 align:middle line:84%
and how many students
they're impacting.

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:04.543 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: My goodness.

00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:06.011 align:middle line:84%
So, now there's a
foundational program here,

00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:07.479 align:middle line:90%
which is the Eight Keys.

00:34:07.479 --> 00:34:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.481 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And that's part of
the curriculum that goes

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:11.816 align:middle line:90%
into the QLN Program, right?

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:12.885 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:14.419 align:middle line:84%
It's foundational to
all of our programs.

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:18.724 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's building a core
of who you are, and that shift

00:34:18.724 --> 00:34:23.495 align:middle line:84%
that happens when you're living
principles that you -- you --

00:34:23.495 --> 00:34:24.930 align:middle line:90%
that guide you in life.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:27.466 align:middle line:84%
So, if there's a decision,
or what you're making,

00:34:27.466 --> 00:34:29.968 align:middle line:84%
it's a guidance set of
principles to get you

00:34:29.968 --> 00:34:31.836 align:middle line:84%
where you are to
where you want to be

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:34.072 align:middle line:84%
that we call the Eight
Keys of Excellence,

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:36.575 align:middle line:84%
because excellence is
such an important word.

00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:39.278 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, these
are also taught

00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:40.879 align:middle line:90%
to the parents, as well, right?

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:42.381 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yeah, everyone.

00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:45.083 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have community-wide
programs where we teach it

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:48.086 align:middle line:84%
in the schools, where we
have the administration,

00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:51.222 align:middle line:84%
the leaders learn the Eight Keys
of Excellence, and lead them.

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:54.526 align:middle line:84%
And then the teachers, and the
teachers teach the students,

00:34:54.526 --> 00:34:57.129 align:middle line:84%
and then we've also,
in some communities,

00:34:57.129 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:90%
gotten corporate sponsors,

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.866 align:middle line:84%
and the corporations are
bringing the Eight Keys

00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:03.168 align:middle line:84%
of Excellence in and
coming to meetings, and...

00:35:03.168 --> 00:35:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.738 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: You know, what we want to
do is just gather the community

00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:09.508 align:middle line:84%
around the students and hold
them [background talking]...

00:35:09.508 --> 00:35:10.943 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: As much as
you possibly can.

00:35:10.943 --> 00:35:11.476 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: ...environment.

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:12.544 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:13.679 align:middle line:84%
So, now how do these
types of things -- -

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:14.947 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look at
a video in just a second

00:35:14.947 --> 00:35:18.283 align:middle line:84%
on the Eight Keys, but how
do these principles apply

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to when they have to do SATs
and state testing, and so forth,

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.522 align:middle line:90%
when those tests still exist.

00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have
childhood memories

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.892 align:middle line:90%
of those [laughter] tests.

00:35:26.892 --> 00:35:28.227 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:35:28.227 --> 00:35:30.729 align:middle line:84%
Well, we teach them so many
skills for good learning --

00:35:30.729 --> 00:35:33.665 align:middle line:84%
effective learning, where
they're preparing for the test,

00:35:33.665 --> 00:35:36.235 align:middle line:84%
and it's not cramming
at the end,

00:35:36.235 --> 00:35:38.937 align:middle line:84%
but it's really learning
how they learn best,

00:35:38.937 --> 00:35:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and giving them mini
success moments, you know,

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.408 align:middle line:84%
that just keeps building
over time,

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:46.211 align:middle line:84%
so the motivation is
high, but all of that.

00:35:46.211 --> 00:35:49.147 align:middle line:84%
But then, with the Eight
Keys of Excellence, you know,

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:52.184 align:middle line:90%
we teach the principles.

00:35:52.184 --> 00:35:55.621 align:middle line:84%
We have our eight keys
and each one has its own,

00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:57.789 align:middle line:84%
but to do it it's, you
know, that integrity.

00:35:57.789 --> 00:36:00.192 align:middle line:84%
Looking at your values
and what your actions are,

00:36:00.192 --> 00:36:01.627 align:middle line:90%
your behaviors.

00:36:01.627 --> 00:36:05.097 align:middle line:84%
So, if you're valuing learning,
if you're valuing doing well

00:36:05.097 --> 00:36:08.100 align:middle line:84%
in life, you look what
actions are you doing?

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.669 align:middle line:84%
We have failure leads
to success, which is,

00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:13.438 align:middle line:84%
learn from mistakes,
and that is so...

00:36:13.438 --> 00:36:14.239 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Huge.

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: ...big for students.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you have
a mindset of excited

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:84%
about learning and
dive in and take risks,

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.782 align:middle line:90%
and then make mistakes.

00:36:23.782 --> 00:36:26.551 align:middle line:84%
We have three questions
after they make a mistake.

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:90%
It's, you know, what happened?

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.521 align:middle line:90%
What did you learn?

00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:30.856 align:middle line:84%
What will you do
differently next time?

00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:33.058 align:middle line:90%
And that's forward-thinking.

00:36:33.058 --> 00:36:35.827 align:middle line:84%
That pulls you forward no
matter what age you are,

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:37.162 align:middle line:90%
it pulls you forward.

00:36:37.162 --> 00:36:38.263 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Pulls you
out of the moment

00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:40.499 align:middle line:84%
of whatever the failure
might be, as well.

00:36:40.499 --> 00:36:41.199 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:42.301 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Very, very good.

00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:43.902 align:middle line:84%
All right let's take
a look at this video,

00:36:43.902 --> 00:36:46.838 align:middle line:84%
and it pretty much goes over the
eight keys in a wonderful way.

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:56.715 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music] We really
need to bring excellence back

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.787 align:middle line:84%
as a standard that we all
commit to, and that we know how

00:37:01.787 --> 00:37:05.123 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and bring
that level of excellence,

00:37:05.123 --> 00:37:07.626 align:middle line:84%
which is to excel,
back into our --

00:37:07.626 --> 00:37:11.997 align:middle line:84%
into our life, and I think that
what we need to do is primarily,

00:37:11.997 --> 00:37:14.967 align:middle line:84%
right now, is teach this
to our children in schools.

00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:24.042 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.848 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music] You
know it's really scary

00:37:29.848 --> 00:37:31.416 align:middle line:84%
where we are right
now when we look

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:33.185 align:middle line:90%
at what's happening with kids.

00:37:33.185 --> 00:37:37.989 align:middle line:84%
They have so much pressure
on them right now to succeed.

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two factors
that improve good character

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.596 align:middle line:84%
and effectively prevent
bad behavior.

00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:84%
They are positive relationships
with one's family, and the sense

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.569 align:middle line:84%
of connectedness to
school [applause].

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.072 align:middle line:84%
The Eight Keys of Excellence
make a powerful difference

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:57.809 align:middle line:84%
in schools and in families who
integrate the Eight Keys Program

00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.545 align:middle line:84%
into their conversations
and activities.

00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I see a difference
in the students,

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.449 align:middle line:84%
because they're using
the language of the keys,

00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:06.118 align:middle line:84%
and I see a difference
with the teachers,

00:38:06.118 --> 00:38:09.721 align:middle line:84%
because it's a great tool for
them to use in the classroom

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:11.957 align:middle line:84%
to have conversations
about character.

00:38:11.957 --> 00:38:15.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the problems that
the kids have are either gossip,

00:38:15.594 --> 00:38:18.563 align:middle line:84%
or they're different --
somebody's bullying them,

00:38:18.563 --> 00:38:20.866 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, or they
can have internal problems,

00:38:20.866 --> 00:38:22.434 align:middle line:90%
just like family problems.

>> At the end of year award
ceremony, the eighth grade boy

00:38:25.537 --> 00:38:27.039 align:middle line:90%
and girl of the year were chosen

00:38:27.039 --> 00:38:29.174 align:middle line:84%
because of the qualities
they have

00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:30.375 align:middle line:90%
that are like the eight keys.

>> I use integrity
by being honest.

00:38:32.711 --> 00:38:34.946 align:middle line:84%
There have been times where
I've referred to the keys.

00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:37.082 align:middle line:84%
I'd be doing something
and then I'd realize --

00:38:37.082 --> 00:38:38.683 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is actually
one of the keys.

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:39.751 align:middle line:90%
It was like were times

00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:41.052 align:middle line:84%
when I didn't even
know I was using them.

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.054 align:middle line:84%
Today I wonder, you
know, if these keys --

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:45.657 align:middle line:84%
if these eight keys of
excellence weren't here,

00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:47.092 align:middle line:84%
would I still have
done what I did?

00:38:47.092 --> 00:38:50.929 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music] We need
to create a shift in education.

00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:54.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Character is so important
for kids because they need

00:38:54.633 --> 00:38:59.204 align:middle line:84%
to be taught the values,
and they need to be modeled

00:38:59.204 --> 00:39:01.606 align:middle line:84%
for them what those
values look like.

00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The Eight Keys of Excellence
give the students what

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.144 align:middle line:90%
they need.

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:09.014 align:middle line:84%
It gives them a package
where they can say, "Oh,

00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:11.249 align:middle line:84%
this is how I'm supposed
to live my life.

00:39:11.249 --> 00:39:14.419 align:middle line:84%
If I want to be successful,
if I want to live a life

00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:17.923 align:middle line:84%
of excellence, then these
are the eight keys I can use

00:39:17.923 --> 00:39:19.891 align:middle line:90%
in my life to attain that."

00:39:19.891 --> 00:39:21.159 align:middle line:90%
>> When we give them something

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:84%
with more substance then
we're preparing them to win.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:28.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine the impact of that
as they go out into society.

00:39:28.467 --> 00:39:32.404 align:middle line:84%

to live a life that matters.

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:36.408 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's really
scary where we are right now,

00:39:36.408 --> 00:39:38.276 align:middle line:84%
and we look at what's
happening with kids.

00:39:38.276 --> 00:39:40.879 align:middle line:90%
There is more use of alcohol,

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:84%
more kids are taking drugs then
this is really causing more kids

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:46.718 align:middle line:90%
to be depressed.

00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:49.855 align:middle line:84%
This is not the kind of
world any of us would choose,

00:39:49.855 --> 00:39:56.528 align:middle line:84%
so ask yourself who is leading
our kids in creating a future

00:39:56.528 --> 00:40:00.098 align:middle line:84%
of positive personal
responsibility, integrity,

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:04.069 align:middle line:84%

you used the word excellence --

00:40:39.704 --> 00:40:41.339 align:middle line:90%
Eight Keys of Excellence.

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:43.175 align:middle line:84%
What is the distinction
around excellence.

00:40:43.175 --> 00:40:44.676 align:middle line:84%
There's something
important there

00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:46.177 align:middle line:90%
that I want to get [laughter].

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:49.114 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well the definition
in the dictionary is

00:40:49.114 --> 00:40:52.584 align:middle line:84%
about greatness,
worth, but the one I

00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:55.186 align:middle line:84%
like is good qualities
and high degree.

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:56.688 align:middle line:90%
And we think about, you know,

00:40:56.688 --> 00:40:59.624 align:middle line:84%
in science a scientist can
take a core sample of the rock

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:02.961 align:middle line:84%
to look at the qualities inside,
so you can ask people, you know,

00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:04.563 align:middle line:90%
if I took a core sample,...

00:41:04.563 --> 00:41:05.964 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Of you.

00:41:05.964 --> 00:41:09.167 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...what qualities of you
-- what qualities would I find?

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:12.671 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to build up
a strong core of qualities,

00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:15.173 align:middle line:84%
and the difference between
excellence and perfection --

00:41:15.173 --> 00:41:18.843 align:middle line:84%
I love this Michael J. Fox
quote, because he said,

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:22.714 align:middle line:84%
"I am careful not to confuse
excellence with perfection.

00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:24.749 align:middle line:84%
Excellence I can
do something about,

00:41:24.749 --> 00:41:26.651 align:middle line:84%
and perfection is
God's business."

00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:28.653 align:middle line:90%
So, it's just the mindset.

00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:32.324 align:middle line:84%
It's a mindset that everything
you do you're giving your best

00:41:32.324 --> 00:41:34.659 align:middle line:84%
effort to be your best
self, and that's a --

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:36.728 align:middle line:90%
that's a big distinction too,

00:41:36.728 --> 00:41:40.298 align:middle line:84%
because giving our best
effort, we have control.

00:41:40.298 --> 00:41:44.269 align:middle line:84%
Getting 100%, getting
a straight A, you know,

00:41:44.269 --> 00:41:49.207 align:middle line:84%
getting a financial goal, all
of those things we can strive,

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:52.611 align:middle line:84%
we can take action, but we
can't 100% know that we're going

00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:54.946 align:middle line:84%
to do it, but we can
always give our best effort.

00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:56.715 align:middle line:84%
So, when you're giving your
best effort, you feel good

00:41:56.715 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:84%
about yourself and
what you're doing.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:02.287 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: When you ask a child what
their core values are, I mean,

00:42:02.287 --> 00:42:03.955 align:middle line:84%
most adults don't
even know that.

00:42:03.955 --> 00:42:06.091 align:middle line:84%
What types of answers
do they give you?

00:42:06.091 --> 00:42:08.093 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Oh, they're wonderful.

00:42:08.093 --> 00:42:10.762 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we work with a lot of
teenagers, but I've also done it

00:42:10.762 --> 00:42:13.531 align:middle line:84%
to K-2 -- Kindergarten
to second graders.

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:14.866 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, wow!

00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:16.501 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: And I asked what, you
know, I was almost doing it

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:18.436 align:middle line:84%
as a rhetorical question,
you know,

00:42:18.436 --> 00:42:20.672 align:middle line:84%
it's like what quality's
inside of you?

00:42:20.672 --> 00:42:22.607 align:middle line:90%
And I was going to go on.

00:42:22.607 --> 00:42:24.075 align:middle line:90%
Every hand went up.

00:42:24.075 --> 00:42:27.045 align:middle line:84%
Every hand went up, and these
students were going, you know,

00:42:27.045 --> 00:42:32.017 align:middle line:84%
my friend, my family, you know,
going to school, my pet, I mean,

00:42:32.017 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:84%
they had, you know, taking
care of my pet, you know,

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.789 align:middle line:84%
being a good person,
begin happy.

00:42:37.789 --> 00:42:39.157 align:middle line:90%
All those things came out.

00:42:39.157 --> 00:42:42.394 align:middle line:84%
It was so beautiful and they
wrote them on colored pieces

00:42:42.394 --> 00:42:45.397 align:middle line:84%
of paper, and we crumpled them
up and we had a cylinder --

00:42:45.397 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:84%
a glass cylinder and we stuffed
it full of good qualities...

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.302 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh, nice.

00:42:50.302 --> 00:42:51.603 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...and it's an anchor
for them to see what kind

00:42:51.603 --> 00:42:53.571 align:middle line:90%
of good qualities they carry in.

00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:90%
And then it's as a group.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.741 align:middle line:84%
As they come together
as a school,

00:42:56.741 --> 00:42:58.576 align:middle line:84%
as they come together
[background talking].

00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:01.479 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Those qualities don't
change that much as adults.

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:04.149 align:middle line:90%
I mean, family, and being happy,

00:43:04.149 --> 00:43:06.084 align:middle line:84%
and a good person,
and a good friend.

00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:08.353 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Making a difference,
that comes up too, a lot.

00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:12.123 align:middle line:84%
We just want to make a
difference, make a contribution.

00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:13.291 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:43:13.291 --> 00:43:14.893 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting
thought, because our values,

00:43:14.893 --> 00:43:18.630 align:middle line:84%
if we identify them, even in the
school level, or now, I mean,

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.232 align:middle line:84%
it's never too late to
identify your values,

00:43:21.232 --> 00:43:23.735 align:middle line:90%
they don't change that much...

00:43:23.735 --> 00:43:24.569 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: No.

00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: ...throughout your life.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.406 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: And being of service
and making a contribution,

00:43:28.406 --> 00:43:30.075 align:middle line:90%
most people will feel good,

00:43:30.075 --> 00:43:32.477 align:middle line:84%
and what happens is
it brings fulfillment.

00:43:32.477 --> 00:43:34.379 align:middle line:84%
One of our Eight Keys of
Excellence is balance,

00:43:34.379 --> 00:43:36.581 align:middle line:84%
and I used to think it
was one-third, one-third,

00:43:36.581 --> 00:43:38.717 align:middle line:84%
one-third in my life, and then
I thought, I'm not leading

00:43:38.717 --> 00:43:40.418 align:middle line:84%
at this, you know, like
one-third personal,

00:43:40.418 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:84%
one-third family,
one-third work.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.321 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: But when you get involved
in what you're passionate about,

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
what you love to do, what's
contributing to others,

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.396 align:middle line:84%
and it just feels so
blessed to find something

00:43:51.396 --> 00:43:53.231 align:middle line:84%
that you just love,
you're passionate about,

00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and it contributes
to other people.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.134 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:57.335 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: It's fulfillment,
you know.

00:43:57.335 --> 00:43:58.303 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:43:58.303 --> 00:43:59.504 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Every day
you feel fulfilled.

00:43:59.504 --> 00:44:02.273 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yes, yes, absolutely,
which is what I do.

00:44:02.273 --> 00:44:04.342 align:middle line:84%
I've got so many questions
for you [laughter],

00:44:04.342 --> 00:44:06.945 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not fulfilled unless
I ask them [laughter].

00:44:06.945 --> 00:44:10.382 align:middle line:84%
Technology -- what -- technology
presents an enormous amount

00:44:10.382 --> 00:44:15.487 align:middle line:84%
of challenges for students these
days, as well as, attributes.

00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:18.189 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with
technology in the camps,

00:44:18.189 --> 00:44:20.492 align:middle line:84%
and in the school
systems, and so forth.

00:44:20.492 --> 00:44:21.126 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Right.

00:44:21.126 --> 00:44:22.494 align:middle line:90%
Well, first of all

00:44:22.494 --> 00:44:25.563 align:middle line:84%
with SuperCamp we take their
cellphones and technology away,

00:44:25.563 --> 00:44:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and some -- the students are so
connected its like, oh my gosh.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.001 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:44:30.001 --> 00:44:31.002 align:middle line:84%
It's like pulling an
umbilical cord, right?

00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:31.569 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: It is.

00:44:31.569 --> 00:44:32.937 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:44:32.937 --> 00:44:34.272 align:middle line:84%
And we've only had it for a
couple of years [laughter], so.

00:44:34.272 --> 00:44:35.707 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: When they're in
the program it's all

00:44:35.707 --> 00:44:36.941 align:middle line:90%
about total immersion.

00:44:36.941 --> 00:44:39.043 align:middle line:90%
It's eye-to-eye communication.

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:41.446 align:middle line:84%
It's them really
having time to think.

00:44:41.446 --> 00:44:45.483 align:middle line:84%
Now, technology is here to stay,
and there's so many advantages

00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and connected, and things
we never dreamed possible,

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.689 align:middle line:84%
so students, you know, that
they can find information,

00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.091 align:middle line:90%
they can make connections,

00:44:53.091 --> 00:44:56.161 align:middle line:84%
there's just unlimited
thing they can do

00:44:56.161 --> 00:44:58.930 align:middle line:90%
and learn from technology.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:02.333 align:middle line:84%
But, what it so important that
they take time to breathe,

00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:04.836 align:middle line:84%
that they take time to
look at another person

00:45:04.836 --> 00:45:07.438 align:middle line:84%
and have a conversation
eyeball to eyeball.

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:09.607 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what the
long-term effects are going

00:45:09.607 --> 00:45:11.242 align:middle line:90%
to be, because there's a lot

00:45:11.242 --> 00:45:14.245 align:middle line:84%
of brain science behind
the importance of being

00:45:14.245 --> 00:45:16.815 align:middle line:84%
with another person and
connecting with them,

00:45:16.815 --> 00:45:19.784 align:middle line:84%
the relational part,
so that's, you know,

00:45:19.784 --> 00:45:20.885 align:middle line:90%
I think that's going...

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:21.653 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:45:21.653 --> 00:45:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: ...show over time.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.488 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:26.424 align:middle line:84%
What about the issues
of violence in schools

00:45:26.424 --> 00:45:30.094 align:middle line:84%
and bullying, and this seems to
be such a situation these days

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:32.564 align:middle line:84%
that people are trying to
come up with a solution to,

00:45:32.564 --> 00:45:33.865 align:middle line:90%
but seem to be coming short,

00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:35.600 align:middle line:84%
because it's still
pretty rampant in schools.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.736 align:middle line:84%
What are your suggestions
around that, just, you know,

00:45:38.736 --> 00:45:40.171 align:middle line:90%
talking on a social level?

00:45:40.171 --> 00:45:41.372 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Right.

00:45:41.372 --> 00:45:42.707 align:middle line:84%
You know, the first
thing that comes up is --

00:45:42.707 --> 00:45:48.046 align:middle line:84%
and again more science behind
-- with teenagers, the --

00:45:48.046 --> 00:45:51.716 align:middle line:84%
there's a nerve between where
their thinking part of the brain

00:45:51.716 --> 00:45:54.652 align:middle line:84%
and back in the emotional part
of the brain, and it peaks

00:45:54.652 --> 00:45:56.855 align:middle line:90%
for need to belong at 15.

00:45:56.855 --> 00:46:00.124 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, that there is
such a strong need to belong

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:04.162 align:middle line:84%
and in so many schools the
gang is where you can belong.

00:46:04.162 --> 00:46:07.265 align:middle line:84%
To be cool, you need
to be part of a gang.

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.667 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: And with the schools
we work with, when we bring

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:11.569 align:middle line:90%
in the Eight Keys of Excellence,

00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:13.071 align:middle line:84%
one of the principals
told me once --

00:46:13.071 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and this is another favorite
line, is she said, "You know,

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.342 align:middle line:90%
that the Eight Keys

00:46:17.342 --> 00:46:21.012 align:middle line:84%
of Excellence have become
the new cool in our school."

00:46:21.012 --> 00:46:22.113 align:middle line:90%
And so, you look at...

00:46:22.113 --> 00:46:23.114 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:46:23.114 --> 00:46:25.516 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...when --
it can take time,

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:29.654 align:middle line:84%
but when you hold a context,
when you hold a culture

00:46:29.654 --> 00:46:34.025 align:middle line:84%
that this is what's expected,
and that the staff is modeling,

00:46:34.025 --> 00:46:38.963 align:middle line:84%
and living, and holding to that
line, you start building a core

00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:40.865 align:middle line:84%
and having that's
what's tolerated,

00:46:40.865 --> 00:46:43.234 align:middle line:84%
that's what the cool
is in this school.

00:46:43.234 --> 00:46:46.905 align:middle line:84%
And we have schools that -- one
school -- a middle school --

00:46:46.905 --> 00:46:51.376 align:middle line:84%
the suspensions and expulsions
went down 30% the first year

00:46:51.376 --> 00:46:52.543 align:middle line:90%
from living the Eight Keys.

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:54.712 align:middle line:84%
And another school -- it
was a charter a school,

00:46:54.712 --> 00:46:59.250 align:middle line:84%
where they had the year
before 800 office referrals,

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:00.818 align:middle line:84%
and when they implemented
the Eight Keys,

00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:04.122 align:middle line:84%
the next following year
was 37 office referrals,

00:47:04.122 --> 00:47:06.491 align:middle line:84%
because we're finding that
the students self-monitor.

00:47:06.491 --> 00:47:08.426 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the real power is,

00:47:08.426 --> 00:47:12.163 align:middle line:84%
when the students start
monitoring each other.

00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:15.833 align:middle line:84%
One of our keys is speak with
good purpose, and, you know,

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:17.969 align:middle line:84%
they have the principals
telling me

00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:19.971 align:middle line:84%
that the students are
calling each other on it.

00:47:19.971 --> 00:47:23.174 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, what about that
speak with good purpose key or,

00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like, you might
want to rephrase that, you know.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.879 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So tools like this
are sent into the classroom,

00:47:27.879 --> 00:47:31.316 align:middle line:84%
and these types of tools
get put up into classrooms

00:47:31.316 --> 00:47:33.284 align:middle line:84%
so that they're constantly
there, so you have all sorts

00:47:33.284 --> 00:47:35.520 align:middle line:84%
of learning modules
and tools and stuff

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.621 align:middle line:90%
that go into the classroom...

00:47:36.621 --> 00:47:38.022 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:39.891 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: ...when somebody -- so
how long does it take, really,

00:47:39.891 --> 00:47:42.260 align:middle line:84%
to change the culture
of a school,

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.462 align:middle line:84%
to bring these types
of programs in.

00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:45.897 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they would
think oh, it's new,

00:47:45.897 --> 00:47:47.999 align:middle line:84%
we don't want anything
new, we want to stick

00:47:47.999 --> 00:47:49.233 align:middle line:90%
with what's not working.

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:50.535 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: I know [laughter].

00:47:50.535 --> 00:47:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. Because somebody
will say there's nothing new

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.573 align:middle line:84%
under the sun that
-- when, you know,

00:47:55.573 --> 00:47:57.375 align:middle line:90%
these have to be integrated.

00:47:57.375 --> 00:48:01.245 align:middle line:84%
We found huge change, and change
starts from the beginning.

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.447 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would
be the first week

00:48:02.447 --> 00:48:05.283 align:middle line:84%
of school you're
seeing huge change,

00:48:05.283 --> 00:48:08.953 align:middle line:84%
because when the
administration and the leaders,

00:48:08.953 --> 00:48:12.857 align:middle line:84%
when the teachers are all
living from a common purpose,

00:48:12.857 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:84%
from common principles --
the Eight Keys of Excellence,

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.463 align:middle line:84%
and in schools we work
with, they have all staff,

00:48:18.463 --> 00:48:21.699 align:middle line:84%
so maintenance, the
grounds people,

00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:23.468 align:middle line:90%
they are next to the students.

00:48:23.468 --> 00:48:26.170 align:middle line:84%
They came forward to us and
said we need to learn these

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:30.375 align:middle line:84%
and support them in the school,
so that there's a huge change,

00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:33.578 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, we have body
motions for all the keys too.

00:48:33.578 --> 00:48:35.113 align:middle line:84%
The speak with good
purpose is this...

00:48:35.113 --> 00:48:36.114 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh.

00:48:36.114 --> 00:48:37.482 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...and the
principal told me

00:48:37.482 --> 00:48:39.183 align:middle line:84%
that on the playground two kids
were fighting, and he looked

00:48:39.183 --> 00:48:41.119 align:middle line:84%
at them, and all he had to
do was look at them and go

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:43.588 align:middle line:84%
like this, and the students
looked back on him with --

00:48:43.588 --> 00:48:45.990 align:middle line:84%
their eyes got big and
they nodded their heads...

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.491 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: They knew.

00:48:46.491 --> 00:48:47.558 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:47.558 --> 00:48:48.326 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...and, you
know, just turned around

00:48:48.326 --> 00:48:49.627 align:middle line:90%
and went into the school.

00:48:49.627 --> 00:48:50.928 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I mean, I think this
is a wonderful thing also

00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:53.297 align:middle line:84%
because you add structure
to something.

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:55.733 align:middle line:84%
When you tell an
environmenter, if you try to go

00:48:55.733 --> 00:48:59.237 align:middle line:84%
and change a culture with just
philosophies and rhetoric,

00:48:59.237 --> 00:49:02.340 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't help, as much,
as when you have systems

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.008 align:middle line:90%
and structures in place

00:49:04.008 --> 00:49:07.245 align:middle line:84%
that really help provide
the guidelines for that type

00:49:07.245 --> 00:49:09.447 align:middle line:90%
of shift and change to happen.

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:12.417 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is obviously
so needed because systems

00:49:12.417 --> 00:49:15.586 align:middle line:84%
that have been federal programs
have failed and not worked

00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:20.091 align:middle line:84%
in our school systems because of
the statistics I read earlier.

00:49:20.091 --> 00:49:21.793 align:middle line:90%
So, I think it's very important.

00:49:21.793 --> 00:49:23.294 align:middle line:84%
How does a school
become involved

00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:24.662 align:middle line:90%
or adopt your type of program?

00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:27.732 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: Well, it would be calling
us and having conversations.

00:49:27.732 --> 00:49:29.967 align:middle line:84%
Usually we start with the
leadership, a conversation

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:32.637 align:middle line:84%
with the leadership to find
out what their needs are,

00:49:32.637 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:84%
what are they doing in
the school currently,

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.009 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing us
in for conversation.

00:49:38.009 --> 00:49:39.811 align:middle line:84%
You know, and when we
work with teachers,

00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:42.213 align:middle line:84%
and we do professional
development in the schools,

00:49:42.213 --> 00:49:45.950 align:middle line:84%
where they bring us in, and
that we do coaching afterwards,

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.052 align:middle line:84%
where we actually go
into their classrooms,

00:49:48.052 --> 00:49:50.655 align:middle line:84%
and we have such strong
relationships with the teachers

00:49:50.655 --> 00:49:52.356 align:middle line:84%
because not everybody
wants somebody

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.525 align:middle line:84%
in the back taking notes
when you're teaching,

00:49:54.525 --> 00:49:57.161 align:middle line:84%
and getting feedback,
but the -- we --

00:49:57.161 --> 00:50:01.032 align:middle line:84%
it's building the relationship
and teachers know what kind

00:50:01.032 --> 00:50:03.468 align:middle line:84%
of outcome they want
in the classroom.

00:50:03.468 --> 00:50:04.569 align:middle line:90%
But what we're finding is

00:50:04.569 --> 00:50:06.137 align:middle line:84%
so many don't know how
to get that outcome.

00:50:06.137 --> 00:50:08.806 align:middle line:84%
What we do is give them,
not only the tools,

00:50:08.806 --> 00:50:11.576 align:middle line:84%
and this is the most
important part, is the why.

00:50:11.576 --> 00:50:13.111 align:middle line:90%
Why, the research behind,

00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:16.447 align:middle line:84%
because you can apply a
strategy at the wrong place.

00:50:16.447 --> 00:50:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So, it could be a good strategy,
but you need to know the system.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.320 align:middle line:84%
You need to know how they
work together and what kind

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.991 align:middle line:84%
of outcome, and the why
you are doing a strategy

00:50:26.991 --> 00:50:28.893 align:middle line:84%
so that you know when
and why, you know,

00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:30.495 align:middle line:90%
the right time to apply it.

00:50:30.495 --> 00:50:31.596 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Now I understand --

00:50:31.596 --> 00:50:33.097 align:middle line:84%
you recently told me
that you have just met

00:50:33.097 --> 00:50:35.366 align:middle line:84%
with the whole superintendent
of schools...

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:36.567 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: Yes.

00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:37.401 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: ...that this is
starting to go within more

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:39.470 align:middle line:90%
than just the school systems,

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.472 align:middle line:84%
but to a higher and
higher level.

00:50:41.472 --> 00:50:42.573 align:middle line:90%
>> BD: We know what works.

00:50:42.573 --> 00:50:44.842 align:middle line:84%
We have a solution,
and we have partnered

00:50:44.842 --> 00:50:48.446 align:middle line:84%
with the National Association
of Elementary School Principals,

00:50:48.446 --> 00:50:51.649 align:middle line:84%
and AASA, which is the
National Association

00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:55.153 align:middle line:84%
for School Superintendents, to
collaborate, because it's all

00:50:55.153 --> 00:50:57.088 align:middle line:84%
around how do we
make a difference?

00:50:57.088 --> 00:50:59.323 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of good
things going on and we have

00:50:59.323 --> 00:51:03.427 align:middle line:84%
to work together, what kind
of message does that send?

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:04.195 align:middle line:90%
You know, rather than...

00:51:04.195 --> 00:51:05.296 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:51:05.296 --> 00:51:06.497 align:middle line:84%
>> BD: ...here's my
work, what I'm doing.

00:51:06.497 --> 00:51:07.598 align:middle line:90%
We work together.

00:51:07.598 --> 00:51:10.268 align:middle line:84%
Have a bigger voice,
and we really are going

00:51:10.268 --> 00:51:12.904 align:middle line:84%
after a critical mass of
working in the schools,

00:51:12.904 --> 00:51:14.739 align:middle line:84%
and saying here's
what's working.

00:51:14.739 --> 00:51:16.541 align:middle line:90%
How do we support each other

00:51:16.541 --> 00:51:19.343 align:middle line:84%

SuperCamp graduates, right now,

00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and we're on second generation,
so that keeps growing,

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.560 align:middle line:84%

parents and how that expands.

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:27.765 align:middle line:84%
We've trained over a
100 thousand teachers,

00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:29.266 align:middle line:84%
and over the years, we
[background talking] learned

to see the impact of how
many that they've impacted,

00:54:33.037 --> 00:54:35.139 align:middle line:84%
so we figure out --
we've done the math,

00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:38.342 align:middle line:84%
we're up to about 10 million
students that we've impacted.

00:54:38.342 --> 00:54:41.912 align:middle line:84%
And then, in addition to
growing our school programs,

00:54:41.912 --> 00:54:45.016 align:middle line:84%

and more countries and places,

00:54:45.016 --> 00:54:46.016 align:middle line:90%
we have a campaign --

00:56:04.662 --> 00:56:05.429 align:middle line:90%
oh, you said eight weeks?

go to the school and say,

And when schools
adopt it, they --

00:56:19.844 --> 00:56:23.047 align:middle line:84%
we do a key a month for the
schools, so it's for a --

00:56:23.047 --> 00:56:24.415 align:middle line:90%
through the school year,

00:56:24.415 --> 00:56:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and they weave it
through everything.

Through the curriculum.

00:56:27.284 --> 00:56:29.620 align:middle line:84%

through the eight keys,

00:56:32.056 --> 00:56:33.390 align:middle line:90%

and present a key talk,

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:59.517 align:middle line:84%
and make up a lesson on one

we're living it all the time.

00:57:01.118 --> 00:57:03.387 align:middle line:84%

It's authentic.

00:57:16.133 --> 00:57:18.102 align:middle line:84%
We take whatever we're
teaching, we're modeling it,

00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:20.137 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
congruent otherwise.

00:57:20.137 --> 00:57:21.505 align:middle line:90%
It's not making sense.

00:57:21.505 --> 00:57:24.008 align:middle line:84%
It has to be -- we say, you
know, excellence becomes you.

00:57:24.008 --> 00:57:25.609 align:middle line:90%
It becomes who you are.
