00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.149 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello, and welcome.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
The information that
you are about to hear

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
could radically change the
way that you live your life,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:84%
as it has for so many people who
have heard cellular biologist

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Bruce Lipton speak.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lipton is an internationally
recognized leader

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:84%
on the connection between
science and spirit.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:84%
His groundbreaking
discoveries in the field

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
of the new biology
and epigenetics,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
specifically, are the
foundation for human evolution.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:84%
He's won many awards, including
the Goi Peace Award, which

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
is the Japanese equivalent
to the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It's such an honor to have
you here with us today.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUCE LIPTON: Lisa, I
thank you so very much,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.455 align:middle line:84%
because we have some
wonderful information to share

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's very
exciting, isn't it?

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.549 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
To get this information out,
it really is transformational.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
So, you have mentioned
to me previously

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that we are in one of the
most groundbreaking times

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:90%
and critical times in history.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this many
times before, but specifically

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.084 align:middle line:84%
in the realm of science,
what does this mean?

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:17.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
specifically, science

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:84%
has revealed to us that
at the current moment,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
we are facing
imminent extinction.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:90%
And the significance is why.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's go back
and recognize this.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.151 align:middle line:90%
Five times--

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:29.483 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a huge statement.

00:01:29.483 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge statement.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.526 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Well, it is.

00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's always surprising how
science will talk about this

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and then it will just get
lost and nobody's-- it's sort

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
of like just too
big to think about.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.476 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why I had
to pause for a minute

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
there, because that's
a huge statement, yes.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
So what do you mean by that?

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, five
times in the history

00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
of this planet, life got wiped
out and started all over again,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and these are called
mass extinctions.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And the five previous
mass extinctions

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
were due to things like comets
or asteroids hitting the Earth

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and destroying the environment
and just wiping out life,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and then it started
all over again.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Science has recognized
that, today, we're

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
losing species at a
rate that is equivalent

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:90%
to the mass extinction periods.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.067 align:middle line:84%
And the significance is the
source of this mass extinction,

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
according to science,
is much closer to home

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
than those comets and
asteroids because it is now

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:84%
revealed that human behavior is
undermining the environment so

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
much that we are threatening
our own existence at this point.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to this weird fact
that, for example, science

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:84%
realizes that perhaps
within the next 30 years

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
the fish will be fished
out of the ocean.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In 30 years?

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.676 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: In about
30 years, yeah.

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:84%
We've already lost 90% of
what we call the predator

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:84%
fish, the ones that we catch for
human consumption, 90% of them

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:90%
are already gone.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And at the rate we're
harvesting fish and destroying

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the ecosystem in
which the fish evolve,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
we're actually facing
the loss of fish

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, which is
like almost a science fiction

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
concept, planet
Earth with no fish.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I mean, 30 years
is our children's generation.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is very,
very close to home.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Yes, this is
why it always is like, oh,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.052 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're talking about
some crazy stuff in politics

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
like gay marriage or
something like that,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, no, we're
facing an extinction.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's
time for us to own

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.350 align:middle line:90%
that we must act collectively.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.969 align:middle line:84%
The concept of Gaia is brought
about by James Lovelock,

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about the
Earth as a living system.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, recently, he
said it's already too late.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, kiss it
goodbye, it's gone.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing we
can do about it.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.985 align:middle line:90%
And it's like wow--

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wait a minute, yes.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: -it's kind of freaky.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:90%
But the fact is this.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
He's really not including
that human consciousness

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
is a very important part of
the unfolding of this planet.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And if we change
human consciousness,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and we have to do
it relatively soon,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
there's a great opportunity
to save what we have

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:90%
and then rebuild the garden.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you
connect this very important

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
conversation that we're
having about evolution

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and about our species on
this Earth to what you speak

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.156 align:middle line:84%
about in terms of biology and
cellular biology and science?

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
very interesting.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.571 align:middle line:84%
What we've been finding
out in the recent science

00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is that human consciousness,
the way we think

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and the way we behave,
is fundamentally

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
controlling the environment
in which we live.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, it says
that our belief systems are

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:84%
very critical to the way
we live in the world.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
today when we are just

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
destroying the environment
and making monocultures out

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
of what were just beautiful
gardens that the Earth offered,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:84%
this is totally antagonistic
to life on this planet.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
The way that we're
polluting the water,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
polluting the air, the
petrochemicals that

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
are going into the ground and
altering the animal species, as

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.750 align:middle line:84%
well as ourselves, all
of these are influential

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.607 align:middle line:84%
and yet we sort of
turn our eyes to them

00:04:47.607 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:90%
and not really look at it.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, science
is sort of saying,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
it's time to open up your
eyes because we are really

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
treading on very
dangerous territory.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So opening up our eyes,
meaning our inner environment

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.385 align:middle line:84%
as well as our
outer environment.

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.593 align:middle line:84%
This is, for me,
it's very interesting

00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
because my work, which I
published in my first book

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
called "The Biology of
Belief" really talked

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
about how our beliefs
control our personal biology

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.532 align:middle line:90%
and the life that we experience.

00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And in writing that
book, I started

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.323 align:middle line:90%
to recognize, I said well, wait.

00:05:16.323 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
If we personally
create our own lives,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:84%
what is the consequence when
thousands or millions of people

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:90%
share the exact same belief.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I
said, yes, that's what

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
manifests the reality
that we're in.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So when culture changes
its belief system,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.982 align:middle line:84%
then the cultures
change as well.

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why you
talk about, specifically

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
on the cellular level, how
it grows and how it dies

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and how it moves towards
growth in a positive state,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes
towards degeneration

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.895 align:middle line:90%
in a negative state.

00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what
our planet does, right?

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.061 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's exactly facing
that situation right now.

00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
because Mother Nature

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful gardener,
takes care of this garden.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And then what she
will do is remove

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.295 align:middle line:84%
what we would call
pests from the garden.

00:05:59.295 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Anything that gets
into the garden that

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
destroys the harmony
of the environment,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
nature will ultimately
eliminate and those things

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:90%
will go extinct.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately,
at this moment,

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:90%
we really-- we are those pests.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.519 align:middle line:84%
Human civilization is
undermining the garden.

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I don't think
that we need to be removed,

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:90%
so what are the options?

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
What is the choice
at this point?

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the choice is
to recognize how we are actually

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:84%
influencing the world and owning
the reality of human power

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.276 align:middle line:84%
in altering the state
of the environment.

00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So we have to own
that we are involved.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think oh, well,
humans can't change the Earth.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.025 align:middle line:84%
And it's like oh, my god,
yes we can and we are.

00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But how?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: We're changing
it so profoundly.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean I remember when I went
to school I studied the three

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.942 align:middle line:84%
seas in middle Europe, and they
were the ABC, the Aral Sea,

00:06:50.942 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:84%
the Black Sea, and
the Caspian Sea.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Sea.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.713 align:middle line:84%
I remember how easy it
was to remember that.

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And on the maps, you have
this beautiful picture

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.669 align:middle line:84%
of a big inland
sea, the Aral Sea.

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
satellite picture today,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:90%
the Aral Sea is gone.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
The entire sea is
essentially gone.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, what
happened to a whole sea that

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
was one of the biggest
seas in the world?

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is people
started to divert the water

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
for irrigation of crops in
a desert, and at some point

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:84%
not recognizing you can't
change these courses of nature

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.414 align:middle line:84%
without affecting a greater
segment of the environment.

00:07:21.414 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, we really have
to wake up to the fact,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:84%
yes, we are altering the
conditions of the environment,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.887 align:middle line:84%
changing agriculture,
the amount of pollution

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that we're putting into
the air, all of this

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
has a profound effect on
global climate change.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:90%
And so the significance is that.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we're looking around
saying oh, my god, the weather

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:90%
is so erratic and so changeable.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we
didn't necessarily

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.310 align:middle line:84%
create global warming,
but we are surely

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:90%
exacerbating the situation.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So how can we take this
global conversation

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to
a personal level?

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
How can we take our
thoughts and direct them

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
towards something that
goes towards growth

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:90%
and goes towards solution?

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: First to
recognize that we

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
are active participants
in the process,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
because we sort of take
ourselves out of the picture

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, the Earth is
going through this stuff.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
No, the Earth isn't
going through it.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:90%
We are creating this upheaval.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
because our beliefs

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:84%
shape our cultures
and our civilization.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it's so interesting

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
right now, for example, when
we understand the fact is this.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:84%
That civilization as we
know it is coming to an end,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.620 align:middle line:84%
as we know it is
coming to an end.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.487 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
the end of humans,

00:08:33.487 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
but it means the end of the
way of life that we're doing

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.748 align:middle line:84%
and a new civilization
is coming forward.

00:08:37.748 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
has happened before.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: This-- in
Western civilization, this

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.309 align:middle line:84%
is really the story of
Western civilization.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.037 align:middle line:84%
We go back over the
past and we say,

00:08:45.037 --> 00:08:46.495 align:middle line:84%
well, there have
been civilizations

00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%
that have come and gone.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, we talk
about the Roman civilization.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a Roman
civilization and it's gone.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:90%
And so, what happened here?

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we just quickly
look at the history

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.559 align:middle line:84%
of Western civilization,
what we find

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
is that there were
different civilizations,

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
that we started with
a civilization call

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Animism, which is sort of
like the Native Americans,

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
the indigenous
people that learned

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
to live in harmony
with the world.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is where we really
ultimately have to go back.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:84%
If you just consider what
the Native Americans said,

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
for example, that this is
a garden and their role

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:90%
was to tend the garden.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Losing that-- we left
that Animistic period

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.379 align:middle line:84%
and then entered into a
period call Polytheism.

00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
different civilization

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:84%
where the Romans, the Greeks,
the Egyptians, many gods,

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, came up.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
That, like the Roman
civilization, ended.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And the new civilization
that came out of that

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:90%
was called Monotheism.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:84%
That's when the Church
of Rome, for example,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
gave the organization
and culture to the people

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
even that civilization

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
came to an end about 1870
after Charles Darwin introduced

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
the notion of a biological
source of evolution

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
rather than the concept
of Genesis, for example.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, in that
place of Monotheism,

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:84%
where we had the
particular culture that

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
was wrapped around various
religious beliefs and so forth,

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.973 align:middle line:84%
was that designed originally
to grow a society?

00:10:13.973 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, It's
very interesting.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.344 align:middle line:84%
Many things start out
with a very positive

00:10:18.344 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:84%
this is what we're going
to do for the people.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.884 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a very interesting
insight if you think about it.

00:10:22.884 --> 00:10:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Many organizations start
out helping people.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Health care, OK,
education, government.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
their original work

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
was indeed really
helping and facilitating

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:90%
the growth of a population.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.506 align:middle line:84%
But if you look back at it,
this is an interesting point,

00:10:37.506 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
is that when they
reach a certain size,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
they become an
institution themselves.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.387 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
it's like academia first

00:10:44.387 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
was just some teachers
teaching, but then it

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.207 align:middle line:90%
became a university.

00:10:47.207 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And the significance,
once the institution

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
became so prominent, then the
efforts of the organization

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
actually then are not so
much on helping the people,

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
but on sustaining
the organization,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.047 align:middle line:84%
so that we lose the
benefit for the people

00:11:03.047 --> 00:11:04.755 align:middle line:84%
but we build these
massive organizations.

00:11:04.755 --> 00:11:05.588 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:11:05.588 --> 00:11:07.147 align:middle line:84%
It happens with
the justice system,

00:11:07.147 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:90%
it happens with all of it.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.555 align:middle line:90%
It starts--

00:11:08.555 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Health care.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: -to take on its own.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Its own entity essentially.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So basically,
they start out pretty good

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.624 align:middle line:90%
and then they go awry.

00:11:15.624 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that, though?

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Why does that happen?

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, I just
think there's some effort

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.549 align:middle line:84%
to think well, maybe, if we put
more control, that we control

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's a concept
of if I can control it,

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.490 align:middle line:90%
then we can guide its direction.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Except, it's OK to
have an idea of control

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:90%
if you have knowledge.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have knowledge,
then all of a sudden

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
your control may
go way off the edge

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and actually you're not
helping people anymore,

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:84%
but the net result is really
the damage that is accruing.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And so as you can see
for this situation,

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
we are in a civilization
that is coming to an end.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.414 align:middle line:84%
And we started off
with a concept--

00:11:52.414 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As we knew it.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: As we know it.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And it's coming to an
end for a very simple reason.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.758 align:middle line:84%
We look around the world
and we see all these crises.

00:11:58.758 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we have a peak fuel crisis,
we have an economic crisis,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
we have political crises,
we have health care crisis.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:84%
We're even facing
religious crises.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And you say, well, wait.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.284 align:middle line:84%
Oh, let's talk about this
crisis or this crisis.

00:12:11.284 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And I go no, no.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:90%
You're missing the point.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Talking about each crisis
is like looking at this tree

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and here's another tree
and here's another tree.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
The whole point is
pull back and recognize

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
all the trees are
making a forest.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:84%
The crises, we see them
as individual events,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
are collectively saying
this is not sustainable

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and that we're seeing
the feedback of we're

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
going in the wrong direction and
it's coming back in our face,

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:84%
threatening our survival on this
particular planet right now.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you had said now
we went from the Monotheism

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:90%
into the survivalistic--

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Scientific
from Monotheism.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:84%
The current version
of civilization

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:84%
is officially
Scientific Materialism.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So you know what's
very interesting

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to talk about is
that civilizations

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:90%
are like living things, OK?

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:90%
They have a life cycle.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations are created and
then they mature, and then

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.777 align:middle line:84%
at some point they start
to go into a decline.

00:13:05.777 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
because in the beginning

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.276 align:middle line:84%
of a civilization, just like
in the beginning of a child's

00:13:10.276 --> 00:13:13.320 align:middle line:84%
life, it's a period filled
with a lot of development.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a period filled with let's
try this and let's try this.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And as a civilization matures,
or as an individual matures,

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:84%
then you get like
very rigid beliefs.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the belief,
this is the way it is.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And then when those
rigid beliefs come in,

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
this is the mature
state, so-called, OK?

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a
problem with rigidity.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
If you live in a universe
were nothing stays the same,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
it's always dynamically
moving, how can a civilization

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:84%
hold on to a belief
and say this is

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:90%
the only belief that we have?

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, when we
hold these beliefs

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and we hold that
rigid nature of it,

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:90%
inevitably leads to challenges.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So that we go from a rigid
state of this is the way it is

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and we start living that
way like we are now,

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and the result is
but if we're not

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:84%
living in harmony with the
planet, then the challenges

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that we're facing are
the crises that we see.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
crises referring to?

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
They're referring
to the fact the way

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
you are living on the planet is
not in harmony with the planet.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is then
the period where

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:90%
civilization goes into decline.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So what you're looking
at now is a world that

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:84%
seems to be falling apart,
which it is actually,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.070 align:middle line:84%
but what's most interesting is
just because a civilization is

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
ending, doesn't mean
humans are gone.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a new civilization in
the process of being built.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:84%
There's always one
civilization follows another.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.839 align:middle line:90%
So right now--

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking with somebody
on the way here today

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and he was saying that
change has happened

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
so much in his own
life, and his--

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
he gave himself an
analogy as a ship.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was a
ship in the ocean

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was going steady for
so many years and so many

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
years, and all of a sudden,
it wasn't working anymore

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:90%
to go steady.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Things kept changing around me
and corporations were folding

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and environments were
shifting and changing.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:84%
You basically described
the cycle of life.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So in people thinking
that you can go along

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:84%
in a normal course, these days
it is no longer applicable.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: No, because
the belief systems--

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:84%
the very fundamental
belief systems

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.275 align:middle line:84%
that shape the culture and
the character of the way

00:15:07.275 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:90%
we live on this planet.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we live by belief,
what we think is right,

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:90%
so we follow this path.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:84%
If the belief is not right,
then the path we're following

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.746 align:middle line:90%
is going to lead to a dead end.

00:15:16.746 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
interesting because we're

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
starting to see it
fall apart right now.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.532 align:middle line:84%
And yet, while people
are getting nervous

00:15:22.532 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:84%
about it falling
apart, I'm the guy

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the room that's
jumping up and down going,

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.390 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's falling apart.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
very simply this.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:84%
If we continue the
course we're on,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
science has already
revealed what

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:90%
the destination is, extinction.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So basically it says,
what do we need to do?

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:90%
We need to--

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Change the course.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: -really reset.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Change the course.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.844 align:middle line:84%
Look at life in a different
way and start over again.

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because we're

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.212 align:middle line:84%
facing like the Occupy
Wall Street Movement.

00:15:49.212 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:90%
What does it represent?

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
People that are saying,
this isn't working anymore

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's got
to be another way.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is great
because, as I said,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.672 align:middle line:84%
keeping the status quo is
death and that opening up

00:16:00.672 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:90%
is something new.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So a new civilization
begins when

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:84%
people start to pull
out of the structure

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and start to consider
another way of life.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And we call these people
creative minorities

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
or cultural creatives,
the Millennial Group.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Millennial
Group, and this

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:84%
is profound because this is
nearly half the population

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:84%
of the United States or
the planet right now.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The Millennials.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: The Millennials.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 20-somethings.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
actually under 40.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.134 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Under 40, OK.

00:16:31.134 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Under 40.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And this represents an
interesting group of people

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
because these young people
are finding it very difficult

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:90%
to get into the structure.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:90%
They go to school.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:90%
They accumulate debt like crazy.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:84%
They get out of school
and then there's no jobs.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And then they
start to feel like, well, I'm

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:90%
not part of the system.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And many of them are like,
what are we going to do?

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:90%
We're not part of the system.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh, wait, wait.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.934 align:middle line:90%
You don't understand.

00:16:52.934 --> 00:16:55.424 align:middle line:84%
You're playing--
The Millennials play

00:16:55.424 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
roles on this planet

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
right now for a
very simple reason.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Not being part of
the system means

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:84%
they're not attached
to the system.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're not
part of the old system.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.706 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: They're not part
of the old system at all.

00:17:07.706 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And when fewer and
fewer people are

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
holding on to the old
system, it becomes easier

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.465 align:middle line:84%
to let the old system break down
and then create a new system.

00:17:16.465 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: New systems beyond that.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.435 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:17:18.435 --> 00:17:19.274 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:17:19.274 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, people might
be in fear of what's going on

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
is really, look, we have to
change our perception of that.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It is our greatest
hope in the world

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
that these Millennials
and the children that

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.856 align:middle line:84%
follow through them will
create a different world

00:17:32.856 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
than the one we're
living in right now.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That will come as a
relief to a lot of people who

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
are out of jobs,
that are looking

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:84%
for jobs out of college,
can't find them,

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:84%
or in a place where
they are trying

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
to create their own thing and
validate the fact that possibly

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.739 align:middle line:84%
being an entrepreneur at this
day and age is a good thing.

00:17:48.739 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.238 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so exciting is
we're on the edge of something

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
so brand new and exciting,
it's not the old path.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And so this offers a
whole new way of life.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
wonderful that I

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
see about it is that it really
represents an opportunity

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:90%
to create community again.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We have lost community and
people are acting individually,

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and this is actually stemming
from a Darwinian belief

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that we bought into our
culture that our world is based

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:90%
on the survival of the fittest.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:90%
Nature doesn't see that at all.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Nature really says it's not the
individuals that I care about.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Nature wants to
know, look, what's

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:90%
the human population doing?

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell me about
Mozart and don't tell me

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.339 align:middle line:84%
about Einstein or Davinci,
those are wonderful individuals.

00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the individuals
nature is concerned about.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It's the mass of people.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:90%
What are we as a group doing?

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, well,
we're destroying the planet.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.084 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing it under a
cultural belief that says,

00:18:42.084 --> 00:18:43.625 align:middle line:84%
well, there's a
struggle for survival

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and we must go out there and
fight each other for fitness.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the issue is
evolution really

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.455 align:middle line:84%
isn't based on a
struggle for survival.

00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:54.163 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Struggle for
survival any longer.

00:18:54.163 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, it isn't.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's a
cooperative event.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And how do you get cooperation?

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:84%
People have to come back
together in a community.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.649 align:middle line:84%
When we were looking at
us individualistically,

00:19:02.649 --> 00:19:05.023 align:middle line:84%
then I say, well, I don't care
I'm part of the community.

00:19:05.023 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make myself
the fittest, the survival

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.820 align:middle line:84%
of the fittest, so I don't
care about the community.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:90%
The new evolution says, no.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the community that
provides for the evolution, not

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%
the individual.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I get
very enthusiastic to see

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
the young people
out in the streets,

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.770 align:middle line:84%
the young people saying
there's a better way,

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.034 align:middle line:90%
rejecting the system, because--

00:19:25.034 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're right.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: They're right.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:28.412 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we're now going.

00:19:28.412 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these
are some old myths

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.439 align:middle line:84%
that you're breaking down,
these are some old ways

00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that
you're breaking down

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring about
the new ways of thinking.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:36.804 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:19:36.804 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's very interesting
because a civilization

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:90%
is based on a set of beliefs.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And the beliefs are beliefs
related to the answers

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to three fundamental
questions that

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:84%
have been around for 10,000
years, the same questions

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:90%
10,000 years, OK?

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:84%
These questions are called
the Perennial Questions.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:84%
The Perennial Questions
are how did we get here,

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:84%
why are we here, and
now that we're here,

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:90%
how do we make the best of it.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.866 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, a very
interesting aspect about that

00:20:03.866 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:90%
is simply this.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Whoever provides the
answers to the questions

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that the public accepts,
two fundamental consequences

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.430 align:middle line:90%
of that answer.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the answers
give shape to the culture.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And so basically
it says, if this

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:84%
is what we believe
how life is to work,

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:84%
then the culture will build
itself to that belief.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It shapes how the
culture is formed, OK.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So basically the
answers to the questions shape

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:90%
the culture.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.238 align:middle line:84%
These are the
fundamental questions

00:20:32.238 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and they are the
fundamental answers

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that shape the world
that we live in.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And number two, whoever
provides us with those answers

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
also becomes what
we call the truth

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:90%
provider for that civilization.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So questions other than
how did we get here

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and why are we here,
all the other questions

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.070 align:middle line:84%
are also directed
to these people.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.455 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back, let's say
the previous civilization

00:20:52.455 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:90%
is Monotheism, OK?

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.805 align:middle line:84%
And in Monotheism
I say, well, how

00:20:56.805 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:84%
did you answer the questions
and who gave us the answers?

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answers
came from the church.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And the question
was how did we get here,

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and the answer was
divine intervention.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
The Sistine Chapel,
David and God

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
with the little
fingers like that.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
why are we here?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to the church,
the spiritual world isn't here.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual world
is off planet.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Outside of us, yes.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.686 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And so what
are we doing here?

00:21:19.686 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is we're
testing ourselves.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.235 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing if we're
worthy enough to-

00:21:24.235 --> 00:21:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To get there.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -go to
the other place.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So then it says, then
your life on this planet

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
is to live out
plays of morality,

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.890 align:middle line:84%
meaning is your life worthy
enough to go to the next place?

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And they say, well,
how do you make the best of it?

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:90%
How can you do that?

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
church, is just follow

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:90%
the laws of the Bible.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So then they tell us these
are the rules of the Bible.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Once we bought those
answers and the civilization

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
called Monotheism was created
from a previous civilization,

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Polytheism, the church not
only provided those answers,

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.520 align:middle line:84%
but the church was the
source of our truth.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.894 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it
provided-- it made

00:21:56.894 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
us believe that our answers
are outside of ourselves.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.014 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And it separated us from
our spiritual connection.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So it sort of said,
look, we're the interface

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.847 align:middle line:90%
between you and God.

00:22:06.847 --> 00:22:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
want to go with God,

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.055 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
really walk through us

00:22:10.055 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and we'll guide you
there and help you there,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you could
pay for your way there.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it'll cost you.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Exactly.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of an
interesting club,

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
because they also
made a club out of it.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:84%
You're either part of our
organization or your dead.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.084 align:middle line:90%
And so, it's like, OK.

00:22:25.084 --> 00:22:25.875 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.279 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And that really
put everybody together

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and we then sought answers
to everything about life

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:84%
from the guys wearing the
black frocks, the priests.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was the shaping
of that civilization.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:84%
At least there was a morality,
even if it wasn't operating

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:84%
that way, there was
a morality behind it.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But the concepts change when
the answer to the first question

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.384 align:middle line:84%
The first question was
how did we get here?

00:22:50.384 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Church gave us
the whole story of Genesis,

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the seven days of magic,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Adam and Eve, yes.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:84%
In about 1870, about 10 years
after Charles Darwin's "Origin

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:84%
of Species" book,
civilization changed

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.970 align:middle line:84%
because they accepted
a different answer.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And this new
civilization is what

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
we call Scientific
Materialism, OK?

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So in Scientific Materialism,
I say, well, science took over.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.945 align:middle line:84%
What answers to the
questions did they provide?

00:23:18.945 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So the first question
is how did we get here?

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Darwinian
idea was oh, we

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
got here through random
genetic mutations.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:84%
It was just these
accidental mutations

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:90%
that ultimately led to us.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:90%
And we say, oh, OK, cool.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Which really has great
influence on the second question

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:90%
of why are we here?

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a trouble spot because
according to a random mutation

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.382 align:middle line:90%
consequence, why are we here?

00:23:39.382 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, I
don't know why we're here,

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
it was just an accident.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
humans had lost

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:84%
a real purpose in
their existence.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we're here.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, genetics.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Accident, we don't know why.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the worst part of
the Scientific Materialism

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:90%
comes in the third question.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:84%
The third question, well, how
do you make the best of it?

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the
foundational insight

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:84%
to the Theory of
Evolution is that we

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:84%
are facing a
struggle for survival

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:90%
in our effort to exist.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And that built in the concept
of the survival of the fittest

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and said, this is
a jungle out here.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And how do you make
the best of it?

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You live by the
laws of the jungle.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Now what's really interesting,
well, the previous generation,

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Monotheism, at least had a
moral aspect of your life

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
should be something like
morally appropriate.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.545 align:middle line:84%
When it came to science,
science didn't offer morality.

00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't its job to do that.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.389 align:middle line:84%
Science's job is to
say how does it work?

00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And so science says,
look, it's based

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.221 align:middle line:90%
on the survival of the fittest.

00:24:41.221 --> 00:24:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the question is
that's the end, survival.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.499 align:middle line:84%
What is the means
to get to that end?

00:24:47.499 --> 00:24:49.082 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where
science says, look,

00:24:49.082 --> 00:24:50.456 align:middle line:84%
it's not my job
to tell you that.

00:24:50.456 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're the last one
standing, then you win, OK?

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is the means
to get to the end,

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
you know like with Albert
Einstein or Mozart.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we're looking for
as a survival of the fittest?

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
that could work,

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
but some jerk with an AK-47
could also be the last one.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
you say, oh, my god.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.114 align:middle line:84%
We can do anything
it takes to succeed.

00:25:15.114 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the world around us

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:84%
you start to see, oh, my God,
people are ripping each other

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
off, people are
dominating each other.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.644 align:middle line:84%
And they do it not like
in a hostile manner,

00:25:25.644 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
they do it because they say
look at what the science said.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I need to survive.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.125 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And I can do
anything to survive.

00:25:31.125 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
when we bought the questions

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:84%
from science, we also made
science a truth provider.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And science went
up against Monotheism

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.853 align:middle line:90%
in a competitive--

00:25:39.853 --> 00:25:40.196 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:25:40.196 --> 00:25:40.737 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: -way.

00:25:40.737 --> 00:25:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And so no
longer do the people

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:84%
in today's civilization go
to the black-coated priests

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.889 align:middle line:84%
for their truths, we go to the
white-coated priests called

00:25:49.889 --> 00:25:50.555 align:middle line:90%
the scientists--

00:25:50.555 --> 00:25:51.346 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting

00:25:51.346 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -who offer
us their answers.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So now this is OK-- if
the beliefs of science

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
are accurate, then following
their suggestions is

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.210 align:middle line:90%
going to be great.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But if the beliefs are not
accurate, at that point

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:84%
then it says those beliefs
could lead us to a termination.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.244 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:26:11.244 --> 00:26:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The extinction we've
been talking about.

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the
Darwinian philosophies

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about,
the survival of the fittest,

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.129 align:middle line:84%
are the old science in
what your opinion is.

00:26:20.129 --> 00:26:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's destructive
science because that's

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
what we're living by, that's our
cultural way of life right now.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It says, look, if I
happen to beat you

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the
ground, well, that's OK

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.219 align:middle line:84%
because that's
the law of nature.

00:26:33.219 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to beat you in
survival of the fittest.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And so you might
say, well, then OK,

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:84%
if we're facing our extinction
because of this issue

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:84%
about our beliefs
not being correct,

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:90%
what should we do about it?

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And I love it because
Albert Einstein,

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:84%
he's one of my great
heroes of course.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein came
up with a very simple

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.510 align:middle line:90%
often-repeated phrase.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.510 align:middle line:84%
People have heard it a lot,
but to me it's most important

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
at this moment and that is you
cannot solve the problems with

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
the same thinking that
created the problems.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:90%
The issue is this.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:84%
The institutions that we live
by-- science, government,

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
academia, et cetera--
have provided us

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
with belief systems, and we have
been following these beliefs.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.382 align:middle line:84%
And in following these beliefs,
now we face our own extinction.

00:27:18.382 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.880 align:middle line:84%
The point is we have
to change the path.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's why so-- you know,
so people should recognize when

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.900 align:middle line:84%
you see the institutions having
trouble, this is not bad.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's
the beliefs provided

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:32.864 align:middle line:90%
by those institutions--

00:27:32.864 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's those old
beliefs, those old systems that

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
are breaking down, which is
what we're experience, right?

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Right, so when
you see it falling down,

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:84%
you could look at it two
ways and go oh, my god, it's

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.316 align:middle line:90%
the end of the system.

00:27:42.316 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:90%
And I go yeah, great.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if it doesn't end,
extinction is the result.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So stand back and look at
it and say, yes, it's time

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
to change the beliefs
to live in a greater

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
harmony with the world than
with each other because we

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
are, indeed, facing
this evolution.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.940 align:middle line:84%
It is very exciting to be
alive now for this reason.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:84%
We are actually witnessing the
evolution of human civilization

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.480 align:middle line:90%
to the next higher level.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.415 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we look
at human civilization

00:28:08.415 --> 00:28:10.849 align:middle line:84%
as individuals
competing and trying

00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:90%
to survive in this world.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.473 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:28:12.473 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The
evolution we're facing

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.474 align:middle line:84%
is not we're going to evolve and
change who we are biologically.

00:28:17.474 --> 00:28:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're not
going to expire.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.370 align:middle line:90%
We're--

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: No.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:20.229 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:20.229 --> 00:28:21.776 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What we
knew is expiring.

00:28:21.776 --> 00:28:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Well, yeah.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:84%
The way we organize
is going to change.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:90%
What we're realizing is this.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn, and
we're learning it right now,

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.260 align:middle line:84%
humans are not
separate entities.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Humans collectively
are a super organism.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Each human is like a cell in
the body of a super organism

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:90%
called humanity.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes important
because it says every human,

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't care where
they are on the planet,

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:90%
are part of the same humanity.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.019 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
a living system,

00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:84%
let's say a human body, in
which the cells are fighting

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:84%
each other, that's
a disease called

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune disease,
which a lot of people

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.664 align:middle line:84%
are affected by because what's
going on in the outer world

00:28:58.664 --> 00:29:00.455 align:middle line:84%
is also being reflected
in the inner world.

00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So the increase
in autoimmune disease,

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
which in Latin simply
means self-destruction,

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
we are facing that on
the planet now where

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
people have been fighting each
other and killing each other

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's reflective of
what's going on in our world--

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -what's going
on in our bodies.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Our biology
is a complement

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.460 align:middle line:84%
to the world in
which we live, so

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're beginning
to see a change.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And especially the Millennials
are very critical aspects

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:84%
of this new evolution
for a simple reason.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.610 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system
of this new structure

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.720 align:middle line:84%
called humanity is
called the internet.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It's what connects 7 billion
cells into one system.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And what I so
appreciate about it

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is when I travel
around the world

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and I see other people
and young people

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.511 align:middle line:84%
in all these other worlds, what
I start to realize-- it's like

00:29:48.511 --> 00:29:50.135 align:middle line:84%
if I'm in Russia--
when I was in Russia

00:29:50.135 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and I look at the
young people and I go,

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.230 align:middle line:84%
well, it's hard to
tell the difference

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.550 align:middle line:84%
between these young
people in Russia

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and the young people in
Santa Cruz, California.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:90%
And I start to recognize, yes.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning to recognize,
the younger people, they're

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.330 align:middle line:84%
not part of this warring,
violent structure that

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.500 align:middle line:84%
has preceded in our
history right now.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.540 align:middle line:84%
They, themselves, are
beginning to recognize--

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:84%
they're the ones that are
recognizing that humans

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:90%
are the same all over the place.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole Arab Spring
was internet generated.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.902 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all-- it's
creating its entire own culture,

00:30:21.902 --> 00:30:22.735 align:middle line:90%
its own environment.

00:30:22.735 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Exactly.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's so interesting.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.469 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:30:25.469 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So now these old myths
that are being broken down,

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.960 align:middle line:90%
what are the new structures?

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.760 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, I
refer to what are

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:84%
called the four myths
of the apocalypse.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by this is these
are for beliefs that we bought

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
from science that if we continue
following these beliefs,

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
then we will inevitably see
the apocalypse that science is

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:90%
suggesting is in our future, OK?

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And what's interesting
is these four beliefs science

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.441 align:middle line:84%
provided for us during the
last couple hundred years,

00:30:56.441 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and we have shaped our culture
based on these beliefs.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And now it turns out
that these beliefs

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:90%
are flawed or outright wrong.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
is by following them,

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that's why we're
facing our destruction.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.740 align:middle line:90%
So let's just list the four.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.165 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What are they?

00:31:08.165 --> 00:31:08.665 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:31:08.665 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The first belief
is that biology, or our life

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:84%
sciences, are run by
Newtonian physics.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And you go, so what
does that mean?

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, the significance
of Newtonian physics

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a physics that
emphasizes the material

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
universe and ignores
the invisible world.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
It says everything that's
physical is real, count on it,

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's what it's all about.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But the invisible
stuff, not too relevant.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.143 align:middle line:90%
And the invisible stuff is what?

00:31:32.143 --> 00:31:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, spirit,
emotions, all these things.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.507 align:middle line:90%
It's like no, no.

00:31:36.507 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the physical
body, look at the cells,

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:39.506 align:middle line:90%
look at the chemistry.

00:31:39.506 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is the way science
looks at human health,

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:84%
just like the
physical nature of it.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.190 align:middle line:90%
And we say, what about the mind?

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And they go, mind's
not relevant.

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.910 align:middle line:84%
It's your chemistry
and your genes.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.326 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you
go to the doctor,

00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:54.120 align:middle line:84%
they give you the physical
reading and diagnosis and then

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.954 align:middle line:84%
a medication and that's
what you get, right?

00:31:55.954 --> 00:31:56.619 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Right.

00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is
there's a new science.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually not that
new, it's almost 100 years old.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.794 align:middle line:90%
And it's called quantum physics.

00:32:02.794 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:90%
And what's the significance?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics
completely turns the table

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:84%
on Newtonian physics
for this reason.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.470 align:middle line:84%
It says, the primary controlling
influence in this universe

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:84%
are the invisible
forces, the energy.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:19.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy that
shapes the material world.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's like
collectively, we talk

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.180 align:middle line:90%
about all the energy in physics.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.950 align:middle line:90%
We call it the field.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Lynne McTaggart has a
great book on "The Field."

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.698 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:32:27.698 --> 00:32:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And we say,
well, what's the field?

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Well it's the invisible
forces that are around us.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And I say well, what does
quantum physics say about this?

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:39.600 align:middle line:84%
It says look, the field is
the soul governing agency

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:90%
of matter.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a quote from
Albert Einstein.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And what does it mean?

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
The soul governing agency
of the physical realm

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:84%
is not the physical realm
but the invisible energy.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.796 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's outside
of the physical realm.

00:32:52.796 --> 00:32:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the physical
realm turns out to be energy

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:90%
as well, so that's--

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Same thing.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- I see.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: You see, when
we took the atom apart--

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's
seen this in school.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.430 align:middle line:84%
The atom looks like a little
solar system, marbles,

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.439 align:middle line:84%
ball bearings moving
around, stuff like that.

00:33:06.439 --> 00:33:08.730 align:middle line:84%
When they went inside to look
at those things, protons,

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:84%
electrons, neutrons, they said,
well what are they made out of?

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.389 align:middle line:84%
That's where the big
surprise came from.

00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they said,
what's a proton made of?

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.327 align:middle line:84%
It's like when they
looked inside, energy.

00:33:17.327 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Electron, what's it made out of?

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Energy.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, what
we perceive as physical

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.381 align:middle line:90%
is just another form of energy.

00:33:23.381 --> 00:33:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And that energy of
the physical body

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.910 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
energy of the field.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So as the energy of
the field changes,

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.590 align:middle line:84%
it changes the energy
of our physical body.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the field is
considered the soul governing

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:84%
agency of that particle
or material world.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's basically
really all interconnected.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Oh, that's
the whole idea.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.320 align:middle line:90%
There is no separation.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
because if you

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
ask me, well, give a
definition of the field.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, the field
represents invisible moving

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.370 align:middle line:84%
forces that shape
the physical world.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, wow,
isn't that interesting.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.777 align:middle line:90%
There was a word spirit.

00:33:57.777 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's the
definition of spirit?

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Invisible moving forces that
influence the physical world.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what's
really coming about

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:84%
is a cycle that's
being completed.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.929 align:middle line:84%
We started off with an
awareness of spirituality,

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:12.600 align:middle line:84%
but not really an
understanding of it,

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.440 align:middle line:84%
but there was like that
mysterious invisible.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.150 align:middle line:84%
We went through a
whole history and what

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.110 align:middle line:84%
does quantum physics
return us to?

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
It's, yes, there
is the equivalent

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:84%
of that invisible
spiritual energy

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and we also now
understand the mechanics.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a sudden, it
becomes scientific spirituality

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:31.400 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.017 align:middle line:84%
It's like not mystical,
but it's part of our world.

00:34:34.017 --> 00:34:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.829 align:middle line:84%
That's how the gap has been
bridged by what your work is.

00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, you mentioned
a few other myths.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.639 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said
that there was four.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And the second
one is very critical.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is that we've all

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:47.560 align:middle line:84%
been programmed with the belief
that genes control our lives.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: I say, well,
why is that relevant?

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
as far as we know,

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:84%
we didn't pick the
genes we came with.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.575 align:middle line:84%
The genes that we have, if we
don't like the physical traits

00:34:55.575 --> 00:34:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that they provide,
then we say, well, I

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.325 align:middle line:90%
can't do anything about it.

00:34:58.325 --> 00:34:59.454 align:middle line:90%
I can't change the genes.

00:34:59.454 --> 00:35:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden you start to
realize, you say wait a minute.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Genes control my life and
as science tried to show us

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:84%
it controls behavior, emotions,
and physical characteristics.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize but
you don't control the genes.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden,
we've been put back

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.610 align:middle line:84%
just like in the
previous civilization.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Monotheism says, look, you
don't-- are not connected

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:90%
to spirit.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're not
connected to your genes.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.139 align:middle line:90%
You can't change your genes.

00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, then all of a sudden,
it says, oh, my gosh.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm a victim of my heredity.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.834 align:middle line:84%
If there's cancer or diabetes
running in my family--

00:35:30.834 --> 00:35:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm going to get it.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: -I'm going to get it.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.668 align:middle line:90%
What can I do about it?

00:35:33.668 --> 00:35:35.597 align:middle line:84%
Well, just like in the
previous civilization

00:35:35.597 --> 00:35:37.180 align:middle line:84%
when you find yourself
being a victim,

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.840 align:middle line:90%
then you seek a rescuer.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So we go out there and
we look at the field

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:84%
of allopathic medicine and say
look, I'm a victim of my genes.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.690 align:middle line:84%
What can you do to
help me overcome

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the consequence of my genes and
what's running in my family?

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:53.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, new science.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Genes-- yes, go ahead.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's so interesting,
it's the first thing that you

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.139 align:middle line:84%
write down when you go
into a doctor's office is

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:01.355 align:middle line:84%
your genetic history, as if
it is a blueprint for you.

00:36:01.355 --> 00:36:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is the biggest error
because since we believe

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.010 align:middle line:84%
that that family lineage is
what's passing on the trait

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and we believe that all traits
are controlled by genes, then

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.820 align:middle line:84%
we don't really care
about the psychology

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:84%
or what was going
on in the culture.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:90%
That's irrelevant.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.020 align:middle line:90%
You are genes.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.262 align:middle line:84%
You're manifesting
gene expression.

00:36:20.262 --> 00:36:22.220 align:middle line:84%
That takes you out of
the picture again, right?

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But now we're beginning to
know a whole new understanding.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole new science.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Genetics, the
belief of genetics--

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:84%
let's just make a
simple flat statement.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.624 align:middle line:90%
Genes control nothing.

00:36:34.624 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:90%
They don't control anything.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Genes-- and we heard in
school and we all-- you go out

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and talk to the average
person on the street.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That breaks every
single belief system out there.

00:36:41.805 --> 00:36:44.172 align:middle line:84%
It breaks all scientific
facts right now.

00:36:44.172 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
and it's profoundly

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.879 align:middle line:90%
important for a simple reason.

00:36:46.879 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if genes did control it
and we didn't pick the genes,

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
then by definition
we're out of control.

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And so significantly,
there's a new science.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And let's just go
back for a sample

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
because how many times
have-- people talk every day.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Oh, a gene turned on,
a gene turned off,

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.000 align:middle line:90%
a gene caused cancer.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
those statements

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:12.210 align:middle line:84%
are completely
false for a reason.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Genes are blueprints.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They're blueprints to make
the physical proteins that

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:90%
give us our body.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, yes they are
connected to our expression,

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
but do they control
the expression?

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Genes have no on and
genes have no off.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:90%
They're blueprints.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.465 align:middle line:84%
I love to put it in regard to,
look, if genes are blueprints,

00:37:31.465 --> 00:37:33.340 align:middle line:84%
think about it going to
an architect's office

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and she's working
on a blueprint.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.593 align:middle line:84%
And you look over
her shoulder and you

00:37:36.593 --> 00:37:38.477 align:middle line:90%
say is your blueprint on or off?

00:37:38.477 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And she'd looked at you
like, what are you, crazy?

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.520 align:middle line:90%
There's no on and off.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And I go, precisely.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Genes are blueprints, but
they have no on, no off.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
idea what's going

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:90%
on in the world around them.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.160 align:middle line:90%
They're just blueprints.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.010 align:middle line:84%
We've been focusing on the
genes as being self-actualizing.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.570 align:middle line:90%
A gene makes a decision.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, absolutely
totally false.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.750 align:middle line:90%
A gene is a blueprint.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So a gene
cannot-- if someone, say,

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.770 align:middle line:84%
has a cancer gene, it doesn't
automatically turn itself

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:10.719 align:middle line:84%
on and express itself
as being cancer?

00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: No.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.550 align:middle line:84%
The concept of a cancer
gene is totally misleading,

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:84%
because if I said I had a
gene that causes cancer,

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.610 align:middle line:84%
then if I had that gene then
anybody who has that gene

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:19.594 align:middle line:90%
should have cancer.

00:38:19.594 --> 00:38:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, I
have a cancer gene,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and 67% of the
people have cancer.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And I go, yeah, really cool.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.794 align:middle line:84%
What about the 33% that
have the gene and they

00:38:27.794 --> 00:38:28.710 align:middle line:90%
don't have the cancer?

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.452 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:38:29.452 --> 00:38:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it's like, oh,

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.130 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to
talk about that.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well I don't care
if you want to talk about it

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:33.900 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
They have the gene, they
don't have the cancer.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You tell me why.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.487 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the new biology.

00:38:38.487 --> 00:38:40.320 align:middle line:84%
The new biology is not
asking about the ones

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:40.895 align:middle line:90%
that have the cancer.

00:38:40.895 --> 00:38:42.616 align:middle line:84%
It really wants to know
how can you have the gene

00:38:42.616 --> 00:38:43.820 align:middle line:90%
and not have the cancer?

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out
genes are blueprints,

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.970 align:middle line:84%
but there's a contractor in
the body, a contractor that

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:84%
selects the blueprints
and can modify

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.080 align:middle line:84%
the blueprints by their
response to the environment.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.330 align:middle line:84%
You adjust your genetics by how
you respond to the environment.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Is nature's intelligence.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:07.040 align:middle line:84%
If my genes were prefixed
and the environment changed

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and my genes didn't fit,
then the whole species

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.740 align:middle line:90%
would die out.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
what epigenetics is.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:13.056 align:middle line:90%
Epigenetics is--

00:39:13.056 --> 00:39:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The new
science, epigenetics.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.207 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
the original science

00:39:17.207 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that almost everybody
out there in the world

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:84%
has learned, it's call
genetics or genetic control,

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.280 align:middle line:90%
which means control by genes.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.230 align:middle line:84%
The new science almost
sounds the same.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It's called epigenetics
or epigenetic control.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:84%
What you have to catch
is that little epi part.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Epi means above.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So we say the word
for skin is epidermis.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I say, what is epidermis?

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Dermis is the layer
below the skin.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Epidermis is the layer
above the dermis, the skin.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.548 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: So epi means above.

00:39:46.548 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So I say, what is
epigenetic control mean?

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:52.040 align:middle line:90%
I go, control above the genes.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And now we start
to recognize how

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:59.510 align:middle line:84%
the environment and our
perception of the environment

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:84%
are responsible, not
for just selecting

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.720 align:middle line:84%
the genes-- this fact I'm
going to say right now

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.410 align:middle line:90%
is mind blowing.

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:84%
How we perceive or
respond to the environment

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:84%
can take every gene
blueprint that we have

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and create thousands of
variations of proteins

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.040 align:middle line:90%
from the same blueprint.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it
completely can change

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.700 align:middle line:84%
based on the environment,
and the environment

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.830 align:middle line:84%
being your upbringing,
your thoughts, your health,

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.580 align:middle line:84%
your food, all of that
is the environment.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: All of
that is part of it.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is so empowering
for a very simple reason.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:33.949 align:middle line:84%
Genetic control,
I'm a victim, why?

00:40:33.949 --> 00:40:35.615 align:middle line:84%
I didn't pick them,
I can't change them,

00:40:35.615 --> 00:40:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm stuck with them.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Epigenetics says, no.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.950 align:middle line:84%
If you change the way
you respond to the world,

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.740 align:middle line:90%
you change your genetic readout.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:90%
So, give you an example.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Only 10% of cancer
is heredity based.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:53.110 align:middle line:84%
90% of cancer are people
responding inappropriately

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:55.160 align:middle line:84%
to the environment
and then creating

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:84%
a variation on their genes
that leads to the cancer.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.100 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have an
inherent cancer gene.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.701 align:middle line:84%
They modified the
readout of their genes.

00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, then
there's the flip side.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And the flip side is somebody
who has a terminal cancer

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:12.020 align:middle line:84%
but changes their
perception or response

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to the world around
them, and then

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.660 align:middle line:84%
has what we call a
spontaneous remission.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's not a miracle.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just the fact
that you have changed

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.600 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between
your perception and the genes

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.855 align:middle line:90%
and you can rewrite the genes.

00:41:24.855 --> 00:41:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're going
to speak specifically

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.460 align:middle line:84%
about what that has
to do with stress,

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and how you can change
your response to stress

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and your perception
of stress and not

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.237 align:middle line:84%
activate the genetic
marker for cancer.

00:41:37.237 --> 00:41:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: That's the whole idea.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:84%
We are so empowered,
and yet, we've

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.470 align:middle line:84%
been programmed to believe
that we're victims.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And since perception
controls, if you

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:48.326 align:middle line:84%
perceive you are a
victim, that perception

00:41:48.326 --> 00:41:50.704 align:middle line:90%
will manifest as expression.

00:41:50.704 --> 00:41:52.370 align:middle line:84%
There is a simple
quote from Henry Ford.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:55.730 align:middle line:84%
He says, if you
believe you can or you

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.780 align:middle line:90%
believe you can't, you're right.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.845 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have a
shirt with that, yes.

00:41:59.845 --> 00:42:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.567 align:middle line:84%
So there's just two
more beliefs and then

00:42:02.567 --> 00:42:03.775 align:middle line:90%
we can go through these four.

00:42:03.775 --> 00:42:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, go ahead.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The third belief is the belief
that the world is really

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.060 align:middle line:84%
a Darwinian world
and that we're here

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:84%
on a competition for fitness
and survival in that world.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out the
evolution of the planet

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:90%
is not a competition.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.866 align:middle line:84%
We referred once to that
there was a garden here.

00:42:22.866 --> 00:42:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand
the nature of a garden,

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
a garden is not an
expression of competition.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.880 align:middle line:84%
A garden is an expression
of total cooperation.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the reality is what
happened to the garden?

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.990 align:middle line:84%
The answer is once
we put in competition

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:37.370 align:middle line:90%
instead of cooperation--

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Our pesticides and--

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: -and everything.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We destroy them because
we're going to say, look,

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.240 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to
cooperate with you.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
We want you to do what
we want you to do.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So human domination of nature
has been the whole concept

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:50.450 align:middle line:84%
that science could
dominate nature.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no,
I don't think so.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The reality is our
meddling with nature

00:42:56.090 --> 00:43:01.080 align:middle line:84%
is actually responsible for the
looming extinction right now.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.970 align:middle line:90%
So there's a new understanding.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:06.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not the survival
of the fittest.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I created a new
word, fittingest.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a survival
of the fittingest,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.790 align:middle line:84%
meaning those organisms that
cooperate with the garden are

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.640 align:middle line:84%
going to be encouraged
by the garden

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:84%
to maintain its
existence on the planet.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Those organisms
that are actually

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:23.240 align:middle line:84%
competing with the
garden or interfering

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.060 align:middle line:84%
with the garden,
nature will tend

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate those
organisms over time.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.925 align:middle line:90%
They will go extinct.

00:43:27.925 --> 00:43:29.591 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
human civilization,

00:43:29.591 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and you go, yeah,
nature's not really

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:33.175 align:middle line:84%
pretty happy with
the destruction

00:43:33.175 --> 00:43:34.050 align:middle line:90%
that we have wrought.

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're sort of like fleas on
the back of nature right now,

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and she's trying
to shake us off.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.865 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is either we
learn to work with her--

00:43:41.865 --> 00:43:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In cooperation, yes.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -or nature's going
to be here, we'll just be gone.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned that
there were four myths.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.667 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:43:49.667 --> 00:43:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And we have one more left.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And the fourth
one is the concept

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:84%
that evolution is
a random process.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the belief
in Darwinian theory

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that the mutations that
kick everything off

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:03.450 align:middle line:84%
are called random mutations,
genetic accidents.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The significance of
that is if we got here

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.980 align:middle line:84%
through random mutations, you
might say then why are we here?

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I have to say,
it was just an accident.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It was just shaking
genetic dice.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.480 align:middle line:84%
If a mutation would have
gone left instead of right

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.740 align:middle line:84%
a million years ago, maybe
we wouldn't be here today.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the belief.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.980 align:middle line:84%
The new belief
reveals, no, it's not

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:24.649 align:middle line:84%
random mutations that really
provided for our existence,

00:44:24.649 --> 00:44:25.440 align:middle line:90%
it's something new.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.700 align:middle line:84%
It's called an
adaptive mutation.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And what it really
means is this,

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.400 align:middle line:84%
is that we and every
other organism that

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.470 align:middle line:84%
is in this environment got
here as part of an effort

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.376 align:middle line:84%
to adapt and conform and
support the environment,

00:44:41.376 --> 00:44:42.500 align:middle line:90%
the garden in that we live.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.375 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain that.

00:44:43.375 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So it basically
says when an organism comes

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.940 align:middle line:84%
into an environment,
it has a tendency

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.060 align:middle line:90%
to alter the environment.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:90%
It's going to eat.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.020 align:middle line:84%
It's going to leave
waste materials behind.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It's going to alter
the environment.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea if I bring in
an organism to create harmony

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and then at some point
it gets out of balance,

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:84%
nature introduces
another organism

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that will then try to
rebalance it again.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And so a new organism
comes in to compensate

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.850 align:middle line:84%
for the previous organism,
but then ultimately this one

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:16.090 align:middle line:84%
may throw it out of balance so
another organism is introduced.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.710 align:middle line:84%
You keep adding organisms to
create harmony and balance.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
add an organism,

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.810 align:middle line:84%
it has more power and
influence in creating

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:23.852 align:middle line:90%
harmony and balance.

00:45:23.852 --> 00:45:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And you say, OK,
what about humans?

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.054 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're near the top
of this one after the other

00:45:28.054 --> 00:45:28.720 align:middle line:90%
after the other.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And being near the top,
we have so much power

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.150 align:middle line:84%
in altering or
influencing environment

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.270 align:middle line:84%
that without knowledge
of our effort of trying

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to keep harmony in the garden,
the same powers that we have,

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.730 align:middle line:84%
have led to the current state
of destroying the garden.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:47.527 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
the fact is no, no.

00:45:47.527 --> 00:45:49.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize we
didn't get here by action,

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.840 align:middle line:84%
we actually have a job and
that is to tend the garden.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting--

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To get ourselves
out of it, yes.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The new
civilization ultimately

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:01.190 align:middle line:84%
comes back in a circle back
to the original animus, who

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:05.100 align:middle line:84%
were spiritual and material,
and also as the Native Americans

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.460 align:middle line:84%
said, we are here
to tend the garden,

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.150 align:middle line:90%
and we've lost that mission.

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, the
looming extinction

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is an expression of
we're out of balance.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we are
here now to tend

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:84%
our own environmental garden of
our thoughts, our surroundings,

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:23.280 align:middle line:84%
our environment in order
to positively impact

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.615 align:middle line:90%
our own genes, right?

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Old hippie statement, before
you go out and change the world,

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:29.730 align:middle line:90%
take care of your backyard.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we
come back, basically--

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:33.802 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Old hippie statement.

00:46:33.802 --> 00:46:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Very profound.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.596 align:middle line:90%
Old hippie statement.

00:46:37.596 --> 00:46:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: We're going
to come back and learn

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.250 align:middle line:84%
that before we can go out there
and evolve with the world,

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.190 align:middle line:84%
we first have to
recognize who we are

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and evolve ourselves
so that we become

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.961 align:middle line:84%
a contributing element
to a future civilization.

00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.876 align:middle line:84%
And this is really-- we're
going to cover the how on this,

00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:54.635 align:middle line:84%
exactly how the cells do
respond to the environment.

00:46:54.635 --> 00:46:56.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see that
through Petri dish slides.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.726 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I meant by
this information could radically

00:46:59.726 --> 00:47:01.350 align:middle line:84%
change the way that
you live your life.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.550 align:middle line:84%
When you really
truly see the impact

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.490 align:middle line:84%
of your thoughts and
positive thoughts

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and our perception
of those thoughts

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
on the growth of
the cell, you'll

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.737 align:middle line:84%
understand what it means to
have those positive thoughts.

00:47:12.737 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:14.420 align:middle line:90%
This is Lisa Garr.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:22.465 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Welcome back.

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.700 align:middle line:84%
My guess is cellular
biologist Dr. Bruce Lipton,

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about how our
environment affects our cells.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But first, I need to ask
you how did your environment

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.700 align:middle line:90%
affect your work?

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where did you
start with all this passion

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that you have around
epigenetics in your work

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:43.464 align:middle line:90%
as a cellular biologist?

00:47:43.464 --> 00:47:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
interestingly enough, it

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:46.710 align:middle line:84%
started when I was
in second grade,

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:49.560 align:middle line:90%
so it was a real early kick.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And basically what happened
was in second grade,

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.885 align:middle line:84%
I remember a science teacher
brought in a microscope

00:47:54.885 --> 00:47:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
first time any of us

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.080 align:middle line:90%
kids really saw a microscope.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And inside that microscope
was a slide with amoebas

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and paramecium and
stuff like that.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, you got to realize,
as second graders

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.603 align:middle line:84%
we're just little kids and
everything in the world

00:48:09.603 --> 00:48:10.720 align:middle line:90%
is so big around us.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.382 align:middle line:84%
And when I had my
chance to stand up

00:48:12.382 --> 00:48:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and I looked in that microscope
and I put my eye down there

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and I finally saw
it, I said [GASPS].

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It was like these little things
were moving around in there

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:21.149 align:middle line:84%
and there was this
little world that

00:48:21.149 --> 00:48:23.050 align:middle line:84%
was so small you
couldn't even see it.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And so now I'm a
big guy and those

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.980 align:middle line:90%
are these little tiny things.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.596 align:middle line:84%
And even in the
mind of my childhood

00:48:30.596 --> 00:48:32.470 align:middle line:84%
at that moment, when I
looked at these cells,

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I realized they weren't
like a pinball bouncing all

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.470 align:middle line:90%
over the place just randomly.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.180 align:middle line:84%
They moved over here and
looked at something apparently,

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and then moved back and
they looked over here.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they bumped
into each other.

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.500 align:middle line:84%
When they were bumping,
they were communicating.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.965 align:middle line:84%
And in my child
mind I said, my god,

00:48:47.965 --> 00:48:49.090 align:middle line:90%
they're like little people.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:50.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole little
world under there

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're having
this whole thing.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.018 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
interesting because from that

00:48:54.018 --> 00:48:58.020 align:middle line:84%
was the very foundation of my
first look into a microscope.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I went through high
school biology and college

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.650 align:middle line:84%
biology major, and
then graduate school.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:07.635 align:middle line:84%
And ended up being an
electron microscopist.

00:49:07.635 --> 00:49:12.110 align:middle line:84%
An electron microscopist, the
regular lighted microscope

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:12.861 align:middle line:90%
you can see cells.

00:49:12.861 --> 00:49:14.526 align:middle line:84%
In the electron
microscope, you get down

00:49:14.526 --> 00:49:16.540 align:middle line:84%
into the molecules that
are making up the cell.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And it was
the most exciting career

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I could ever imagine
because every day

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.864 align:middle line:84%
when I went to the lab
and turned on the electron

00:49:23.864 --> 00:49:25.530 align:middle line:84%
microscope and started
to look in there,

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.080 align:middle line:84%
it was sort of like the
complete opposite of going out

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:28.960 align:middle line:90%
into deep space.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It was like going
into deep space.

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And I would
see things every day

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that no human had ever
seen in the world before.

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And yet, they
existed inside your body.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Exactly.

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And it was like another world.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And it really brought me back
to the original childhood

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.870 align:middle line:84%
experience that
cells are, indeed,

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:52.020 align:middle line:90%
miniature living people.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And a very interesting fact.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.750 align:middle line:84%
All the functions that we
see in our human body--

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.100 align:middle line:84%
digestive, respiratory
system, excretory, muscle,

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.720 align:middle line:84%
all these things,
even immune system--

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.150 align:middle line:84%
virtually every
single cell organism

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:07.032 align:middle line:90%
has every one of those systems.

00:50:07.032 --> 00:50:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every function?

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Every function.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.080 align:middle line:84%
These cells even have an
immune system, digestive,

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.020 align:middle line:84%
respiratory,
reproductive system.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Cells have a social community.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Cells exchange ideas.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Cells create construction.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's just so interesting
that after all those years

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to come back and find my
god, they are little people.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you
have a relationship

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:26.950 align:middle line:90%
with these little things?

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:28.080 align:middle line:84%
You would go there and
you'd get to see now

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.636 align:middle line:84%
what are you doing today and
how are you communicating?

00:50:30.636 --> 00:50:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: I absolutely did.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And what was so exciting
is because I would

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:84%
put these cells into
a tissue culture--

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I was also doing
cloning stem cells.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And this was really fun because
I was cloning stem cells back

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.140 align:middle line:90%
in 1967.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.209 align:middle line:90%
Now that was like 45 years ago.

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:47.750 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think oh, stem cells.

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:49.230 align:middle line:84%
That's that recent
biology stuff.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:49.813 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:53.637 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's like, well, I was
working on them 45 years ago.

00:50:53.637 --> 00:50:55.970 align:middle line:84%
There were only a handful of
us in the entire world that

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.300 align:middle line:84%
had any idea of stem cells
and I was cloning them.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And what was so neat about
it and this was so cool

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:05.150 align:middle line:84%
because at some point, as I
was doing these experiments

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.390 align:middle line:84%
with stem cells, I was also
teaching medical students

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:09.440 align:middle line:84%
about the nature
of how cells work,

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.122 align:middle line:84%
the conventional understanding
that genes control life

00:51:12.122 --> 00:51:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and biochemistry,
blah, blah, blah.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's your day job?

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: That was a day job.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I would come in
the lab and these cells

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.590 align:middle line:90%
would show me a world.

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I would look at them
and say, oh, my god,

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.770 align:middle line:90%
what are you guys doing?

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
to observe them,

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I was completely blown
away because I started

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to realize what I was
teaching in medical school

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:37.380 align:middle line:84%
was so incorrect in
regard to how cells work

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.290 align:middle line:84%
that, ultimately, I found
that I really couldn't

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:43.840 align:middle line:84%
in good integrity stay and
teach in the medical school.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.390 align:middle line:90%
I had tenure.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of the
university because I realized

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.051 align:middle line:84%
I am teaching totally
incorrect information.

00:51:49.051 --> 00:51:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course when I
walked out the university,

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.930 align:middle line:84%
all my colleagues looked at
me, it's like, you're weird.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's wrong with him.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.773 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: What's wrong with you?

00:51:55.773 --> 00:51:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, that stuff is--
you know, that's artifact.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:51:59.760 align:middle line:90%
That's not real.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Because it so conflicted with
the conventional belief system

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:07.540 align:middle line:84%
that they sort of just ignored
me and sidelined my work.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, I had at
least the fortunate opportunity

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.200 align:middle line:84%
to come back later at Stanford
and redo these experiments

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and then come out with even
more powerful conclusions that

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:22.110 align:middle line:84%
were absolutely so far ahead
of the conventional academic

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:23.880 align:middle line:90%
curriculum.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I can sit here today and
say, yeah, in the beginning--

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I love this part--in the
beginning I would tell

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.664 align:middle line:84%
my scientific colleagues
about look at this research

00:52:32.664 --> 00:52:33.580 align:middle line:90%
and the meaning of it.

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And they would look at me
and go, wow, you're so weird,

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:37.740 align:middle line:90%
that's like you're crazy.

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because
if I went to a biologist

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:43.835 align:middle line:84%
today and actually said this is
what my research was all about

00:52:43.835 --> 00:52:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is what it showed,
they would look at me and go,

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:47.626 align:middle line:84%
so what are you
saying that's new?

00:52:47.626 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's new.

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.061 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So essentially, I
went from freaking them out

00:52:51.061 --> 00:52:51.720 align:middle line:90%
to boring them.

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is I
saw it a long time ago,

00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:00.041 align:middle line:84%
and it has now become the
main front of the new science.

00:53:00.041 --> 00:53:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And the new science
is called epigenetics.

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you have
received awards and changed

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.550 align:middle line:84%
the face of what we
know as the new biology.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:08.390 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And for people that might
not even know about this yet,

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:12.615 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the
reasons why I wanted

00:53:12.615 --> 00:53:15.590 align:middle line:84%
you to be on the show is to let
even more people know there is

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:19.195 align:middle line:84%
a new biology, but it has
a much grander impact.

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:21.080 align:middle line:84%
That it's not just
about the cells,

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.649 align:middle line:84%
but it has to do
with our evolution.

00:53:22.649 --> 00:53:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Oh, absolutely.

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's so exciting because if
you understand the new science,

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:30.770 align:middle line:84%
it's so involved with
personal empowerment.

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:34.530 align:middle line:84%
It personally says you don't
realize how powerful you

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:37.860 align:middle line:84%
are as a human being
because our limiting beliefs

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that we acquired from
the incorrect science

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:43.340 align:middle line:84%
prevent us from taking
charge of our own lives.

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we see ourselves as
victims of our biology, victims

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:48.690 align:middle line:90%
of our genes or biochemistry.

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:50.859 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, my
god, we're the farthest

00:53:50.859 --> 00:53:51.650 align:middle line:90%
thing from victims.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:53.210 align:middle line:90%
We are masters.

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:57.040 align:middle line:84%
We can control every
aspect of our biology.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's time for people
to gather this power.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the new civilization
says that we all

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.250 align:middle line:84%
have to know who we really are
so that when we collectively

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:09.180 align:middle line:84%
work and put our powers
together in harmony,

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.420 align:middle line:84%
the extinction that
seems to be looming

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.602 align:middle line:90%
will actually disappear.

00:54:13.602 --> 00:54:14.560 align:middle line:90%
It will just disappear.

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because of how
powerful that we really are.

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.165 align:middle line:90%
Once we realize that, yes.

00:54:18.165 --> 00:54:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the power that
we've been using right now

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:24.600 align:middle line:84%
is incorrect, and
therefore, destructive.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.730 align:middle line:84%
If we turn the tables
and redirect that power,

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:33.100 align:middle line:84%
then the greatest blossoming
of a garden is available.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's not that far away.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:36.030 align:middle line:90%
We can do it almost overnight.

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:39.145 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love how you
connect what I speak about

00:54:39.145 --> 00:54:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and what I do in terms
of an interviewer

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:45.210 align:middle line:84%
on the positive
thinking process.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But you break it down to the
cellular biology of positive

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:48.630 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:51.010 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just rhetoric,
this isn't just affirmations,

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:52.769 align:middle line:84%
this isn't just a
feel-good conversation.

00:54:52.769 --> 00:54:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: No.

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is something that
has grounded science to it.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is very important
because there's so

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.710 align:middle line:84%
many people who are
distrustful of this concept.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:02.175 align:middle line:84%
You say positive thinking,
they go, oh, you new age guy

00:55:02.175 --> 00:55:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:04.111 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: And I'm going no, no.

00:55:04.111 --> 00:55:06.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why
positive thinking works

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and there's a reason
why it doesn't work.

00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:12.150 align:middle line:84%
If you understand that, then
you can change the tables

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and not be a victim
anymore, but actually

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.799 align:middle line:84%
turn your positive thinking
into creating a positive life.

00:55:17.799 --> 00:55:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so let's
talk about that.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:23.555 align:middle line:84%
How exactly are our genes
affected by their environment?

00:55:23.555 --> 00:55:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: OK, let's go back
to a very simple experiment

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that is so simple that
even if you're not

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:33.190 align:middle line:84%
a biologist the answer is so
profound you can understand it,

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.699 align:middle line:90%
no question.

00:55:33.699 --> 00:55:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: OK, so we go
back to let's say 1967,

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.100 align:middle line:90%
and I'm cloning a stem cell.

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.516 align:middle line:84%
You say, well,
what's a stem cell?

00:55:40.516 --> 00:55:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I say well, in truth, a stem
cell is an embryonic cell.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.513 align:middle line:90%
It's a multi-potential cell.

00:55:44.513 --> 00:55:46.926 align:middle line:90%
It can form bone, skin, muscle.

00:55:46.926 --> 00:55:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It could form any
of the systems.

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you clone it?

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, actually
you take a piece of tissue.

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.830 align:middle line:84%
You take enzymes to
break the cells apart.

00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:57.331 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:55:57.331 --> 00:55:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Now you
have a Petri plate

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:01.320 align:middle line:84%
with lots of different cells
and there are characteristics

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that you can say, oh, that
cell is one of the stem cells.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a physical
characteristic

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.051 align:middle line:90%
of the ones I was working with.

00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I say, oh, cool.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:10.270 align:middle line:84%
If I put like a
little glass ring

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:14.580 align:middle line:84%
around that stem cell and
then I put a little enzyme

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.750 align:middle line:84%
in the solution so it
comes off the Petri plate,

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and I take that little
drop with one cell

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:25.656 align:middle line:84%
and I add that to a Petri
dish and I add one stem cell.

00:56:25.656 --> 00:56:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the significance
is the cell

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.140 align:middle line:90%
divides every 10 to 12 hours.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And so first there's one,
then there's two, 4, 8, 16,

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:32.640 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.500 align:middle line:84%
After about two weeks,
I've got thousands

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:35.650 align:middle line:90%
of cells in the Petri dish.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not the experiment.

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But what it really
shows is this.

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I have thousands of cells, but
here's the most important part.

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.310 align:middle line:84%
They all came from
the same parent.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So by definition,
I have thousands

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:48.580 align:middle line:90%
of genetically identical cells.

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where the
experiment comes from.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I go to that master
dish with my stem cells

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and I take out
some of the cells.

00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And I put them into a
separate Petri dish by itself,

00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.600 align:middle line:90%
but I change the environment.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.230 align:middle line:90%
You say, what's the environment?

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:03.091 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
cells are like fish.

00:57:03.091 --> 00:57:04.340 align:middle line:90%
They live in like an aquarium.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So you have to put all the
right components in the aquarium

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.750 align:middle line:84%
so they can live and breathe
and eat and live in that world.

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:11.491 align:middle line:90%
So that's called culture medium.

00:57:11.491 --> 00:57:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:13.448 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So, it's
the environment.

00:57:13.448 --> 00:57:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So I have a chemical composition
of this culture medium.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I put cells in that dish, so
let's call it Environment A.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And the cells form muscle.

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:22.830 align:middle line:90%
I go, that's great, nice.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:23.730 align:middle line:90%
I go wait, wait.

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Go back to the original dish
with the original stem cells,

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:29.500 align:middle line:84%
grab some more
cells and put them

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.590 align:middle line:84%
into yet another dish with
Environment B, a slightly

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:34.600 align:middle line:90%
different culture environment.

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And in this environment,
the cells form bone.

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:41.036 align:middle line:84%
And then the last step, I go
back to the original dish,

00:57:41.036 --> 00:57:42.910 align:middle line:84%
get some more cells out
of the original dish.

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Put them in a third
Petri dish yet

00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:46.550 align:middle line:84%
with a different
Environment C. And when

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:48.440 align:middle line:90%
I do that, they form fat cells.

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now what are you doing
to change the environment?

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:51.890 align:middle line:84%
You're just changing
the enzymatic structure?

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Changing
the composition

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:53.920 align:middle line:90%
of the growth medium.

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.711 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, got it.

00:57:54.711 --> 00:57:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Just the chemistry.

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And so now I come back
and I say, well, look.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:02.130 align:middle line:84%
What controls the
fate of the cells?

00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Our convention, and what
I was teaching is genes

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.400 align:middle line:90%
control the fate of the cells.

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, first
of all, all these cells

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.780 align:middle line:84%
are genetically identical
so you can't tell me

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.585 align:middle line:84%
because it forms
muscle in one dish

00:58:11.585 --> 00:58:15.004 align:middle line:84%
and bone and fat in
another dish that the genes

00:58:15.004 --> 00:58:16.920 align:middle line:84%
did that because they
all have the same genes.

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because when you
put them in a different dish

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:20.460 align:middle line:84%
when you kept the environment
the same, they would replicate.

00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Exactly the same.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly the same.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: But if I
change the environment,

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.550 align:middle line:84%
they would become
something different.

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So then you're left--
even if you don't know biology,

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what controls
the fate of the cell?

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was
obviously the genes

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:32.260 align:middle line:84%
were all the same so
it wasn't the genes.

00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I say, it was the conditions
or the composition

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.500 align:middle line:90%
of the environment.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And therefore in
different environments,

00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:40.910 align:middle line:90%
the cells have different fate.

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Now here's an exciting piece
of information and look at it

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:44.650 align:middle line:90%
this way.

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I have a plastic dish
of cells and I have

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:48.812 align:middle line:84%
what I call a
healthy environment.

00:58:48.812 --> 00:58:51.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, a nice balanced
environment culture medium.

00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:53.223 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And I take
this dish and I move it

00:58:53.223 --> 00:58:55.250 align:middle line:84%
to a less than optimum
environment, not

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:56.410 align:middle line:90%
a good environment.

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:58.500 align:middle line:84%
The cells will
start to get sick.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And if I had a conventional
allopathic doctor

00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.300 align:middle line:84%
look at my cells, he'd say,
Bruce, your cells are sick.

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.390 align:middle line:90%
You should give them some drugs.

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:09.260 align:middle line:90%
And I go, absolutely not.

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.570 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is take the cells

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:14.380 align:middle line:84%
from the less than optimum
environment, put it back

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.910 align:middle line:84%
into the good environment,
the cells will instantaneously

00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:21.170 align:middle line:84%
recover their health and
the cultures will flourish.

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:22.430 align:middle line:90%
The point is this.

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The cells and their
genetic expression

00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:28.200 align:middle line:84%
become a complement
to the environment.

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.710 align:middle line:90%
And when you are not healthy--

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -then you're
really just reflecting

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're not in harmony
or your environment

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.400 align:middle line:90%
is not supportive.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's-- one caveat so we
don't go way off track.

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: You can have gene
defects that can cause illness.

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, yes.

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: These are
called birth defects.

00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:47.310 align:middle line:84%
You were born with genes that
were altered in such a way

00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:48.080 align:middle line:90%
that they're not giving you--

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.871 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what is
the percentage of that?

00:59:49.871 --> 00:59:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Less than 5%.

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: What does that mean?

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:55.730 align:middle line:84%
95% of the people on
this planet came here

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:57.930 align:middle line:84%
with a set of genes
that should offer them

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:01.610 align:middle line:84%
a healthy, happy, harmonious
existence on this planet.

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But within that set of
genes are the cancer gene is

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.407 align:middle line:84%
present, and maybe the
diabetic gene, and maybe the--

01:00:06.407 --> 01:00:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Ah, but you
see, this is the fact.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Is it a diabetic gene or
a diabetic environment?

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Is it a cancer gene or a
cancer causing environment?

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, so we
have these genes that

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:19.285 align:middle line:84%
may be present
from our genetics.

01:00:19.285 --> 01:00:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: However, you put it
into a stressful environment

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.505 align:middle line:84%
and it expresses the gene and
activates the gene, right?

01:00:24.505 --> 01:00:25.171 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Right.

01:00:25.171 --> 01:00:27.595 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's say
you have a particular cancer

01:00:27.595 --> 01:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and you go to the doctor and
the doctor says, oh, my god,

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
you have this particular
cancer going on.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And then I say, OK.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all they
will say you have this gene.

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I say, OK, first how many people
with this gene get the cancer?

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And they say, OK, in
this particular gene

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
67% of the people that
have this gene get cancer.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And everybody
starts to freak out

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:48.960 align:middle line:90%
because that's more than 1%.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And everybody
is like either--

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a number there.

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -focused on
that and I go, yeah,

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
but you're not asking the
more important question.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Apparently 33% of the
people with this gene

01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
don't have the cancer and
they have the same gene.

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So is it the gene that
causes the cancer?

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.360 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Because you can have the
gene and not have the cancer.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
it's not just the gene;

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
it's the response
to the environment,

01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of
this new science.

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So my effort was, well, how
does the environmental signal

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.130 align:middle line:90%
control the genes?

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.379 align:middle line:90%
Well, the first thing is this.

01:01:20.379 --> 01:01:21.850 align:middle line:90%
The control is not in the genes.

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:23.030 align:middle line:90%
That's a given.

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And I started to recognize
that the organism reads

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
the environmental information
and then adjusts the genes

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
to balance itself against
that particular environment.

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in an
unhealthy environment,

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.310 align:middle line:84%
you will select gene activity
that's not a healthy gene

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
activity but one
that complements

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.124 align:middle line:90%
the unhealthy environment.

01:01:42.124 --> 01:01:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Stressful
environment, OK.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.373 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And if you
really want to recover,

01:01:45.373 --> 01:01:46.985 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
change the genes,

01:01:46.985 --> 01:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
the genes change when you
change the environment.

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:53.215 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's such an-- that is--
I can understand why this was

01:01:53.215 --> 01:01:55.114 align:middle line:84%
an exciting fact
for you to discover

01:01:55.114 --> 01:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and I can understand why
you stopped teaching.

01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, there I am
teaching medical students

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:00.760 align:middle line:84%
genes control your life,
and then I walk into the lab

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and the cells are
saying, yeah, right.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Look, change the
environment and you

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.390 align:middle line:90%
change the genetic activity.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So that was presaging the
concept called epigenetics.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics as a science was
officially named in 1995.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I saw the action and the
mechanics of it in 1967.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So really, it was
so far ahead of the game,

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:26.440 align:middle line:84%
so when I started reporting
it to my colleagues,

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.634 align:middle line:90%
they were not at that level.

01:02:27.634 --> 01:02:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Accepting it, right.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.091 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And therefore, they
looked at it as like, oh,

01:02:31.091 --> 01:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
that's interesting
but it's not real.

01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so this is all great
for a Petri dish and cells,

01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:39.150 align:middle line:84%
but how does this relate to us
as walking around human beings?

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the very
interesting parallel is this.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.150 align:middle line:84%
When we look in a
mirror and see ourselves

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
as individual entities, a
human, I'm Bruce, you're Lisa,

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I say that's a misperception
because we're not

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.460 align:middle line:90%
single entities.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
By truth, we are actually
about 50 trillion cells

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
living in harmony
in a community.

01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at yourself,
it's not a single entity.

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a community of
50 trillion cells.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting
correlation is this.

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.070 align:middle line:84%
We are essentially
skin-covered Petri dishes

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:09.660 align:middle line:90%
with 50 trillion cells inside.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's a culture medium
in there as well called blood.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So the parallels, if I
change the culture medium

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
to cells in a plastic
dish is no different

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
if I alter the culture medium
to cells in a skin-covered Petri

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:23.250 align:middle line:90%
dish.

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, take a plastic
dish from a good environment

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
in a bad environment,
the cells get sick.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.697 align:middle line:84%
Take a human
skin-covered Petri dish

01:03:30.697 --> 01:03:32.530 align:middle line:84%
from a good environment
to a bad environment

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.129 align:middle line:90%
and the cells will get sick, OK?

01:03:34.129 --> 01:03:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Same thing.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Exact same thing, so
it doesn't make a difference

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:38.720 align:middle line:84%
if the cells are
in plastic or skin.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.780 align:middle line:90%
So now here's the issue.

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.544 align:middle line:84%
So we find out from the study
the culture medium controls

01:03:42.544 --> 01:03:43.460 align:middle line:90%
the fate of the cells.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.126 align:middle line:84%
Then I say, yeah, but
the culture medium

01:03:45.126 --> 01:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
in my skin-covered
dish is called blood.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.001 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
well, then, how or what

01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
controls the composition of
the culture medium because

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:54.080 align:middle line:84%
in the end, that
composition is going

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.420 align:middle line:90%
to affect the fate of the cells.

01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does our
environment control our blood?

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:58.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you said?

01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.575 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Yeah, the
chemistry of the blood,

01:03:59.575 --> 01:04:00.574 align:middle line:90%
which is culture medium.

01:04:00.574 --> 01:04:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So I say, OK, so we
look at the environment

01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:04.929 align:middle line:84%
and we have signals
on the outside,

01:04:04.929 --> 01:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
we also have signals on
our internal environment.

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I say, yeah, but what
reads the signals?

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And I say, the nervous
system reads the signals.

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.340 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system provides
what we call perception.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
My eyes perceive
light, et cetera,

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and so we have perception.

01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So the organism, being
us humans in this case,

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
perceive the environment
through the nervous system.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
But there's now one other
step when it comes to humans

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and that is the perception
is not just direct,

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
but it's associated
with the mind

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
because we interpret
what we see.

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So a perception of the
environment comes in,

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
we make an interpretation
called the mind.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the mind feeds back
to the brain and in regard

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.290 align:middle line:84%
to the interpretation
of that perception,

01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
the brain releases different
chemistry into the blood

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and that goes around
to all the cells.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Or the signals can go from
the nervous system via nerves

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and directly give the
signals to the cells.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.490 align:middle line:90%
And the simple point is this.

01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
The cells, their behavior,
and their genetics

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.870 align:middle line:90%
are affected by the signals.

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
But the signals are
mediated by the brain, which

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
are in turn controlled
by our mind.

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the mind has
the perception of something

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and then feeds
that to the cells.

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So you could be in, say,
maybe a stressful environment,

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
but your perception
of that stress

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:31.530 align:middle line:84%
is what directly relates to
the environment of the body.

01:05:31.530 --> 01:05:32.862 align:middle line:90%
That inner Petri dish, right?

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Yeah, it's actually
more the interpretation

01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:35.861 align:middle line:90%
of that perception.

01:05:35.861 --> 01:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So I give an example
about the difference

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
between interpretation
and perception.

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I love extremely hot food,
like with jalapeno peppers.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.130 align:middle line:84%
If I'm sweating
and eating a meal,

01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that means I'm having
a good time, OK?

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's terrifying to me.

01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:52.411 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, see that's
the interesting thing.

01:05:52.411 --> 01:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I eat the jalapeno
pepper, and I have

01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:55.640 align:middle line:90%
a perception of jalapeno pepper.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
You eat a jalapeno pepper,
you have a perception.

01:05:58.170 --> 01:05:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Pain.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.841 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Pain, well, no.

01:05:59.841 --> 01:06:02.120 align:middle line:90%
But there's an interpretation.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
You see, so we both
ate the same pepper.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system picked
up the same information.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you feel
that in your body,

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:14.071 align:middle line:84%
your mind interprets that as
like, oh, my god, stressful.

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: When I have the
same chemistry in my body,

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
my interpretation of that
is, oh, that's really great.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.450 align:middle line:90%
So what's the difference?

01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:25.349 align:middle line:84%
It's not the perception, it's
basically the interpretation.

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My husband's like that.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
He pours hot sauce on
everything that I make.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I think it's my cooking.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line
is that yes, it's

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
my perception of
the jalapeno pepper.

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's your
interpretation.

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My interpretation of it.

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:39.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you travel around
the world, the globe,

01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
multi continents, you're
all over the planet.

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that you do not
perceive that as stressful,

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.040 align:middle line:90%
whereas somebody else could?

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Because the idea
is-- the perception is,

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to sit in
the same stupid airplane

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
in the same stupid airport and
go through all that same stuff.

01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stupid security.

01:06:57.830 --> 01:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Now, the guy
next to me is like, damn,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000 align:middle line:90%
I go through this stuff.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.910 align:middle line:90%
I hate this stuff.

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- and the more
you hate it, the more, what?

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is
releasing chemicals

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.550 align:middle line:84%
that this is not
good, this is bad.

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:12.709 align:middle line:84%
And the chemicals are not
going to make a good response.

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:14.000 align:middle line:90%
If I sit in the same airplane--

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stress levels rise.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Their stress
level rises, OK?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I sit in the same
airplane and go, look,

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I've done this so many times,
like, I'm not paying attention.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.070 align:middle line:84%
We go through this every
time so why should I

01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:24.790 align:middle line:90%
give it any more energy?

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.640 align:middle line:90%
So I just disconnect.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I can sit there and think
of more wonderful things.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.200 align:middle line:84%
If I'm thinking of my partner,
Margaret, for example,

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not releasing
stress hormones.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm releasing a completely
different set of hormones.

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I could
illustrate it.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: I like this.

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
My friend who creates
the covers of my books

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:47.830 align:middle line:84%
took this idea for me and showed
that I'm a cell biologist, OK?

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:48.352 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:07:48.352 --> 01:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: But all of
us, as individually,

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
we're controlling
our own cell cultures

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.770 align:middle line:90%
that are inside our body.

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So the brain is releasing
the chemicals that

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
create the cell culture
medium and, remember,

01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:00.940 align:middle line:84%
the environmental
medium controlled

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.310 align:middle line:90%
the fate of the cells.

01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So while I'm a cell
biologist, all of us

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:07.661 align:middle line:84%
personally are what we
would call self-biologists.

01:08:07.661 --> 01:08:09.035 align:middle line:84%
You're creating
your own biology.

01:08:09.035 --> 01:08:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's so interesting.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.776 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Now I say, OK,
so what does it mean?

01:08:12.776 --> 01:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It says when I
respond to the world,

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
my interpretation
causes neurochemicals

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to be released by my
brain that correspond

01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:20.689 align:middle line:90%
with that interpretation.

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Those chemicals are
then go into the blood.

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And then that blood is
used to feed the cells.

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:28.006 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the
chemistry of the blood,

01:08:28.006 --> 01:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
it will organize the
fate of the cells.

01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:32.024 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if it excretes
the hormone cortisol--

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:32.649 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
stress hormone, right?

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:35.386 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That's a totally
different response.

01:08:35.386 --> 01:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say I open my
eyes and I see someone I love.

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:43.819 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: When I do that, I
release into my blood chemicals

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:48.681 align:middle line:84%
from the brain such as dopamine,
oxytocin, vasopressin, growth

01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:49.180 align:middle line:90%
hormone.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.805 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals--
let me just tell you,

01:08:50.805 --> 01:08:53.229 align:middle line:84%
if I took those chemicals
released in love

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and put it into a plastic
Petri dish with cells,

01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
the cells would grow
exuberantly well.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think about it and I just
say, look, go back to a time

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:03.939 align:middle line:84%
when you were really in a
state of exquisite love,

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:05.040 align:middle line:90%
like a honeymoon.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.666 align:middle line:90%
And I say, were you healthy?

01:09:06.666 --> 01:09:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And most everybody goes, well,
I was exuberantly healthy.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.417 align:middle line:90%
And I go, well, you know why?

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
in a state of love

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.979 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry you
release in the blood

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
is a chemistry that
encourages health and vitality

01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:18.826 align:middle line:90%
and energy in the system.

01:09:18.826 --> 01:09:19.950 align:middle line:90%
And I say, oh, that's cool.

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:21.116 align:middle line:90%
And I say, well, wait, wait.

01:09:21.116 --> 01:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
What if I open up my
eyes and I see something

01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:24.830 align:middle line:90%
that scares me so I'm in fear?

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:26.060 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.481 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals of love are
not going to released now.

01:09:28.481 --> 01:09:30.189 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to
release the cortisol,

01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:32.022 align:middle line:84%
now you're going to
release stress hormones,

01:09:32.022 --> 01:09:34.069 align:middle line:90%
and cytokines, and histamines.

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
These elements get us ready
for fight or flight, OK?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.149 align:middle line:84%
Well, the relevance is
if I took those chemicals

01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and put it into a
plastic Petri dish,

01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:44.730 align:middle line:90%
it stops the growth of my cells.

01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:46.979 align:middle line:84%
And it does that because
it's going to conserve energy

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
for running, fight or flight.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.242 align:middle line:90%
So the point is this.

01:09:50.242 --> 01:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
If you open your eyes
and you're in love,

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:53.539 align:middle line:84%
you create a growth
medium that causes

01:09:53.539 --> 01:09:56.346 align:middle line:84%
the cells to be exuberantly
happy and healthy.

01:09:56.346 --> 01:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you open
your eyes and you

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
see something that stresses,
then all of a sudden

01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry
released by that is

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
chemistry that shuts
down the growth

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.158 align:middle line:90%
and maintenance of the cells.

01:10:05.158 --> 01:10:06.200 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.420 align:middle line:90%
We know now for-- it's a fact.

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
90% of doctor visits are due to
stress, and the reason is why?

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:17.127 align:middle line:84%
Because if you keep releasing
the stress hormones,

01:10:17.127 --> 01:10:19.085 align:middle line:84%
you keep shutting down
the growth of the cells.

01:10:19.085 --> 01:10:19.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That cell.

01:10:19.835 --> 01:10:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's also replicating in
terms of a destructed cell.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.080 align:middle line:90%
That cell is now--

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:24.955 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -degenerating and
replicating degeneration

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and then replicating
more degeneration.

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Right, because the
signals that are released--

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -and that's
what you call cancer.

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The signals
that are released

01:10:34.805 --> 01:10:38.370 align:middle line:84%
are the signals that engage
inappropriate growth signals.

01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
They're not for growth at
all, they're for protection.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And you have to look at it.

01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Growth and protection are
mutually opposite things,

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.440 align:middle line:90%
and the reason is why?

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, if a stimulus
causes growth,

01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
it's something you move
to with your arms open.

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Take it in, assimilate, grow.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But if there's a stimulus out
there that is threatening,

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
you don't move to
the stimulus, you

01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:00.230 align:middle line:90%
move away from the stimulus.

01:11:00.230 --> 01:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but you
also close yourself down,

01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:04.400 align:middle line:90%
protection.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.560 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Growth is forward, open.

01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Protection is backwards, closed.

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
You can't do both of
them at the same time.

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can't be in growth
and in death at the same time,

01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:17.380 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:18.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Exactly.

01:11:18.385 --> 01:11:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet, look at the world
we live in, 24/7, 365 stress.

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.876 align:middle line:84%
The news, the economics,
all this stuff going on.

01:11:24.876 --> 01:11:25.750 align:middle line:90%
So what are we doing?

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Every day we're taking the
growth medium called blood

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and putting it into a chemistry
that actually shuts down

01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:33.450 align:middle line:90%
the maintenance of the system.

01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And the significance of that
is you cannot sustain stress.

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Nature never intended that.

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For long periods
of time, that's true.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.677 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Nature was like, OK,
I'm being chased by a lion.

01:11:44.677 --> 01:11:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm glad I got a
stress system because that's

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
going to let me run like hell
to get away from the lion.

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:52.108 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: But once I get away
from lion, it's like, oh, OK.

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:53.905 align:middle line:84%
Things are good, and
I go back to growth.

01:11:53.905 --> 01:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And actually
there's a response

01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:57.655 align:middle line:84%
that happens there that
allows you to relax, right?

01:11:57.655 --> 01:11:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:01.026 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have that in the
world that we live in today.

01:12:01.026 --> 01:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
We are always running
from that lion.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Even our Darwinian Theory says
you better run from the lion

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:08.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's a struggle
for your existence.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have built
in a belief that

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.612 align:middle line:84%
even causes us to release
this kind of chemistry,

01:12:14.612 --> 01:12:15.820 align:middle line:90%
which is totally destructive.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So to chunk this
up into our human level,

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
if we're constantly in
survival for our jobs

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and terrified of being fired,
or eating terrible food for us,

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:28.865 align:middle line:84%
those are constant
stress responses?

01:12:28.865 --> 01:12:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Those are that-- the chemistry
of our blood to those stimuli

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
are not supportive
of growth at all.

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:39.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they even shut
off the immune system.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.805 align:middle line:84%
So the more stress
you're under, not only

01:12:40.805 --> 01:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
are you not feeding your cells
and keeping them healthy,

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
you're actually even
shutting off the protection

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:49.022 align:middle line:84%
system inside the
body to-- actually,

01:12:49.022 --> 01:12:50.730 align:middle line:84%
the reason why is just
to conserve energy

01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:51.540 align:middle line:90%
for fight or flight.

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.873 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's your perception
of that stress, though.

01:12:53.873 --> 01:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I interviewed
you many years ago

01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and I was a professional athlete
and I asked you at that time,

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
because I was training
very hard and I said,

01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:04.800 align:middle line:84%
does this level of
this vigorous exercise

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.380 align:middle line:90%
put my body into stress?

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I specifically remember
you, on my radio show you said,

01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:10.597 align:middle line:90%
it's your perception of it.

01:13:10.597 --> 01:13:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes.

01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can I tell
you something?

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:12.718 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Please.

01:13:12.718 --> 01:13:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That carried with
me every race that I won.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it was that--
it's my perception

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
of this level of impact
that I'm putting on my body

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.280 align:middle line:90%
right now as a positive impact.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And it made me so
happy and so excited

01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:29.375 align:middle line:84%
when I was in that state
of physical activity--

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -it changed my entire
relationship to exercise.

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:34.675 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
that's the whole idea.

01:13:34.675 --> 01:13:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's
a world out there,

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
our interpretation.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And the world may
be totally healthy,

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.437 align:middle line:84%
and yet we see it as caustic,
or toxic, or noxious.

01:13:45.437 --> 01:13:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And the
fact is I send signals

01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
to my cells from
that interpretation.

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:51.260 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
The cells don't know the
environment's good or bad,

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
they're only taking
the information

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:56.750 align:middle line:90%
that my brain is sending.

01:13:56.750 --> 01:14:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So if I look at the world and
say, oh, my god, it's toxic

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and it's scary--

01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly, yes.

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:03.843 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -then the
chemistry I will release

01:14:03.843 --> 01:14:06.040 align:middle line:84%
will tell the cells
that the world is scary

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and they better get
into protection.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, well, is
the world really scary?

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, that was
just your belief about it.

01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden--
and the same thing

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:16.100 align:middle line:90%
works in the opposite.

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
You could be in a very
toxic environment,

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
but you change your
interpretation of that.

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:24.184 align:middle line:84%
And you look and it's
not threatening to me.

01:14:24.184 --> 01:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, and all of
a sudden it says,

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
it might be toxic on the
outside, but on the inside

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.840 align:middle line:84%
you will keep the harmony and
growth of the system going.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, you
realize the health of your body

01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:36.680 align:middle line:84%
is indirectly connected
to the environment

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
because in between
the environment

01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:40.730 align:middle line:90%
and your body is the mind.

01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
you're responding

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
to your mind, your belief
and our perceptions

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.699 align:middle line:90%
about this environment.

01:14:48.699 --> 01:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is so
interesting because it really,

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
really, really does show if
you're in a toxic environment,

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
if it's a bad relationship,
if it's a bad job, if it's

01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:03.730 align:middle line:84%
poor health, it absolutely
negatively impacts

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.920 align:middle line:90%
your entire cellular structure.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:08.225 align:middle line:90%
And it's the chemistry--

01:15:08.225 --> 01:15:10.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It'll make you
want to get out that.

01:15:10.058 --> 01:15:11.830 align:middle line:84%
If you realize that
on a cellular level

01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that will kick you into
gear to get yourself out

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:15.000 align:middle line:90%
of that situation.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: That's right.

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:16.577 align:middle line:90%
And really it's up to us.

01:15:16.577 --> 01:15:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
that's why I say,

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
it's self-empowerment
because it was well,

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
do you want to believe
that it's toxic

01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:23.826 align:middle line:84%
or do you want to believe
that it's not toxic?

01:15:23.826 --> 01:15:24.930 align:middle line:90%
That's your choice.

01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:26.834 align:middle line:84%
And this one is so
weird, I just have

01:15:26.834 --> 01:15:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to bring it in because
everyone's so concerned about

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.132 align:middle line:84%
well, if I eat this
sugar I'm going to die

01:15:32.132 --> 01:15:33.090 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:35.222 align:middle line:84%
And I say, again,
it's a belief issue.

01:15:35.222 --> 01:15:36.430 align:middle line:90%
And here's why I bring it up.

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of weird,
but in the south

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:41.110 align:middle line:84%
we have fundamentalists
that work themselves up

01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:42.990 align:middle line:90%
in a state of religious ecstasy.

01:15:42.990 --> 01:15:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that religious
ecstasy, they

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:46.730 align:middle line:90%
do something they call testify.

01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:48.917 align:middle line:84%
They want to show that
God is protecting them

01:15:48.917 --> 01:15:50.000 align:middle line:90%
so they do strange things.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are snake
handlers and they

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
play with poisonous snakes,
rattlesnakes, and copperheads.

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is the extreme.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.523 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: This is extreme.

01:15:56.523 --> 01:15:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But extreme or not, it
really shows what's possible.

01:15:59.530 --> 01:16:00.104 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:16:00.104 --> 01:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And even if they
get bitten by the snakes,

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:03.603 align:middle line:90%
there's no adverse consequences.

01:16:03.603 --> 01:16:05.400 align:middle line:90%
And I call those the amateurs.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the real testifying
guys that really blow my mind,

01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:13.850 align:middle line:84%
they drink strychnine
poison in toxic doses

01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:17.470 align:middle line:84%
with the absolute belief
that God will protect them.

01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.252 align:middle line:90%
No harmful consequences.

01:16:20.252 --> 01:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do not try
that at home, however.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.066 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: No.

01:16:22.066 --> 01:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I actually, even if
I'm aware of that,

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:26.396 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to drink
any of that stuff.

01:16:26.396 --> 01:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But, OK, so
now the bottom line

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
here is the entire
environment around us,

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:34.050 align:middle line:84%
no matter what, even
the placebo effect,

01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:37.629 align:middle line:84%
has been shown to
significantly improve health.

01:16:37.629 --> 01:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, that's
what it's all about.

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.045 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you
brought that up, Lisa,

01:16:41.045 --> 01:16:42.712 align:middle line:84%
because the placebo
effect is directly

01:16:42.712 --> 01:16:43.670 align:middle line:90%
what I'm talking about.

01:16:43.670 --> 01:16:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It says this.

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe this pill the doctor
said this is it, the newest

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
thing, and it's got purple
so that's really good color.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.280 align:middle line:84%
This pill is going to save
my life, and I believe that,

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and I take the pill and my life
gets better, which happens.

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you find out later,
but it was just a sugar pill.

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I say,
OK, what cured you?

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.477 align:middle line:84%
The answer is obviously
not the sugar pill.

01:17:08.477 --> 01:17:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It was your belief
that the pill was going

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
to heal you, so it was
your interpretation.

01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:14.830 align:middle line:84%
What your body is
doing is saying,

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're taking
this thing that's

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.870 align:middle line:84%
going to heal us so the
body starts sending healing

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.776 align:middle line:84%
chemistry even before
you start taking the pill

01:17:21.776 --> 01:17:23.150 align:middle line:84%
it will already
start doing that.

01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:24.151 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so magical.

01:17:24.151 --> 01:17:25.608 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And here's
how magical it

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:27.760 align:middle line:84%
is, a fact and people should
really recognize this.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
One-third of all
medical healings,

01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
be they drug or surgery
related, one-third strictly

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.380 align:middle line:90%
placebo effect.

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it that high?

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: It's that high.

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It's that high.

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And so while we're
doing this, please let's

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:41.914 align:middle line:84%
add the other side
of the picture

01:17:41.914 --> 01:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
because people always reference
the placebo effect about how

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
this positive thinking
can create health.

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to
tell you is this.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not positive thinking,
it's thinking affects health

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.510 align:middle line:90%
for this reason.

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:55.325 align:middle line:84%
There's a word that
science has given it,

01:17:55.325 --> 01:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
but the public's
not aware of it.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.020 align:middle line:90%
It's called the nocebo effect.

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Nocebo is a negative thought.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
What is a negative
thought, the influence?

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:04.340 align:middle line:84%
We only talked about
the positive thought.

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.130 align:middle line:90%
And I go, no, no.

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Science has revealed
that negative thoughts

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and positive thoughts
are equally powerful,

01:18:08.970 --> 01:18:11.020 align:middle line:84%
but they work in
opposite directions.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
A positive thought can heal
you, but a negative thought

01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:17.400 align:middle line:90%
can actually kill you.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
mechanism, it's

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:22.737 align:middle line:84%
just that the thought is
translated into chemistry.

01:18:22.737 --> 01:18:24.153 align:middle line:84%
The chemistry
matches the thought.

01:18:24.153 --> 01:18:24.944 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hallelujah!

01:18:24.944 --> 01:18:27.000 align:middle line:90%
This is exactly, yes.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And we have to own
that because psychologists tell

01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:31.590 align:middle line:84%
us that about 70%
of our thoughts

01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:33.540 align:middle line:90%
are negative and redundant.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I believe that, yeah.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So it says, just
in your everyday life,

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:36.690 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

01:18:36.690 --> 01:18:37.440 align:middle line:90%
You're secreting--

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.231 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly,

01:18:38.231 --> 01:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -chemistry that is
taking away your vitality.

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this has to do with
the subconscious mind, though.

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The conscious and the
subconscious mind are the two,

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.346 align:middle line:84%
and it's interesting
because they're two minds

01:18:47.346 --> 01:18:49.582 align:middle line:84%
and that's where all
the problems arise.

01:18:49.582 --> 01:18:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Because when people talk about
my mind, and I go, oh, wait.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:52.940 align:middle line:90%
There's two parts--

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which one?

01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -to this
mind and each part

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.200 align:middle line:84%
has a different function
and different activity.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you have to
understand what the two are

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and how they interact
with each other.

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you
understand that, that's

01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
where your personal
empowerment comes back.

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we can override the
subconscious negative programs

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
with the conscious programming
of willfulness, happiness,

01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:17.370 align:middle line:90%
positivity.

01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:19.707 align:middle line:84%
But there's more specifics
that you can get into.

01:19:19.707 --> 01:19:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah, basically.

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what the
difference between the two

01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:23.260 align:middle line:90%
minds are, OK?

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:25.579 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The conscious
mind is the latest

01:19:25.579 --> 01:19:26.464 align:middle line:90%
evolutionary advance.

01:19:26.464 --> 01:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
piece of the brain

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.640 align:middle line:84%
right behind your forehead
called the prefrontal cortex.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, what is the
role of the conscious mind?

01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tell you,
the conscious mind

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.530 align:middle line:90%
is your connection to yourself.

01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Your personal identity.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Your spirit.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Who you are.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.920 align:middle line:84%
That's coming in from
the conscious mind, OK?

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, that's our
source of personal identity.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And I go, the conscious
mind is also very creative.

01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:49.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a creative mind.

01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:52.597 align:middle line:84%
It can tell us, Lisa, what
are you doing next week?

01:19:52.597 --> 01:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And the significance about that
is well, next week's not here,

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.040 align:middle line:84%
but if you can give me
an answer, by definition,

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.620 align:middle line:84%
you are already
expressing creativity.

01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: I go, OK, but here's
where the core thing is.

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:08.840 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind is the
source of your personal wishes

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and your personal desires,
and your personal aspirations,

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:13.460 align:middle line:90%
this creative mind.

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:16.537 align:middle line:84%
So I say, oh, conscious mind
has what you want out of life.

01:20:16.537 --> 01:20:18.370 align:middle line:84%
It has all your wishes
and all your desires.

01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you're operating
from the conscious mind,

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:24.756 align:middle line:84%
it's going to feed the system
the chemistry to support

01:20:24.756 --> 01:20:26.130 align:middle line:84%
what you really
want out of life.

01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's where your
goals are located, and that's--

01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:30.464 align:middle line:84%
That's your creat-- because
you haven't acquired them yet

01:20:30.464 --> 01:20:32.650 align:middle line:84%
by definition,
your conscious mind

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
is going to create
what your goal is.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what
your visions are also?

01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:36.351 align:middle line:90%
Do you just--

01:20:36.351 --> 01:20:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely,
because they're not real yet.

01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So your conscious mind is
wishes, desires, aspirations.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.870 align:middle line:90%
It's also positive thinking.

01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if you can imagine
it and see it, then you can--

01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Then it's manifesting
from this conscious mind, OK?

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.603 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So I go,
that's really cool.

01:20:50.603 --> 01:20:53.477 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, conscious mind
is you, creativity, et cetera.

01:20:53.477 --> 01:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I say, what about
the subconscious mind?

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:57.130 align:middle line:84%
You go, oh, that's
the rest of the brain

01:20:57.130 --> 01:20:58.590 align:middle line:84%
besides that little
frontal piece.

01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's an
enormous amount.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.614 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Yeah,
because the brain

01:21:01.614 --> 01:21:03.350 align:middle line:84%
was evolved before
consciousness evolved.

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- so consciousness
was an add on more or less.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And interesting as
an add on option,

01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:08.640 align:middle line:90%
most people don't even use it.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.797 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious is
essentially the whole brain.

01:21:12.797 --> 01:21:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what
is the subconscious?

01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Oh, It's more like a
record playback device.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:21.174 align:middle line:84%
It records your experiences, and
then at the push of a button,

01:21:21.174 --> 01:21:22.090 align:middle line:90%
it can play them back.

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:23.631 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
push it back, it's

01:21:23.631 --> 01:21:25.130 align:middle line:90%
a very accurate recording thing.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So every time you
push it back, it's

01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:29.980 align:middle line:84%
going to play the same thing
over and over and over again.

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And all this is
imprinted in the first seven

01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:33.330 align:middle line:90%
years of your life, right?

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the fundamental
beliefs are put into it

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and so it's a habitual mind,
but the first habits are really

01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:43.550 align:middle line:84%
acquired from your instincts
and your experiences.

01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And so here-- what
we now know is this.

01:21:46.190 --> 01:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%
The first six years of
your life, your brain's

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
not even operating at
the conscious level.

01:21:51.010 --> 01:21:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Its EEG, the predominant
brain state, is called theta.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Alpha, the next higher
level is consciousness.

01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Theta is just below
consciousness.

01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:01.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a state of imagination.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where kids are from
especially between two and six.

01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: They mix the
imaginary and the real world.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.099 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:22:07.099 --> 01:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Their brain is operating at a
level of theta, imagination.

01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's also this
brain state of hypnosis.

01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.410 align:middle line:90%
What it means is this.

01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:16.910 align:middle line:84%
The first six
years of your life,

01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:19.780 align:middle line:84%
you're not really conscious,
you're in a state of hypnosis.

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:22.942 align:middle line:84%
You observe everyone around you,
specifically your parents first

01:22:22.942 --> 01:22:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and then your family
and community.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.670 align:middle line:90%
What are you observing?

01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
You're observing their
behaviors and you're

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:30.940 align:middle line:84%
downloading their behaviors
and their responses.

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not what you
say, it's what you do.

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: And that's the issue.

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why parents don't
realize, every move they make,

01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
the child is like the
record button is on.

01:22:39.330 --> 01:22:40.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not off, it's on.

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So everything that the
parents are doing is recorded.

01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So the first programs in
your subconscious mind

01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:49.080 align:middle line:90%
are not even yours.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.410 align:middle line:84%
They're acquired by downloading
other people's beliefs.

01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So all of my
relationship to everything

01:22:55.190 --> 01:22:57.710 align:middle line:90%
is being recorded by my child?

01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: By your
child, absolutely.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a new thing
because the Jesuits were

01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:05.270 align:middle line:84%
very proud of the fact that
they say, give me a child

01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:06.730 align:middle line:90%
and I will show you the man.

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
What do they know
is if I can get

01:23:08.190 --> 01:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
the programming
of the child, then

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I will control the
outcome of that person.

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:14.352 align:middle line:84%
Or they would sometimes
say, give me a child

01:23:14.352 --> 01:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
until it's six or
seven and it will

01:23:15.810 --> 01:23:17.880 align:middle line:84%
belong to the church for
the rest of its life.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.980 align:middle line:84%
What they knew is that
if I can instill a belief

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.117 align:middle line:84%
system in there before
seven years of age,

01:23:24.117 --> 01:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
then that belief system
is going to be fundamental

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.870 align:middle line:90%
in the subconscious, OK?

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So now here's the
issue that most people

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:30.560 align:middle line:90%
have a problem with.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Most of us walk
down the street saying,

01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:34.221 align:middle line:84%
yes, I'm controlling
my life with my wishes

01:23:34.221 --> 01:23:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and my desires, my
positive thinking.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I go, that's really
cool except science

01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
has revealed that
that's not true at all.

01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Science has revealed that
we operate 5% of the time

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.870 align:middle line:84%
from our conscious
mind, which means

01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
we operate 95% of the time
from our subconscious mind.

01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:52.490 align:middle line:90%
You say, well, how come?

01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:55.754 align:middle line:84%
And I go, remember the conscious
mind is not time bound.

01:23:55.754 --> 01:23:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I asked you what are
you doing next week

01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:58.210 align:middle line:90%
and you gave me an answer.

01:23:58.210 --> 01:23:59.839 align:middle line:84%
I say, Lisa, what
did you do last week?

01:23:59.839 --> 01:24:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And your mind goes
back to last week.

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And I say, while
we're sitting here,

01:24:03.930 --> 01:24:05.240 align:middle line:90%
solve the square root of 3.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And your mind will
disconnect, go up in your head

01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:08.450 align:middle line:90%
and start solving.

01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And so basically it says
this, the conscious mind

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:12.380 align:middle line:90%
is not always present.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.600 align:middle line:90%
It's thinking.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out it's
thinking 95% of the time.

01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the problem.

01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
If the conscious mind is engaged
in some kind of thinking,

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
then it's not paying
attention, and the default

01:24:24.090 --> 01:24:25.860 align:middle line:90%
is the subconscious.

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So every time your conscious
mind is thinking a thought,

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:32.200 align:middle line:84%
you then go into the
subconscious program.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.064 align:middle line:90%
So our issue is this.

01:24:34.064 --> 01:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
How come positive
thinking doesn't work?

01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And I go, because you're
only using it 5% of the time.

01:24:39.650 --> 01:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
95% of the time, you're
operating off the subconscious.

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And then here's the conflict.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, how do you?

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The subconscious
is not even basically

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.760 align:middle line:90%
your behavior.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.080 align:middle line:90%
You got it from other people.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But how do you change
that subconscious programming,

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:52.050 align:middle line:90%
or?

01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: First, recognize it.

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:53.455 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Good start.

01:24:53.850 --> 01:24:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: You have to recognize
you have this subconscious

01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:56.442 align:middle line:90%
programming, OK?

01:24:56.442 --> 01:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
because they still think,

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.870 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm operating my life
with my conscious creativity.

01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:02.690 align:middle line:90%
And I go, 5%.

01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:05.260 align:middle line:84%
95% you're playing these
subconscious programs you

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.400 align:middle line:90%
got from your family.

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.982 align:middle line:84%
And as I love to
say in the lectures

01:25:07.982 --> 01:25:09.690 align:middle line:84%
because most people
laugh because they're

01:25:09.690 --> 01:25:10.523 align:middle line:90%
so familiar with it.

01:25:10.523 --> 01:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I say look, you have
a very close friend.

01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:14.670 align:middle line:84%
You know your friend's
behavior, and you

01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:16.680 align:middle line:84%
happen to know your
friend's parent.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And I say, then someday
you casually recognize

01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that your friend shares
some of the same behavior

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.910 align:middle line:84%
as their parents, so you say
your friend, hey, you know,

01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Bill, you're just like your dad.

01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And you back away from Bill.

01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you get mad.

01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:32.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Because Bill's
the one that's like,

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:34.990 align:middle line:84%
how-- how can you
compare me to my dad?

01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well,
there are two very

01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:38.380 align:middle line:84%
profound points from
one simple story,

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and profound point
number one is this.

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:42.969 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else can see that
Bill behaves like his dad;

01:25:42.969 --> 01:25:44.385 align:middle line:84%
it's only Bill who
doesn't see it.

01:25:44.385 --> 01:25:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:45.169 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And this
is very profound.

01:25:47.130 --> 01:25:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Why does he behave like his dad?

01:25:48.330 --> 01:25:50.413 align:middle line:84%
Because he got the program
in the first five years

01:25:50.413 --> 01:25:51.540 align:middle line:90%
by observing his dad.

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So when his mind is
not paying attention,

01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:55.810 align:middle line:90%
he plays his father's behavior.

01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But because his mind's
not paying attention,

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.460 align:middle line:90%
he doesn't see it, OK?

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:00.839 align:middle line:90%
And profound point number two.

01:26:00.839 --> 01:26:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, because I want to--
yeah, how do you change this?

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:03.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: I'm going
to get to that.

01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:05.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Profound point
number two is we are all Bill,

01:26:06.915 --> 01:26:08.590 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we have to own.

01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:11.206 align:middle line:84%
95% of our behavior
is invisible to us.

01:26:11.206 --> 01:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And most of that behavior
has been programmed

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.350 align:middle line:84%
by other people, and
it has their beliefs

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:18.920 align:middle line:84%
or wishes not ours, or
their way of life, not ours.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it turns out,
are we living the lives

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.460 align:middle line:90%
that we really want?

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Or are we living
the lives that we've

01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:26.367 align:middle line:90%
been programmed to live, OK?

01:26:26.367 --> 01:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And how important
is this programming?

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:31.440 align:middle line:84%
This is a very important fact
that people have to gather.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:34.730 align:middle line:84%
When a child is adopted
into a family that

01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:38.890 align:middle line:84%
has a lineage of cancer,
the adopted child

01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:42.180 align:middle line:84%
will get the family cancer
with the same propensity

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.562 align:middle line:90%
as any of the natural siblings.

01:26:43.562 --> 01:26:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Without the--

01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Without the genetics.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And what it turned out is,
as I said, 90% of cancer

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.430 align:middle line:90%
is lifestyle.

01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:55.164 align:middle line:84%
90% of cancers, how do you
learn to respond to the world?

01:26:55.164 --> 01:26:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, you learn
this from your parents,

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.700 align:middle line:84%
whether you're adopted
or you're genetic family,

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
it's still you're learning
the same behavior.

01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So the
cancer is expressed

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
in the adopted
child just the same.

01:27:06.170 --> 01:27:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Again--

01:27:06.670 --> 01:27:07.005 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

01:27:07.005 --> 01:27:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: -important point.

01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not in your genes;
it's in your response

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:11.870 align:middle line:90%
to the environment.

01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Response to
the environment, yes.

01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: So now--

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.916 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so then-- all
right, so how do you change it?

01:27:16.916 --> 01:27:18.706 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you,
how do you change it?

01:27:18.706 --> 01:27:20.260 align:middle line:84%
What do you do with
this information?

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.600 align:middle line:84%
How do we know and how we move
forward with this information?

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's put it this way.

01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:30.140 align:middle line:84%
What if you-- first
question is this,

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:32.580 align:middle line:84%
what-- eliminate the
subconscious for a minute

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:35.032 align:middle line:84%
and just say, if
you could live just

01:27:35.032 --> 01:27:36.990 align:middle line:84%
from your conscious mind,
which has your wishes

01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and desires and aspirations,
what would your life be like?

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going
to say, most people

01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:42.876 align:middle line:84%
have done this in a
period of their life

01:27:42.876 --> 01:27:44.804 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
realize it, but they'll

01:27:44.804 --> 01:27:46.220 align:middle line:84%
know the period
I'm talking about.

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:48.972 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when you fall
deeply in love with somebody.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, everyone
remembers that, yes.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.290 align:middle line:90%
I call it the honeymoon effect.

01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And I say, what is
the honeymoon effect?

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.901 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, go back to that
time you fell deeply in love

01:27:56.901 --> 01:27:57.520 align:middle line:90%
with somebody.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.740 align:middle line:90%
And I say, were you healthy?

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.325 align:middle line:84%
And almost everybody says oh,
I was exuberantly healthy.

01:28:01.325 --> 01:28:02.450 align:middle line:90%
I say, did you have energy?

01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And they say, of course, we
had an abundance of energy.

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And I go, was life so beautiful
when you were in the honeymoon

01:28:09.930 --> 01:28:10.892 align:middle line:90%
that--

01:28:10.892 --> 01:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rose-colored glasses.

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.391 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Rose-colored glasses.

01:28:13.391 --> 01:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Life was heaven on
Earth, wasn't it?

01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And I go, that was
not an accident.

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.120 align:middle line:90%
That was a creation.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Because science has now
recognized the unique fact

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:25.980 align:middle line:84%
when you fell in love
like that, you absolutely

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.640 align:middle line:84%
operated almost primarily
from the conscious mind

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.059 align:middle line:84%
and did not go into
the default program.

01:28:31.059 --> 01:28:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In that
short period of time,

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.470 align:middle line:84%
you're operating from
the conscious mind.

01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And it's
also-- another term

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.440 align:middle line:84%
is like being mindful,
or Buddhist mindfulness.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the same idea.

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:40.920 align:middle line:90%
It says what?

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.350 align:middle line:84%
If I don't know operate from
the subconscious programs

01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:45.770 align:middle line:84%
with its limiting beliefs
that were acquired

01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm operating only
from the mind that

01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
has wishes and desires
and aspirations,

01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:52.030 align:middle line:84%
then every decision
and every action

01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:56.060 align:middle line:84%
is done with my wish and
my desire attached to it.

01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:57.492 align:middle line:84%
OK, when two people
come together

01:28:57.492 --> 01:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're both in
the honeymoon effect,

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.445 align:middle line:84%
then they're both creating
from their conscious minds

01:29:01.445 --> 01:29:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and this is called
the honeymoon.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.180 align:middle line:90%
And now you might then say--

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, how
come it doesn't last?

01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: How come
it doesn't last?

01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:08.164 align:middle line:84%
And that's a perfect
question for this reason

01:29:08.164 --> 01:29:09.530 align:middle line:90%
is why doesn't it last?

01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is this.

01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Because at some
point life gets busy.

01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:16.259 align:middle line:84%
You still have to pay the rent,
you still got to fix the car.

01:29:16.259 --> 01:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
You still have to do these
things, so what is it?

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Your mind starts to think about
oh, what am I going to do?

01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:22.330 align:middle line:90%
What's my schedule?

01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:23.163 align:middle line:90%
What's on my agenda?

01:29:23.163 --> 01:29:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Enter in stress.

01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:26.039 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And stress
and all these things.

01:29:26.039 --> 01:29:28.529 align:middle line:84%
So now let's say
you and I are having

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:31.070 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful relationship and
we're in the honeymoon thing,

01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking
about all of a sudden,

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.054 align:middle line:90%
oh, I got to pay the rent.

01:29:35.054 --> 01:29:36.220 align:middle line:90%
How am I'm going to do this?

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And you come up and you
ask me some simple question

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:40.891 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in this state, and I
turn around and go, Lisa, blah,

01:29:40.891 --> 01:29:42.340 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah.

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And you look at me and
you go, who are you?

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.515 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where's the
honeymoon effect?

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Where's
the honeymoon now?

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.901 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, what
happened, and here's what

01:29:50.901 --> 01:29:51.580 align:middle line:90%
happened.

01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Up to now, we were
both operating

01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:55.956 align:middle line:84%
from our conscious
wishes and desires.

01:29:55.956 --> 01:29:57.830 align:middle line:84%
At that moment when you
ask me that question,

01:29:57.830 --> 01:30:00.100 align:middle line:84%
my conscious mind was
busy, so what do I do?

01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Default, subconscious.

01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Whose behavior is in there?

01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:03.667 align:middle line:90%
My father's.

01:30:03.667 --> 01:30:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your programming--

01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:06.166 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And all
of a sudden, you

01:30:06.166 --> 01:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
see this behavior that
was my father's, right?

01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:11.089 align:middle line:84%
And it came out and you
looked at me and said, look,

01:30:11.089 --> 01:30:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I've been with you for
this whole period of time.

01:30:13.130 --> 01:30:14.120 align:middle line:90%
I never saw this.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.946 align:middle line:90%
Who are you with that behavior?

01:30:15.946 --> 01:30:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And here's where the problem
comes in in the relationship

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:22.310 align:middle line:84%
because, as I mentioned before,
did I even see what I said?

01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:25.640 align:middle line:84%
No, because I was coming
from my subconscious mind.

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
you say, who are you?

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I feel,
what do you mean who am I?

01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:32.740 align:middle line:90%
I've always been this way?

01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:33.323 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:30:33.323 --> 01:30:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And it's like,
well, that's absolutely true,

01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:37.790 align:middle line:84%
but I never-- I didn't see
what I just said either.

01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:40.331 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This could explain why
the divorce rate is so high.

01:30:40.331 --> 01:30:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Exactly.

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is as
the relationship continues,

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:47.710 align:middle line:84%
as life gets involved and more
and more of these subconscious

01:30:47.710 --> 01:30:50.700 align:middle line:84%
programs start showing up, they
were not part of the honeymoon.

01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:52.200 align:middle line:84%
If they started
off on day one, you

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.620 align:middle line:90%
may have not gotten to day two.

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But you did the honeymoon,
but now these show up

01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:58.605 align:middle line:84%
and now you're in
a funny position.

01:30:58.605 --> 01:31:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I really
love the honeymoon part.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
These new behaviors I'm
not really happy with,

01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.460 align:middle line:90%
but I'll compromise.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.389 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll accept
those lousy behaviors

01:31:07.389 --> 01:31:09.180 align:middle line:84%
because I really love
this honeymoon stuff.

01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:09.763 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:31:09.763 --> 01:31:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Because I want that back.

01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Because I want the honeymoon.

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And yet, the
glow of the honeymoon

01:31:12.730 --> 01:31:15.140 align:middle line:84%
starts to disappear now
we have life again here.

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:16.320 align:middle line:90%
But the question is this.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But if a lot of these behaviors
show up and a lot of them

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:22.430 align:middle line:84%
may be not even something
you want to compromise with,

01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that then ultimately
went from honeymoon

01:31:26.130 --> 01:31:29.710 align:middle line:90%
to compromise to separation.

01:31:29.710 --> 01:31:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's a result of I can't
compromise that much anymore.

01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, finally,
what would happen

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.070 align:middle line:90%
if you could reprogram the mind?

01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:41.300 align:middle line:84%
What if you could
reprogram that subconscious

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:43.880 align:middle line:84%
so that it had the exact
same beliefs of your wishes

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.160 align:middle line:90%
and desires?

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.870 align:middle line:84%
The significance on a
piece of paper is simple.

01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:50.090 align:middle line:84%
That means if your
mind starts to wander

01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and you kick into
the subconscious,

01:31:52.230 --> 01:31:54.160 align:middle line:84%
you'll still be playing
the same behaviors

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.770 align:middle line:90%
that you used in the honeymoon.

01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Perpetual honeymoon.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can control
this with the conscious mind.

01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And to wrap all of this up
and all of this together,

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.900 align:middle line:84%
this is how you change
the environment back

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.120 align:middle line:84%
to the healthy environment
in the Petri dish

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.300 align:middle line:90%
is with the conscious mind.

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely,
because the conscious mind

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:13.937 align:middle line:84%
is the one that
puts the chemistry

01:32:13.937 --> 01:32:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and that fits what you
want out of life, not

01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:17.340 align:middle line:90%
the program that you received.

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.079 align:middle line:84%
Now if I can create
heaven on Earth

01:32:19.079 --> 01:32:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and you could create
heaven on Earth,

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:22.870 align:middle line:84%
then I start to realize that
my neighbors are creating

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:25.080 align:middle line:84%
heaven on Earth,
and these people.

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.530 align:middle line:84%
At some point, you
realize, well, Earth

01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:30.014 align:middle line:84%
could be heaven if everybody
just put in their own,

01:32:30.014 --> 01:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, their
wishes and desires

01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and got rid of the
bad programming that's

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.440 align:middle line:84%
been passed from
generation to generation.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.190 align:middle line:84%
It didn't just come
from my parents.

01:32:37.190 --> 01:32:38.690 align:middle line:84%
My parents had
parents who gave them

01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:41.387 align:middle line:84%
the belief that they
passed on to me.

01:32:41.387 --> 01:32:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is-- exactly.

01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:44.860 align:middle line:84%
This is what it means to
change the environment,

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.630 align:middle line:84%
your perception of
the environment.

01:32:46.630 --> 01:32:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And if critical
mass can do that,

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.846 align:middle line:84%
this is how you create
spontaneous evolution.

01:32:51.846 --> 01:32:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:52.975 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

01:32:52.975 --> 01:32:53.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is the
name of your book.

01:32:53.605 --> 01:32:55.188 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -why I get
so excited about,

01:32:55.188 --> 01:32:57.672 align:middle line:84%
look, if we had knowledge
that was incorrect

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and we operate from
that knowledge,

01:32:59.130 --> 01:33:01.805 align:middle line:84%
then by definition, a lack of
knowledge is a lack of power.

01:33:01.805 --> 01:33:04.180 align:middle line:84%
If we get this new information
out to the public and say,

01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.440 align:middle line:90%
you're not a victim.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.230 align:middle line:90%
You're a powerful person.

01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:08.980 align:middle line:84%
You could drink
strychnine if you want to.

01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm
interested in doing it.

01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't suggest that.

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.631 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: But the fact is,
you can do all these things.

01:33:13.631 --> 01:33:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And the issue then
says, we're not

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:18.990 align:middle line:84%
dependent on other
people for our happiness,

01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:21.575 align:middle line:84%
we just have to look at
what's been conflicting.

01:33:21.575 --> 01:33:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, it's
not your conscious mind

01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:25.610 align:middle line:90%
that's conflicting.

01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:27.790 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind has all
that positive thinking.

01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:31.700 align:middle line:84%
But the default mind
takes 95% of the show.

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.522 align:middle line:90%
If you become aware of it--

01:33:33.522 --> 01:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And change
your perception.

01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: -change, you
can change these beliefs.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.632 align:middle line:84%
And the issue about changing
beliefs, very quickly, is

01:33:40.632 --> 01:33:42.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
say, well, I'm just

01:33:42.090 --> 01:33:43.950 align:middle line:84%
going to give myself
a good talking to.

01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say,
you know, Bruce,

01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.780 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to take
care of your weight here

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and you have this
donut in your hand.

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, what are
you doing with that donut?

01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
mad at yourself.

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.820 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing with this
stupid donut, you know, blah,

01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:56.190 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah.

01:33:56.190 --> 01:33:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And you get mad at yourself
and you're talking to yourself,

01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:58.998 align:middle line:90%
don't do that, don't do that.

01:33:58.998 --> 01:34:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I say, who are
you talking to?

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is, well, I'm
talking to my subconscious

01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.860 align:middle line:90%
mind.

01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, that's where
the problem comes from.

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.740 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody in the
subconscious mind.

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a machine, it's a recorder.

01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I say you have a tape recorder,
it's playing a program,

01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and I say go up and
talk to it and tell me

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.250 align:middle line:90%
when the program changes.

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:17.400 align:middle line:90%
The answer is it won't change.

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:17.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't--

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you
put the donut down?

01:34:19.730 --> 01:34:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, you have
to push the record button

01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:22.883 align:middle line:84%
and put a new program
into the subconscious.

01:34:22.883 --> 01:34:24.891 align:middle line:90%
There's a record process, OK?

01:34:24.891 --> 01:34:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, how does
the subconscious mind learn?

01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Not the way the
conscious mind learns.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Conscious mind, creative,
read a self-help book.

01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:33.560 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the book
I say, here's a quiz.

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you really learn
what was in the book?

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.050 align:middle line:90%
You say, yeah, I got 100.

01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.940 align:middle line:90%
I say, great.

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.900 align:middle line:84%
You really know about
this self-help book.

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Did your life change?

01:34:40.110 --> 01:34:41.170 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:42.400 align:middle line:90%
And I go, why?

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Because you educated
your conscious mind.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.540 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
mind learns primarily

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:50.520 align:middle line:84%
from habit or hypnosis, like it
learned in the first six years

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.210 align:middle line:90%
is hypnosis.

01:34:51.210 --> 01:34:53.400 align:middle line:84%
After that, how did
you learn something?

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.870 align:middle line:84%
You repeated it and you
repeated it and you repeated it.

01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:58.150 align:middle line:84%
That's how the
subconscious mind learns.

01:34:58.150 --> 01:35:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So reading a self-help book does
not change the subconscious.

01:35:01.690 --> 01:35:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what does is
making the conscious decisions

01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:05.405 align:middle line:90%
and repeating--

01:35:05.405 --> 01:35:06.488 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: To make a habit.

01:35:06.488 --> 01:35:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: -habitually, yes.

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Make a
habit out something.

01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:10.038 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great point.

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And that-- it's beautiful how
you tied all of this together,

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:17.330 align:middle line:84%
how you took the concept of
our positive thoughts really do

01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:20.910 align:middle line:84%
impact the genes and move
us towards a place of growth

01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and the cells towards
a place of growth.

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.860 align:middle line:84%
You have to then repeat it and
change your perception of it

01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
in order to create that healthy
environment for ourselves.

01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:32.355 align:middle line:84%
This can also happen in
our environment, so--

01:35:32.355 --> 01:35:33.416 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Oh, absolutely.

01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And just so I
don't want to leave

01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:36.581 align:middle line:84%
people that just have
to work like a habit.

01:35:36.581 --> 01:35:40.040 align:middle line:84%
There is a new field called
energy psychology, which

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.490 align:middle line:84%
is a super learning
process, which

01:35:41.490 --> 01:35:44.060 align:middle line:84%
is a very effective way of
pushing the record button

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and changing beliefs in
a short period of time.

01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can do that.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.800 align:middle line:90%
You could do hypnosis.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.987 align:middle line:84%
You could do
subconscious programming.

01:35:49.987 --> 01:35:51.570 align:middle line:84%
You can do all those
different things.

01:35:51.570 --> 01:35:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: All of those things,
but you have to do a process.

01:35:53.610 --> 01:35:56.257 align:middle line:84%
You can't just sit there and
say, OK, don't do that anymore.

01:35:56.257 --> 01:35:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Pure will.

01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That's
not doing anything.

01:35:58.090 --> 01:35:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:35:58.450 --> 01:36:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But those other programs
are very, very effective.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you so much for
your incredible contribution

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:09.065 align:middle line:84%
to our evolution
and through science

01:36:09.065 --> 01:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
that you've explained
everything so clearly, and so

01:36:11.190 --> 01:36:14.460 align:middle line:84%
passionately and beautifully,
and so inspirationally.

01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Is that a word?

01:36:15.690 --> 01:36:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Dr. Lipton.

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:18.604 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Lisa, thank
you so very much.

01:36:18.604 --> 01:36:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to thank
all the people out there

01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:22.420 align:middle line:90%
for a very simple reason.

01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:26.175 align:middle line:84%
It's that we're all in an
evolutionary process right now

01:36:26.175 --> 01:36:29.790 align:middle line:84%
in that this is us
and we are powerful

01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:32.715 align:middle line:84%
and we can change this
world back into the garden

01:36:32.715 --> 01:36:34.124 align:middle line:90%
that it was once.

01:36:34.124 --> 01:36:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:35.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully said.

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being a part

01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:39.959 align:middle line:90%
of this conscious evolution.

01:36:39.959 --> 01:36:42.250 align:middle line:84%
