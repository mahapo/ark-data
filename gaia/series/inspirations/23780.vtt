00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.030 align:middle line:84%
We are coming to you live
from Boulder, Colorado,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:90%
from the Gaiam Studios here.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:10%
And this is a live
show, so I encourage

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.807 align:middle line:10%
you to interact with us
on Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:10%
I'll be asking your questions
throughout the show,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:10%
so keep the comments coming in.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.139 align:middle line:10%
So did you know that your
thoughts control your genes?

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:39.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, I don't mean the
jeans you're wearing.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean the genes inside
your body, your DNA.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:84%
This could be one of the biggest
breakthroughs in science today,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
learning how to turn on and
off the genetic activity

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:84%
of your cells with the
power of your thoughts

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:90%
and your perceptions.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today, to help
us explore this concept,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770 align:middle line:84%
is cellular biologist
Dr. Bruce Lipton.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lipton is an
internationally-recognized

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
leader in the field
of epigenetics,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're
talking about today.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
His groundbreaking
discoveries in the field

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:84%
of the new biology
and epigenetics

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:84%
are the foundation
for human evolution.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us today.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUCE L. LIPTON: Lisa,
thank you so very much.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.327 align:middle line:84%
It's a great opportunity to
talk about an exciting evolution

00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:90%
in our planet.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's all new science.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It has to do,
really, with human evolution.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:84%
You link the science and
biology to human evolution,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.666 align:middle line:90%
which is not an easy task.

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, it's so
profoundly important.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:10%
Because up at this
point in time,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:10%
we really bought into
the belief that we're

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.883 align:middle line:10%
more or less victims
of our heredity--

00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: --that we
didn't pick the genes,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:10%
and we can't change the genes.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:10%
And yet, these genes
control our characteristics.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out, the
new science reveals

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:10%
this is a completely
false assumption

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:10%
and that we are so profoundly
powerful, because not only do

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:10%
we select and
activate our genes,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:10%
but we can modify our
gene expression just

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:10%
by the way we respond to
life and perceive the world.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in understanding
the new biology,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
let's learn a little bit
about the old biology,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:84%
or the existing, I should
say, biology, science.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean,
basically, we've all

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:84%
been programmed with the belief
that this DNA-- the story

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:84%
of DNA and the whole
history of DNA--

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
is a molecule that has the
blueprints for our lives built

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.510 align:middle line:84%
into it and that
we receive this DNA

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.805 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of conception.

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of our
life is really just

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:90%
an unfolding of the DNA.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.755 align:middle line:84%
So in one sense, your
life is essentially

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
preprogrammed in that belief
at the moment of conception.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it is just
unfolding the genes.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
That belief, of
course, has led us

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
into believing that we are
powerless in controlling

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.215 align:middle line:90%
our own health.

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That we are subject
to our genetic upbringing

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:90%
or our genetic code--

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that we have
to express that, right?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we find, oh,
my goodness, maybe our genes

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:84%
aren't operating correctly,
then all of a sudden,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.710 align:middle line:84%
we go outside of
ourselves and say,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not powerful enough
to take care of my health.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I really have to seek
a rescuer, someone

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
who is going to guide me, help
me, and bring my health in,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:84%
because I can't
manage my own health.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's the belief system
we've been brought up with.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.986 align:middle line:84%
But it's a totally
incorrect assumption.

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I get so
excited about talking

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.695 align:middle line:90%
about this new biology.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.194 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:18.653 align:middle line:84%
So let's learn a little bit
about the function of the cell.

00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:20.402 align:middle line:84%
We're going to empower
ourselves right now

00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:22.449 align:middle line:84%
to learn what's going
on inside our own body.

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's first
understand this.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
When we look in a mirror and
see ourselves in the mirror,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and we see a single
individual looking back-- you

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.938 align:middle line:84%
look in the mirror, and there's
that beautiful Lisa looking

00:03:30.938 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
back at yourself--
we see ourselves

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:90%
as single individuals.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:90%
That is a total misperception.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Because in truth,
we are actually

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
made out of about
50 trillion cells.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:90%
The cells are the living entity.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
A human, by full definition,
is a community of cells.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.227 align:middle line:84%
So when I say, Bruce, I'm really
speaking for 50 trillion cells.

00:03:52.227 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So now you say, well, what about
these cells inside your body?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well,
interestingly enough,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
average cell in your body,

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find a
very interesting fact,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.788 align:middle line:90%
and that is this.

00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, we look at a
human and I say, well--

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:84%
in a textbook of human
biology, I say, look

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
at all the human systems--
digestive, respiratory,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
excretory system, nervous
system, reproductive system, et

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
cetera, even immune
system-- and I say,

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
what's interesting is that
virtually every single cell

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
in our body has every one
of these systems in it.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
whatever we can do,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
we can only do it because
cells are doing it, OK?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Relevance, by definition, a cell
is a miniature human and that,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
in our body-- our body is a
community of 50 trillion cells.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is more or
less a government.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: If our government
is working in harmony

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
with the system, then
the 50 trillion cells

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:84%
work together and create health
and happiness in your body.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
If your government-- meaning
your mind, your thoughts,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs-- are not in harmony
with life or out of phase

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:84%
or out of sync with what's
going on in the world, then,

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
by definition, it alters
and fractures the community,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and we express disease
and ill health.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So basically, health is
harmony in the system,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and disease is when the
community begins to break down.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
We've had a tendency in our
history, blame the cells.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out,
oh, my goodness, no.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of
recognizing-- We have

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
to recognize our
responsibility in our thoughts

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:84%
is because the new
science reveals

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that our thoughts
actually control

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.705 align:middle line:90%
our genetics and our biology.

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're basically
just describing

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
our entire political
environment,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.659 align:middle line:84%
our entire environmental
crisis that we're

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:90%
going on with right now, right?

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.636 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what you said, the
microcosm versus the macrocosm.

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's not even
versus the macrocosm.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a microcosm and the
macrocosm are the same picture.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's because there
is an understanding

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that our world, nature,
is built on something

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:90%
called fractal geometry.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, well,
what the heck is that?

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, it's
a mathematics that

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
implies the existence
of as above, so below.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:84%
That is built in
to the mathematics.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:90%
The significance is--

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say, if you see
cells as miniature humans,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and you see how they work, well,
the information about how they

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
work and how they communicate
applies to us as humans,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.794 align:middle line:84%
because we're just a
cell made by cells.

00:06:07.794 --> 00:06:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's
take a look at this.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what the cell looks
like and the functions of it.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.081 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, interestingly enough,
we talk about single cells.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
cells as, like,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:90%
the amoebas and stuff like that.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.989 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, what
does a cell have?

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, it has all the functions.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:10%
I say, but what
creates the cell?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.635 align:middle line:10%
And what creates a cell is
things called proteins--

00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:25.285 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: --OK?

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And proteins are
the building blocks.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:10%
So if you want to build a
house, and you go to Home Depot,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.326 align:middle line:10%
and you've got all these
parts, and you collect

00:06:31.326 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:10%
all these parts, you
can build a house,

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.533 align:middle line:10%
and you build many
different versions.

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:35.930 align:middle line:10%
Proteins are similar to that.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:10%
They are the building blocks
that create the cell, OK?

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.215 align:middle line:10%
So basically, then,
your physical structure

00:06:41.215 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:10%
is determined by
your proteins, OK?

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:10%
And the proteins are
created from blueprints.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:10%
So the blueprints
are called the DNA.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:10%
That's the genetic code.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: That's
the genetic code,

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:10%
and it gives us these proteins.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's really interesting
about the proteins is

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that proteins-- each of about
the 150,000 different proteins

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that make up a
human-- each protein

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
has its own unique shape and
its own unique structure.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.186 align:middle line:84%
So as you assemble them, you get
all of the different variations

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:90%
of life from these proteins, OK?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But now comes, what's
the secret of life?

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And the secret of
life is that proteins

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:84%
are capable of changing
their shape, OK?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:10%
So while we have 150,000
different proteins,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:10%
each with their own
shape, it turns out

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:10%
that when this protein responds
to environmental information,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:10%
environmental signals, what's
going on in the environment.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Specific environmental
signals can

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:10%
alter the shape of a protein.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:10%
So what we talk
about is, A, there

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:10%
are proteins that
make up the body,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:10%
and, B, there are signals that
come from the environment.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:10%
When a signal
complements a protein,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:10%
it causes the protein
to change shape.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, ah, that's
the secret of life.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.674 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And that's what
we're taking a look at here

00:07:48.674 --> 00:07:49.424 align:middle line:10%
as it's happening?

00:07:49.424 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: Yeah, you're actually
watching proteins responding

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.799 align:middle line:10%
and changing from shape
A to shape B in response

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:10%
to environmental signals.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And how is this
the secret of life?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.411 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: Well, the
secret of life is this.

00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:10%
If proteins don't move,
then you are essentially

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:10%
a physical body, a
cadaver more or less.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.569 align:middle line:10%
A body, a cadaver, a dead
body's got all the proteins,

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:10%
got all the structure,
but there's no life.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.901 align:middle line:84%
I say, but where
does life come from?

00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:13.262 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fundamental
definition of life is movement.

00:08:13.262 --> 00:08:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I say, yeah, but where
does movement come from?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, proteins change
their shape, which is movement.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And what the cells do
is use the movement

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and harness the movement
to carry out the functions.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.619 align:middle line:84%
Respiration, digestion, muscle
contraction, for example,

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
is changing the
shape of the protein.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
So where does life come from?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Signals engaging with the
proteins changing the shape,

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.569 align:middle line:84%
and then the shape movement
is used to do work.

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's our
responses to the environment.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: To the environment.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Right.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.722 align:middle line:84%
If you cut off the response
to the environment,

00:08:45.722 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
so the cell doesn't
respond to the environment,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:90%
the proteins stop moving.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
A cell that cannot respond to
the environment is almost like

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:90%
a person that's comatose.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:84%
They're still alive,
but there's no behavior.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as our cells are
operating and replicating

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and replicating, the
environmental senses

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:84%
that come in with thoughts
or foods or other type

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.485 align:middle line:84%
of environmental factors
are what shape our cells?

00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:13.575 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, yeah, actually,
it's the environmental factors.

00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, as you
mentioned, it's

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:84%
a whole list of
environmental factors.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
There are physical factors,
such as the nutrition

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're eating.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:84%
But there are also energetic
factors, such as consciousness

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:84%
or what's going on in the
field-- electromagnetic fields.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Like cell phones are creating
electromagnetic fields,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:84%
which interact with
our proteins and can

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:90%
influence our own biology.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting to see
that we are responding

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to a whole network
of information

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
from the environment,
which includes

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:84%
both physical and
energetic components.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, you then have
to say, well, how

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:84%
does the cell organize
this behavior?

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Because without
organization, it would just

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.257 align:middle line:84%
be a bunch of stuff
moving around.

00:09:53.257 --> 00:09:54.298 align:middle line:90%
But it's all coordinated.

00:09:54.298 --> 00:09:54.865 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, there's
the equivalent of a brain.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And the equivalent of the
brain is the cell membrane.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's the cell's skin.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.175 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting,
because what I've talked about

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:10.005 align:middle line:84%
in relating a cell to a human is
that cells are, by definition,

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
miniature humans.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And the characteristic
and structure of the cells

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:90%
relate to our own.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Where we have
organs in our body,

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
the cell has miniature
organs called organelles, OK?

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because the membrane, or skin

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
of the cell, is the
equivalent of the brain.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
We used to think it was
the nucleus with the genes,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
because we'd say, oh,
genes control this,

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:90%
and genes control that.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:90%
But genes are blueprints.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
really have to get

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:90%
people to fully understand.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:84%
A blueprint has no
self-actualization.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.065 align:middle line:84%
It's just a piece
of information.

00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:42.387 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A flat blueprint.

00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: That's it.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.353 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:43.353 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.649 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And so, you say,
well, a gene turned on

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:46.565 align:middle line:90%
and a gene turned off.

00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:48.972 align:middle line:84%
And I say, do blueprints
turn on and turn off?

00:10:48.972 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is no,
they don't do that.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.385 align:middle line:90%
They're just information.

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not without
something to construct it.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: That's right.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So to make a
construction, you have

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.040 align:middle line:90%
blueprints, which are plans.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.165 align:middle line:90%
But you have a contractor--

00:10:59.165 --> 00:10:59.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:10:59.665 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --who selects the
blueprints and organizes how

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
they interact and build the
structure from the blueprints,

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.605 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:06.605 --> 00:11:09.005 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we are the
contractors of our cells?

00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, what it turns
out is the nervous system--

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.295 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:11:12.295 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: --is the contractor.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:90%
And how does it work?

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It reads those
environmental signals

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that are around us,
translates the signals

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
into biological information
which goes to the cells,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and then that information
controls the behavior.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So in our model of
the cell, for example,

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
if I add some new
chemistry, like hormones,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
to a culture dish, the chemistry
sort of rains on the cells.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.285 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And then
some of the hormones

00:11:37.285 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
stick to the cell's
surface, the skin.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And the skin, the membrane,
reads this information

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
through what are
called receptors.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And I go, again, well,
it's just like a human.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.117 align:middle line:84%
Our skin is actually the
source of our nervous system.

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:52.825 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
know from embryology.

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:54.075 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a giant membrane.

00:11:54.075 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's a
giant membrane, and it

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
has receptors--
eyes, ears, nose--

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and we read the environmental
signals through these receptors

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and then respond to these
signals with our behavior.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.200 align:middle line:84%
The cell, a miniature
version of that,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
has receptors built
into the membrane

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to read the
environmental signals.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And when the signals show
up at the cell membrane,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:84%
the cell membrane, just
like the nervous system,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:84%
distributes the signals
throughout the body

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:90%
of the cell.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And these signals, like I showed
in the last slide, when signals

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.866 align:middle line:84%
are sent into the
cell, the proteins

00:12:26.866 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and their complementary signals,
when they come together,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:90%
cause the proteins to move.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.375 align:middle line:84%
The movement generates
respiration, or digestion,

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:35.875 align:middle line:84%
or any of the
functions of the cell.

00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or replication.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Ah, that's the
important part, replication.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:90%
And it goes like this.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the signals
affect the proteins.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.950 align:middle line:84%
But then, you
might say, but what

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:84%
if I need a protein to
respond to a signal,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have that
protein in the cell?

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
next exciting part.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.077 align:middle line:84%
So he says, well, where
do you get the protein

00:12:53.077 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to make a response
to the environment?

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, the
DNA are the blueprints.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So the cell membrane sends
a signal in to the cell,

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
to the nucleus,
and then activates

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.445 align:middle line:90%
expression of the gene.

00:13:06.445 --> 00:13:08.486 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is that so relevant?

00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is very simple.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Is that the environmental signal
is what engages and activates

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:84%
the gene, not the gene
activating itself.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a whole
new field of science.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So just to let
people know, we're

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
moving beyond genetics
as a field of science.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And the new field of science
is called signal transduction.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a complicated name.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But what it says
is, can we follow

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.084 align:middle line:84%
how a signal from the
environment enters a cell

00:13:33.084 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:90%
and then engages a function?

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's signal transduction.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now this
could explain disease.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the Facebook
questions coming in

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:90%
is, how do you explain disease?

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have this gene,
you have this cell,

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:90%
that may have the cancer gene.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And it could lay dormant
for years and years

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:90%
and forever maybe.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.566 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Right.

00:13:49.566 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But then the outside
environmental signal that comes

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.956 align:middle line:84%
in could be stress, toxins,
food, negative thinking--

00:13:55.956 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --activates the gene?

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That's what
activates the gene.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you
say, well, somebody

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.327 align:middle line:84%
says I have a cancer
gene, I say, now, wait.

00:14:02.327 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
If you had a cancer gene,
then you should have a cancer.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.302 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, but when
we look at the statistics,

00:14:07.302 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
everybody that has
so-called cancer genes

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have cancer.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So then you have to ask the very
more important question about,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
well, how can I be-- you
know, possess a cancer gene

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:90%
and not have a cancer?

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.584 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, because the
gene doesn't activate itself.

00:14:20.584 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, let's
say, a doctor would say,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.999 align:middle line:84%
well, you have this
particular gene,

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:90%
and you have a propensity.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.164 align:middle line:84%
67% of the people
will express a cancer.

00:14:28.164 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, well,
that's interesting.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But I really want to know, the
33% that have this same gene

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and don't have the cancer,
that's more important.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.912 align:middle line:84%
Because it's what is
different in their life,

00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
because they have a
gene, but they're not

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:90%
effecting a disease with it.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out is it's not
the possession of the gene.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the response to
the environment that

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:84%
will send signals
to engage the gene.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so if you
have stress coming

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
into the environment, it
creates a cascading effects

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.065 align:middle line:90%
of chemicals--

00:14:59.065 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.619 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that then activate
the cancer and the gene.

00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, then it replicates
into cancer, right?

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.326 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Right.

00:15:05.326 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And this cascade of chemistry,
that goes from the environment

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.775 align:middle line:84%
to the gene, part of it
is signal transduction.

00:15:11.775 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
special part, where

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
the signal leaves the
cytoplasm of the cell

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:84%
but goes into the nucleus
where the genes are and affects

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
a heredity.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:84%
That's a new science
called epigenetics.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
revolution in science.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Because basically, it says this.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
What did we all learn in
school, and what did I

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
teach early on in
medical school?

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
It was something
called genetic control.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:84%
It simply means
control by genes.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
The new science with
signal transduction

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:90%
is called epigenetic control.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well,
what does that mean?

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I say, that
little epi, E-P-I--

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.952 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh, huh?

00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --it
really means above.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So if I say genetic control,
controlled by genes,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and I say epigenetic control,
it says control above the genes,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and now we're beginning to
recognize what really controls

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.697 align:middle line:84%
the genes is not the
genes, but the signals

00:16:01.697 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
from the environment
control the gene.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.447 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, when you were
teaching medical school--

00:16:05.447 --> 00:16:06.029 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes?

00:16:06.029 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and you were teaching
basically the old science,

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
according to you, were you
able to infuse these teachings

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
into what you were talking
about in your professor days?

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, it
was interesting.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when I started
out in my professor days,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I was a conventional
biologist, OK?

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But my research
was on stem cells.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And this was,
like, 45 years ago.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:16:27.285 --> 00:16:29.701 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So at that time,
there were just a handful of us

00:16:29.701 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
in the entire world
that even knew

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:90%
what a stem cell was really.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.526 align:middle line:84%
And a stem cell
is the equivalent

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
of an embryonic cell,
and it's in our bodies.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And all of us have stem cells.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is simply this.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Every day we lose
hundreds of billions

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.896 align:middle line:84%
of cells due to wear and tear
and normal aging processes,

00:16:46.896 --> 00:16:48.020 align:middle line:90%
and that becomes important.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It says, well, if you're
losing hundreds of billions

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:84%
of cells every day, how long
would it be before you're dead?

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:16:53.285 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And the
answer's, well, no.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Because we replace them.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I say,
well, then what's

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.463 align:middle line:84%
replacing all of these
cells that are dying?

00:16:59.463 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
these embryonic stem

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.382 align:middle line:84%
cells are providing
for all the new cells.

00:17:04.382 --> 00:17:06.215 align:middle line:84%
So all of us have stem
cells if we're alive.

00:17:06.215 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh, huh.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Because otherwise,
we wouldn't be alive.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a good start.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have a
certain amount, right?

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah, OK?

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.874 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
is, so what is

00:17:12.874 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:84%
it that controls
these stem cells?

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm teaching medical students
the conventional curriculum.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Yes, genes control
the fate of the cells.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I
am cloning stem cells.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:90%
And what does that really mean?

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, cloning stem cells means
I take one isolated stem cell

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and put it into a culture
dish all by itself.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And every 10 to 12
hours, a cell divides.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.522 align:middle line:90%
So I put in one cell.

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Then there's two.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Then's their four, eight.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And it doubles and doubles.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And after a week
or two, I've got

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:84%
thousands of cells
in the petri dish.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, that's
not the experiment.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:90%
That's just getting ready.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.735 align:middle line:84%
But what that means
is, what do I have?

00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I have thousands of
genetically identical cells,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
because they came
from one parent.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Every cell is just a
clone of the parent.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So I have thousands of
genetically identical cells.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Now I do the experiment.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:02.924 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: I take some of the
cells out of my culture dish

00:18:02.924 --> 00:18:04.465 align:middle line:84%
and put it into
another culture dish,

00:18:04.465 --> 00:18:05.673 align:middle line:90%
and I change the environment.

00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:06.945 align:middle line:90%
What do you change?

00:18:06.945 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the environment
is the culture medium.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.008 align:middle line:84%
And you have to recognize,
cells are like fish.

00:18:11.008 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:90%
They live in fluid.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.775 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
fish in an aquarium,

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:16.233 align:middle line:84%
you have to provide them with
food and the right pH and all

00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:16.355 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:18:16.355 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --pH in the environment.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So I adjust my culture
medium to feed the cells.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is I
make some minor changes

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:90%
in the chemistry of that.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:10%
And when I take some
cells out of my main dish,

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.575 align:middle line:10%
put them in this new dish--
let's call it environment A--

00:18:28.575 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: The cells form muscle.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: But here's
the experiment.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:10%
I go back to the original dish,
with the original stem cells,

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:10%
take some more out but
put them in petri dish

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:10%
B with a different
environment, environment B.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.460 align:middle line:10%
And in this dish,
they form bone.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:10%
And I go back, go get some more
cells out of the original dish,

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:10%
put it in dish C with a
different environment, C,

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:10%
and they form fat cells.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:10%
And then you're left with
a very simple question.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:10%
What controls the
fate of the cells?

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, the first thing is this.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:10%
They're all
genetically identical.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't the genes that made
the difference between bone,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:90%
muscle, and fat.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:90%
It was the environment.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting, here
I am teaching students genes

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
control life, and the
cells are teaching me.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
No, the cells learn,
that they respond

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
to the environmental information
and adjust their genes

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
to match the environment, OK?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.084 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the individual
cells in there,

00:19:25.084 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
although they came from
the same host, changed

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.245 align:middle line:90%
based on the environment.

00:19:28.245 --> 00:19:29.052 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:19:29.052 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
They were all genetically
identical, too.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So you can't say, oh,
genes made me become this,

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
or genes made me
become that, OK?

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.552 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's the outside
environment that changes it.

00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
interesting question

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.765 align:middle line:90%
coming in from Facebook.

00:19:40.765 --> 00:19:41.389 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah?

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: James says, how do you
explain that beliefs can change

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
certain parts of DNA, but
others it can't change,

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.569 align:middle line:84%
such as height, eye color,
those types of things?

00:19:51.569 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, that may
not be necessarily true.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know that
in multiple personalities,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that in personality A, a
person can have blue eyes,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and in personality B,
they can have grey eyes--

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Seriously?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah, seriously.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --and many
different changes.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
in personality A,

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.630 align:middle line:84%
a person may have an allergic
response to strawberries

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and then switch
to personality B,

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.735 align:middle line:84%
and a minute later, they
could eat strawberries

00:20:15.735 --> 00:20:16.860 align:middle line:90%
without any problem at all.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you could
effectively, with your mind,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.145 align:middle line:90%
control allergies?

00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Most allergies are
actually really associated

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:90%
with a mind aspect, as well.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.729 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
developmental part that we

00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:90%
can't get into right now.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right now,
right, but yes.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: But it's interesting.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:84%
There's an old story, like,
of a couple going out.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And the guy is in
love with this woman.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:90%
And she has a dog.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
the relationship.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And then they have a breakup.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And after the breakup,
the guy, all of a sudden,

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.135 align:middle line:90%
has an allergy to dogs.

00:20:48.135 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
He never had an allergy to dogs.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.333 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's a
psychological consequence

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.465 align:middle line:84%
of connecting the dog with
the relationship and the break

00:20:54.465 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:90%
of that relationship.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.449 align:middle line:84%
And the pathology of the
allergy is a reflection

00:20:58.449 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:84%
of the breaking of
that relationship.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
just another example

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:84%
of how the environment
affects the cells.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.122 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Oh, absolutely.

00:21:06.122 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I really like

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:84%
to get people to understand is,
I have a plastic dish of cells.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.975 align:middle line:84%
I put these cells in
a good environment,

00:21:12.975 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and they grow, and they
flourish, and they're healthy,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's really great.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, look,
just take the dish

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.248 align:middle line:84%
from the good environment
and move it over here

00:21:20.248 --> 00:21:21.300 align:middle line:90%
to a bad environment.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, what happens
is the cells start to get sick,

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and they begin to die.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I had a
specialist doctor

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:84%
who was a cell doctor in our
conventional world of health,

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.575 align:middle line:84%
he would look at my cells
in the sick culture.

00:21:34.575 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, oh, my
god, Bruce, your cells

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:90%
need some medicine, some drugs.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
go, absolutely not.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And the reason why is this.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
To bring health back to the
cells, I don't give them drugs.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.626 align:middle line:84%
All I do is take them
from the bad environment,

00:21:48.626 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
move them right back to
the good environment.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:84%
They will instantaneously
recover and become healthy

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The simple point is, since
the environment is influencing

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the genetic activity, a
healthy environment elicits

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:84%
a healthy response,
and an environment

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that's not in harmony
with our biology

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.246 align:middle line:84%
will elicit a
pathological response.

00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, so then why
do they give chemotherapy

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
to people who have cancer
with the cell replicating

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.120 align:middle line:84%
in its dysfunctional
state and dying?

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the
purpose of that?

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.171 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the
old belief system

00:22:21.171 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:90%
is, these cells are rogue cells.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Their genes went crazy.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:90%
And so we blame the genes.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:90%
We blame the cells.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And we say, kill the cells.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a
very terrible thing,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:84%
if you think about
it in this regard.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:90%
And that is this.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Chemotherapy kills
cells that are dividing.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, you live
every day because you

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
have stem cells that
have to divide to replace

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the hundreds of billions of
cells you lose every day.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:84%
When you give a
patient chemotherapy,

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
does the chemotherapy
distinguish

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.490 align:middle line:84%
between the necessary healthy
stem cells and the rogue cancer

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:90%
cells?

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when you are
doing chemotherapy,

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
not only are you killing
the cancer cells, which

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:84%
was the intention,
but you are also

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
debilitating the
individual, because you're

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:84%
killing their own
stem cells, which

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:90%
they need for their health.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So chemotherapy is not the
best approach to kill those.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, could you do it in
addition to what you're talking

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:84%
about in terms of changing the
environment with your thoughts,

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.960 align:middle line:84%
with your mental
health, with your food,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:90%
with different types of--

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: This is
what we're finding.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Here's a great story.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.604 align:middle line:84%
Dean Ornish, a
wonderful physician,

00:23:24.604 --> 00:23:27.020 align:middle line:84%
who has done a lot of research,
recently published a paper

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.944 align:middle line:84%
where he took prostate
cancer patients.

00:23:29.944 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:90%
And he took a group of them.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.515 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, for 90 days,
no drugs, no chemotherapy,

00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and none of this
stuff like this.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.560 align:middle line:84%
What are we going
to do for 90 days?

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:90%
We're going to change your diet.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give you
stress reduction techniques.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.546 align:middle line:84%
We're going to teach
you how to meditate,

00:23:43.546 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and gave them just
some lifestyle

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:90%
changes like that, right?

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:84%
The significance was in
90 days, 500 genes changed

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:90%
their function and their action.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And many of those
genes were related

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
to the development of
the prostate cancer.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.060 align:middle line:84%
What it had shown was, you
didn't have to give them drugs.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:84%
You just had to return them to
a more harmonious environment,

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
an environment that's
very supportive

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.860 align:middle line:90%
of their natural life state.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And the genes automatically
reverted back.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when your
doctor tells you to get rid

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.292 align:middle line:84%
of the stress in your life,
he's really trying to tell you,

00:24:15.292 --> 00:24:16.916 align:middle line:84%
this is the way of
healing essentially.

00:24:16.916 --> 00:24:18.041 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Well, absolutely.

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the American
Psychological Association

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:84%
has now revealed that up
to 90% of doctor visits

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:90%
are due to stress.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.161 align:middle line:84%
And it's the stress
that interferes with us.

00:24:27.161 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think, well,
my genes are causing my issues.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And it goes, well, you
know, let's correct

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:90%
a very important point here.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:90%
And that is this.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Less than 5% of the
people on this planet

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
arrived here with
genetic defects

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.529 align:middle line:84%
that would impact a negative
thing on their life, OK?

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Less than 5%.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that means
95% of the people

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.509 align:middle line:84%
don't have to necessarily
express their genetic makeup?

00:24:52.509 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Well, no.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
They express their
genetic makeup,

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:90%
but it's not pathological.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it's not.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.709 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:56.709 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: 95% of us got here
with a completely wonderful set

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
of genes to have a
healthy, happy existence.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, well,
I can understand the 5%,

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk about
them, because they still

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
can be influenced
in a different way.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.500 align:middle line:84%
But the 95% of the
people that start

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.708 align:middle line:84%
getting illness, and they
were the ones that got here

00:25:10.708 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:84%
with a healthy set of
genes, how can we start off

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:84%
by blaming the genes
as the problem?

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And now what we know is, not
only does the environment

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:84%
select the genes, through the
signals from the environment,

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:84%
but the environmental
signals can

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:90%
modify the reading of the gene.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's a number that
is, like, mind-boggling.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:84%
A gene is a blueprint
to make a protein, which

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:90%
is a building block of the body.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.746 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh, huh.

00:25:35.746 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Depending on how you
respond to the environment,

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
you can create
thousands of variations

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
of proteins from the
same gene blueprint

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.880 align:middle line:84%
just by the way you
respond to the environment.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And out of those
thousands, some of them

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:52.519 align:middle line:84%
might be good interpretations
of the gene blueprint,

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and some of them might be
pathological interpretations.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So when we talked about
cancer, 90% of cancer

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.550 align:middle line:90%
is not based on heredity.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:84%
90% of cancer is based on
having normal genes that,

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:84%
through environmental
interactions that are not

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
in harmony, are then reading
as a pathological gene.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not the gene that
caused the problem.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
also our perception

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.352 align:middle line:90%
of that particular event.

00:26:17.352 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
You could have
stress in your life.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
But your perception
of the stress

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.002 align:middle line:84%
affects the environment
of the gene.

00:26:24.002 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Of the genes, yeah.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going
to take a quick break.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.708 align:middle line:84%
But I want to come back
to that, because that's

00:26:28.708 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:90%
a huge teaching within itself.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bruce Lipton is my
guest, cellular biologist.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come back and
talk about why all of this

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
is important, and incredibly
important to the survival

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:90%
of our species.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:90%
This is Lisa Garr.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:10%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:26:43.920 --> 00:27:00.646 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:00.646 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, and my guest is
cellular biologist Dr. Bruce

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Lipton.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about how the
environment affects our cells.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.051 align:middle line:84%
And now this is a
great conversation

00:27:12.051 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
when it has to do
with a petri dish.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.929 align:middle line:84%
But how does this have to
do with us as human beings?

00:27:15.929 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.928 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we were
talking about is

00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:84%
when you take a
petri dish of cells

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and move it from
a good environment

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:84%
to a bad environment, they
get sick, and put them back,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:90%
they get healthy.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And what we really
have to also mention

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.530 align:middle line:90%
is what we discussed earlier.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:10%
A human is a community
of 50 trillion cells.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: So in
simple truth, a human

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:10%
is a skin-covered petri dish.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:10%
And we have culture medium
that's called blood.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.760 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: And why
is this relevant?

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.968 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't make a
difference whether the cell

00:27:39.968 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
is in a plastic
dish or a skin dish.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It responds to the composition
of the culture medium

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.180 align:middle line:90%
to determine its fate.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.750 align:middle line:90%
So I say, well, oh, OK.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does that mean now
in my skin-covered petri dish?

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, the blood
is the culture medium that

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:84%
affects the behavior
in genetics.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And I go, yeah, but what
controls the chemistry?

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.054 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
change the chemistry

00:28:00.054 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
of the medium in the petri dish,
I change the fate of the cells.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:10%
I go, ah, the brain.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:10%
And while I call myself a
cell biologist, all of us

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.875 align:middle line:10%
are, in truth, really what we
would call self biologists.

00:28:10.875 --> 00:28:11.375 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:13.795 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: Because all of us
are creating our own biology.

00:28:13.795 --> 00:28:15.295 align:middle line:10%
And I say, well,
how do you do that?

00:28:15.295 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:10%
And I say, when we perceive
something in the world,

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:10%
our mind makes an
interpretation.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:10%
And when it makes
an interpretation,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.040 align:middle line:10%
it sends chemistry of that
interpretation into the body,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.041 align:middle line:10%
through the blood, and
that's the culture medium

00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:30.498 align:middle line:10%
that controls the
fate of the cell.

00:28:30.498 --> 00:28:31.720 align:middle line:10%
So basically, I say, look.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:10%
Let's say you open up your eyes,
and you see someone you love,

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:84%
When you see someone
you love, then

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.090 align:middle line:84%
the brain releases some
wonderful chemistry

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:84%
into the blood, such
as oxytocin, dopamine,

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:90%
vasopressin, for example.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.563 align:middle line:84%
If I take those
chemicals, actually,

00:28:45.563 --> 00:28:47.146 align:middle line:84%
that are released
by the brain in love

00:28:47.146 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and put it in a culture
dish, a plastic dish,

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:90%
those cells grow beautifully.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the same reason
why when you are in love

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and you're releasing those
chemistry in your blood,

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and that blood is the culture
medium of your 50 trillion

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.369 align:middle line:84%
cells, that's why you feel so
healthy when you're in love

00:29:03.369 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:90%
and so vibrant and alive.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:04.951 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:29:04.951 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And I
say, yeah, but look.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.717 align:middle line:84%
Same brain, but
you open your eyes,

00:29:08.717 --> 00:29:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and you see something
that scares you.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Ah, well, in a
state of fear, you

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.330 align:middle line:84%
don't release the love
chemicals from the brain.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:84%
You start to release
other kinds of chemicals,

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.087 align:middle line:84%
like stress hormones,
cortisol, or histamine,

00:29:21.087 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:90%
or what we call cytokines.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of chemicals,
released into the blood,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:84%
prepare the cells
for fight or flight.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.357 align:middle line:90%
Get ready to protect yourself.

00:29:30.357 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the interesting
thing about that

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
is, if I take those
chemicals and put them

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.260 align:middle line:84%
into a plastic petri dish with
cells, my cells stop growing.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, doesn't it
suppress the immune system

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
other functions?

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is very simple.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.725 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're going to
be running away from a lion--

00:29:45.725 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, hm.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --you want
every bit of energy

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.555 align:middle line:84%
you can muster up to
get away from the lion.

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're saying, oh, yeah,
well, I have an immune system,

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.144 align:middle line:84%
and I'm fighting a
bacterial infection,

00:29:54.144 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like, who needs to
fight the bacterial infection?

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.070 align:middle line:90%
You're being chased by a lion.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you're under
stress, you actually--

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry that's
released shuts down

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.830 align:middle line:84%
the growth and
maintenance of the cells,

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:84%
shuts down the immune
system, to do what?

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Take that energy and conserve
it for running away and saving

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:90%
your life.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.070 align:middle line:84%
When you get out of stress,
then the normal chemistry

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.615 align:middle line:90%
comes back.

00:30:18.615 --> 00:30:21.086 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the cell
goes back towards growth.

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, in history, you
got chased by a lion.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.204 align:middle line:84%
If you got away, then
the lion's not there,

00:30:28.204 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:90%
and you go back into growth.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.395 align:middle line:84%
So stress was only used
in normal evolution

00:30:32.395 --> 00:30:34.955 align:middle line:84%
as just to run away
from that emergency.

00:30:34.955 --> 00:30:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at the world we

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.840 align:middle line:90%
live in today, 24/7, 365 stress.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stress.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That means
every day, we're

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.940 align:middle line:84%
releasing these hormones
into our body-- which

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.220 align:middle line:84%
are what-- diverting our
growth and repressing

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:84%
our immune system to
get us ready to run.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're always on a get
set, get ready to go.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:90%
But this cannot be sustained.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It was only meant to be used
to run away from that lion

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.972 align:middle line:90%
but not as a way of life.

00:31:01.972 --> 00:31:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at the population,

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you realize, well,
look at all the stress.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:90%
The kids are under stress.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:90%
The parents are under stress.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.470 align:middle line:84%
The communities
are under stress.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.672 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're in
a constant state

00:31:12.672 --> 00:31:13.880 align:middle line:90%
of suppressed immune systems.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.709 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Suppressing
the immune system.

00:31:15.709 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:84%
The more stress you're
under, the sicker you get.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the data comes
out, 90% of office visits

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.230 align:middle line:90%
are due to stress.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.525 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What does this look
like in terms of the DNA?

00:31:24.525 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:90%
How does this show up?

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, what happens
is the DNA is a blueprint.

00:31:29.055 --> 00:31:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And what's
really neat about this--

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.990 align:middle line:84%
because we always thought,
well, the blueprint, that's

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.480 align:middle line:84%
what you have, that's your
gene, that's what you have--

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.340 align:middle line:84%
but the new science of
epigenetics reveals, no, no.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.299 align:middle line:84%
Like a contractor, you
can give me a blueprint,

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and I can look at
it and say, oh, no,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I need to make a
change here, and I

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:84%
need to make a change here
to make it more adaptable.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, hm.

00:31:46.465 --> 00:31:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Epigenetics
is adaptability.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And so it says,
I can take a gene

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and modify the
readout of the gene

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to create thousands of
different versions of proteins

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.580 align:middle line:84%
from the same blueprint that
make the protein that best

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.090 align:middle line:90%
fits or adapts me.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I live in a
stressful environment,

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:84%
the proteins I'm
going to make are not

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:90%
for my health and harmony.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.570 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
for my protection.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.240 align:middle line:84%
That's different than growth,
because protection and growth

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:90%
aren't one and the same.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it
really tells us that we

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.650 align:middle line:84%
have to recognize that
stress is diverting

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.667 align:middle line:84%
our genetics from health
into something else.

00:32:19.667 --> 00:32:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's
a great question

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
coming in from Facebook, a
listener by the name of Kelly.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.806 align:middle line:84%
And she said she was
diagnosed with MS. Now,

00:32:27.806 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
what does she do with
this information?

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Now look, we're not doing
doctor diagnosis here.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.045 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting basic
science overview, OK?

00:32:36.045 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:37.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
a label like that.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: OK, here's
a basic understanding.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.855 align:middle line:84%
MS, by definition, is
called autoimmune disease.

00:32:42.855 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, that
sounds very medical,

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.106 align:middle line:90%
but what does it mean?

00:32:46.106 --> 00:32:47.480 align:middle line:84%
You translate
autoimmune disease,

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:90%
and it means self-destruction.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is, it
is your response to life

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.500 align:middle line:84%
that is ultimately
sabotaging your biology,

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
because your perceptions are
releasing chemistry that is not

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.120 align:middle line:84%
supporting health
but, in fact, creating

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.190 align:middle line:84%
a complement of
what you perceive.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is this relevant?

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Because in multiple sclerosis
cases, it finds out,

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.947 align:middle line:84%
well, doctors tell a patient,
oh, this is your fate.

00:33:12.947 --> 00:33:13.905 align:middle line:90%
This is your diagnosis.

00:33:13.905 --> 00:33:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is your label, yes.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: That's a belief.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.804 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And when
you take that belief

00:33:17.804 --> 00:33:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the system, you
manifest what the belief is,

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:21.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out, there
many patients with MS

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.210 align:middle line:84%
that say, I'm not
buying that story.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go out
and change my life,

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to change
my belief system,

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.395 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
change the way I live.

00:33:31.395 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And many of them have
made full recoveries, even

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
from the point where they
were in a wheelchair to later

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.460 align:middle line:90%
being free again.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And the whole idea was what?

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.227 align:middle line:84%
The MS is just a reflection
of self-destruction, chemistry

00:33:44.227 --> 00:33:45.560 align:middle line:90%
that is not supporting yourself.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.699 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you really
do that with the power

00:33:47.699 --> 00:33:48.740 align:middle line:90%
of your thoughts, really?

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.844 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
absolutely you can.

00:33:50.844 --> 00:33:52.302 align:middle line:84%
And I know so many
people who have.

00:33:52.302 --> 00:33:53.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's the exciting part.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine, Gary
Sinclair, was in a wheelchair

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and was actually getting
respiratory help.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And it hit him one day
that this is not my life.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And he changed his life.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.635 align:middle line:84%
He is now a
long-distance runner.

00:34:05.635 --> 00:34:06.635 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:34:06.635 --> 00:34:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.817 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And he has a website,
so, I mean-- Gary Sinclair.

00:34:09.817 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So it basically says,
you can do this.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.975 align:middle line:90%
And is this something novel?

00:34:12.975 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
Look, we talk about
something called the placebo.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.114 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh, huh.

00:34:17.114 --> 00:34:18.679 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: I say,
what's a placebo?

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a sugar pill,
but it makes people well.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I say, yeah, but why
does it make people well?

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:23.945 align:middle line:84%
It's like, because
they believe--

00:34:23.945 --> 00:34:25.145 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They can get well.

00:34:25.145 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --the pill is going
to be what's going to help them.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
it's a sugar pill.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.639 align:middle line:90%
They believe it.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So then they take
this pill, and then

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
they get well of very
many different things,

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.590 align:middle line:84%
from cancer to every other
kind of disease, and they get

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and then later find out
the pill didn't do it.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:90%
The pill was just a sugar pill.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.040 align:middle line:90%
And so why is that relevant?

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.034 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was, the healing
didn't come from the pill.

00:34:48.034 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:84%
The healing came from
the belief in the pill.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:51.904 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
the relevance is,

00:34:51.904 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:84%
factually, one third
of all healings

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:58.070 align:middle line:84%
in the medical profession,
drug or surgery-related,

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.080 align:middle line:84%
are all due to the
belief of the patient,

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.660 align:middle line:84%
not due to the technique or
the chemistry of the drugs.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.367 align:middle line:84%
And while we talk
about placebos--

00:35:05.367 --> 00:35:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really, one third?

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: One third.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a given fact of science.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.804 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a very high number.

00:35:09.804 --> 00:35:10.428 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:35:10.428 --> 00:35:11.570 align:middle line:90%
But here is the other part.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Because while we focus
on the positive aspect

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.730 align:middle line:84%
of a positive belief
from a placebo pill,

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.870 align:middle line:84%
we ignore the other
valuable part.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.000 align:middle line:90%
And that is this.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000 align:middle line:90%
What about a negative belief?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, oh, my god,
there is a science of that.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It's called the nocebo effect.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And what does it show?

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:34.060 align:middle line:84%
A negative belief is equally
powerful in regulating the body

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.950 align:middle line:84%
but works in the
opposite direction.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So while a positive belief
can create a placebo healing,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
a negative belief
actually can cause someone

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:84%
to die or create a
disease, because they

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.889 align:middle line:90%
have the belief in the disease.

00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is called
the nocebo effect.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Nobody talks about it.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But to me, while the
placebo is important,

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.980 align:middle line:84%
it's more important to recognize
your negative thoughts.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Your belief that's not very
positive is equally powerful

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.890 align:middle line:84%
but works in the
opposite direction.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do
you turn this around?

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:84%
How do you change this
entire environment around you

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.309 align:middle line:84%
to replicate positive--
or replicate healthy cells

00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:90%
I should say.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
you have to start

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.830 align:middle line:84%
being conscious of
what your thoughts are.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And as psychologists tell
us, 70% of our thoughts

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:90%
are negative and redundant.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I have
negative thoughts,

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I can give you the
biophysiology of that.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Your negative thoughts
are releasing chemistry

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.420 align:middle line:84%
that complement a
negative thought.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.885 align:middle line:84%
Cells become a complement
to the perception.

00:36:28.885 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it as simple
as changing our thoughts?

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely, it is.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.346 align:middle line:84%
And then people say, oh,
yeah, well that sounds easy,

00:36:35.346 --> 00:36:35.570 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sounds easy.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.023 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it does.

00:36:37.023 --> 00:36:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And then
it says, oh, come on.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Can my belief do that?

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If that
would be the case,

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:43.455 align:middle line:84%
then we would all
be healthy, yes.

00:36:43.455 --> 00:36:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
something that most people

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.655 align:middle line:84%
in the audience have
experienced at one time.

00:36:47.655 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is, at one
time, most of us

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.040 align:middle line:84%
have fallen head
over heels in love.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.072 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to
understand something.

00:36:54.072 --> 00:36:56.030 align:middle line:84%
When they have fallen
head over heels in love--

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.446 align:middle line:84%
and I ask this of
audiences, and I

00:36:57.446 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:84%
love their responses-- I said,
when you go back to that time

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.430 align:middle line:84%
you were head over heels
in love, were you healthy?

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And almost everybody, oh, yes,
I was exuberantly healthy.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It was so vital.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.576 align:middle line:90%
I was so great.

00:37:06.576 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I say, did you have energy?

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the joke is,
of course, you probably

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.730 align:middle line:84%
made love for days without
stopping for food or sleep,

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:90%
and you had tremendous energy.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And I go, also, go back to what
I call the honeymoon effect.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And I say, was life so
beautiful that you couldn't

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.730 align:middle line:84%
wait for the next
day to have more?

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And everyone says,
yes, yes, yes.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And I go, that was
not an accident.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:90%
That was a creation.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.130 align:middle line:90%
You did that.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And how did you do that?

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
you actually started

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:middle line:84%
operating from what we
call the conscious mind

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and not operating from
the subconscious mind.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the whole
difference of whether we're

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.190 align:middle line:84%
going to be healthy
or sick emanates from,

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.560 align:middle line:90%
these two different minds.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.467 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we can
create this feeling?

00:37:52.467 --> 00:37:54.050 align:middle line:84%
If we did it once,
we can do it again.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Is basically that's
what you're saying?

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: You can do it anytime.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:90%
You can make it a way of life.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.597 align:middle line:90%
You have to find out.

00:37:58.597 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:84%
How did I create the honeymoon
effect, and how come I lost it?

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.956 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is very simple.

00:38:02.956 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:84%
There are two minds,
conscious, subconscious.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Conscious mind is
connected to your spirit,

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:90%
your personal identity.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.100 align:middle line:90%
That's who you are.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.680 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind
is a creative mind.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:84%
It has-- If I asked
you, I say, Lisa,

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.470 align:middle line:84%
what do you want
out of your life?

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can create an answer.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.810 align:middle line:84%
That comes from
the conscious mind.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.136 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And then I
also tell you this.

00:38:21.136 --> 00:38:23.665 align:middle line:84%
A conscious mind doesn't always
stay in the present moment.

00:38:23.665 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind--
I could say, Lisa,

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.330 align:middle line:90%
what's happening next week?

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
think next week.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.850 align:middle line:84%
You're into the
future, creating.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh, huh.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: I say, what
happened last week?

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.215 align:middle line:84%
And your mind
could go backwards.

00:38:32.215 --> 00:38:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And I could ask you to solve
a math problem in your head.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.137 align:middle line:84%
Your conscious
mind can disconnect

00:38:37.137 --> 00:38:38.720 align:middle line:84%
from our conversation
and go up there.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.406 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:39.406 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Point.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.833 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind is not
always running the show.

00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:43.184 align:middle line:90%
The conscious mind's thinking.

00:38:43.184 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the issue is if the
conscious mind's thinking,

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:46.880 align:middle line:90%
it's not paying attention.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.180 align:middle line:84%
The default is the
subconscious habits.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And then I go, ah.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:84%
The issue is this, that
the fundamental habits

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.080 align:middle line:84%
in the subconscious
mind are not even ours.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:84%
They came from the first six
years of our development.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And the brain was
in a state called

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.010 align:middle line:84%
theta, which is an EEG state,
which, for children, is

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.937 align:middle line:84%
recognized as a
state of imagination.

00:39:09.937 --> 00:39:11.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
what we see, children

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:84%
mixing the real and
the imaginary world.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.335 align:middle line:84%
But more than that,
theta is hypnosis.

00:39:15.335 --> 00:39:16.276 align:middle line:90%
What's the relevance?

00:39:16.276 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, it's a
learning state, yes.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Six years, you
learn about the world.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.379 align:middle line:90%
By how?

00:39:20.379 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:90%
By observing it.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.419 align:middle line:90%
But who do you observe?

00:39:22.419 --> 00:39:23.585 align:middle line:90%
Other people, your parents--

00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --your
family and community.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.005 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
constantly modeling.

00:39:26.005 --> 00:39:28.046 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: You're modeling,
as you are downloading

00:39:28.046 --> 00:39:29.880 align:middle line:84%
through hypnosis,
their behavior.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So I say, your conscious mind
is you and your creativity

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and your wishes and desires.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
mind, the programs

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.960 align:middle line:84%
you acquired during
the first six years

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:84%
by observing your community,
your family, et cetera.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.785 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, hm.

00:39:42.785 --> 00:39:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: So relevance?

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Science has now revealed
this most amazing fact.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.880 align:middle line:84%
We only operate
our lives about 5%

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.940 align:middle line:84%
of the time with our
conscious, creative mind.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that has
positive thinking, as well, OK?

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the one that can
create the positive thoughts.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That's the
one that creates,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and that's where positive
thinking comes from.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But it only operates
5% of the time.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.756 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the
time, it's thinking.

00:40:03.756 --> 00:40:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And if it's thinking,
it's not paying attention.

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:09.552 align:middle line:84%
So 95% of the time, we
shift to the default,

00:40:09.552 --> 00:40:11.135 align:middle line:84%
which is called the
subconscious mind.

00:40:11.135 --> 00:40:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's constantly
defaulting to the subconscious

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.550 align:middle line:84%
programming that we learned
from zero to six years old.

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.508 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Other people.

00:40:16.508 --> 00:40:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So the behavior when you're not
paying attention is not yours.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It's your family's behavior,
your culture's behavior.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And what people have
to really recognize

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:84%
is, subconscious by its nature
means below consciousness.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Relevance?

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.410 align:middle line:84%
When you shift into
the subconscious,

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.500 align:middle line:84%
it happens below your
level of awareness.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.540 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So as I like to
tell in my lectures,

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.554 align:middle line:90%
I say, go back in your past.

00:40:37.554 --> 00:40:39.220 align:middle line:84%
You had a friend you
were very close to.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:39.960 align:middle line:90%
You knew your friend's behavior.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.749 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And you happen to
know your friend's parent.

00:40:42.749 --> 00:40:44.882 align:middle line:84%
And you happened to see
that your friend shared

00:40:44.882 --> 00:40:46.840 align:middle line:84%
some of the same behavior
as their parents did.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: You know, one day you
casually say to your friend,

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.670 align:middle line:84%
hey, you know, Bill,
you're just like your dad.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.072 align:middle line:84%
And then you back
away from Bill.

00:40:53.072 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Because Bill's the first guy.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.610 align:middle line:84%
He goes, like, how can
you compare me to my dad?

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:57.815 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:57.815 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: And joke is this.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else can see that
Bill behaves like his dad.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.780 align:middle line:84%
The only one who
doesn't see it is Bill.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:04.946 align:middle line:90%
Where'd he get the behavior?

00:41:04.946 --> 00:41:06.530 align:middle line:90%
First six years of programming.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Why doesn't he see it?

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Because his mind is
thinking, and he's

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.070 align:middle line:90%
playing the default program.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.680 align:middle line:90%
All of us are Bill.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.720 align:middle line:90%
All of us do this every day.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the issue
is, well, how come

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.070 align:middle line:84%
our positive thinking isn't
creating that honeymoon

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:21.740 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
because we're only

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
using it 5% of the
time in a normal day.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.197 align:middle line:84%
But science revealed
something interesting

00:41:28.197 --> 00:41:29.030 align:middle line:90%
about the honeymoon.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the one time in your
life where you essentially

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.160 align:middle line:90%
operate strictly--

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From the conscious mind.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --from
the conscious mind.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:36.726 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank God.

00:41:36.726 --> 00:41:39.151 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important to
go back to that reference.

00:41:39.151 --> 00:41:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That
reference, because it

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:41.480 align:middle line:90%
says, you did this once.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.146 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:41:42.146 --> 00:41:45.080 align:middle line:84%
You created love, and you
created heaven on Earth.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, why did the
honeymoon go away?

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, because,
inevitably, life still

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:51.720 align:middle line:90%
gets busy, and you or--

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --your partner's
conscious presence

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:56.950 align:middle line:84%
starts to drift as you
start thinking about,

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.742 align:middle line:84%
oh, I got to pay the
rent or fix the car.

00:41:58.742 --> 00:42:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The stressors
come in, yes.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: The stressors come in.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.700 align:middle line:84%
You shift from conscious,
you know, conscious focus--

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you change.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --and then the
subconscious kicks in.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, the subconscious, when it
kicks in, isn't your behavior.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the behavior of
your family or community.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when you're in
this honeymoon and everything's

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:84%
so wonderful, and
then one day, you

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.530 align:middle line:84%
ask a simple question
of your spouse,

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
this, like, response.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.315 align:middle line:84%
And you say to your
spouse, who are you?

00:42:23.315 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.842 align:middle line:84%
Because the
subconscious behavior

00:42:25.842 --> 00:42:27.300 align:middle line:84%
hadn't played up
until this moment.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It just begins
playing when the mind goes busy.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
you see the honeymoon-- which

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.400 align:middle line:84%
was just two conscious
minds creatively creating

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.260 align:middle line:84%
their wishes and desires,
making heaven on Earth--

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.990 align:middle line:84%
starts to fade when the
subconscious programs start

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:45.820 align:middle line:84%
taking more of the percentage,
bringing in behaviors that

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.470 align:middle line:84%
are not ours, that they there
are other people's behaviors.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
necessarily good behaviors.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So staying in the
honeymoon phase requires

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.770 align:middle line:84%
us to constantly create
that willfully in a place,

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.380 align:middle line:84%
disregarding the
stressors that come in,

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.216 align:middle line:84%
and staying in, I guess, a state
of present tense, as you say,

00:43:01.216 --> 00:43:01.715 align:middle line:90%
mindfulness.

00:43:01.715 --> 00:43:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Mindfulness.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.885 align:middle line:84%
And this is the whole practice
of, like, Buddhist meditations.

00:43:04.885 --> 00:43:05.326 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, hm.

00:43:05.326 --> 00:43:06.701 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's
the idea of, look,

00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:09.100 align:middle line:84%
if you stay in control with
your conscious mind, then

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:84%
every decision you make is your
decision, based on your wishes

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.010 align:middle line:90%
and desires.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:84%
The moment your conscious mind
starts thinking and leaves

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.840 align:middle line:84%
control to the subconscious,
well, every decision

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.712 align:middle line:84%
then is based on
the program that you

00:43:21.712 --> 00:43:23.670 align:middle line:84%
got from other people,
which is not necessarily

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:24.750 align:middle line:90%
what you wanted in your life.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is a
great question that's

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.460 align:middle line:84%
coming in from one of
our Facebook people.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.335 align:middle line:84%
And we lit up a lot of
the parents out there.

00:43:29.335 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So Casey is saying that she
has a four-year-old daughter.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And how can she keep
her safe but not

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:84%
instill beliefs-- like,
don't climb that tree,

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to fall, or don't
take candy from strangers,

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:42.740 align:middle line:84%
things like that-- how
do you ride that fence?

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
basically, a child

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.480 align:middle line:84%
will pattern
themselves after you.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's unfortunate,
because that's

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.070 align:middle line:90%
where the problems come from.

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Because when you look at
ourselves, we say, yeah, well,

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:53.451 align:middle line:90%
this is who I want to be.

00:43:53.451 --> 00:43:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But then, unknowingly,
I'm playing

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.400 align:middle line:90%
95% of somebody else's program.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, do what
I say, not what I do.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So a
child is picking up

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.260 align:middle line:84%
all of the things
that you're not

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.700 align:middle line:84%
watching and still
recording them.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why behaviors
are passed from generation

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.470 align:middle line:90%
to generation.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:90%
They are recorded by the child.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.710 align:middle line:84%
The recording is on
100% of the time,

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:11.362 align:middle line:84%
but you're only
on 5% of the time

00:44:11.362 --> 00:44:12.570 align:middle line:90%
regarding your consciousness.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So to break that
pattern, you have to willfully

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and intentionally and
mindfully break the pattern.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That's called
being a conscious parent.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And that's
the whole idea

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:23.590 align:middle line:84%
is because if you know your
child's patterning you,

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.810 align:middle line:84%
then what you have to do
is live the life that you

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:26.810 align:middle line:90%
want your child to live.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in terms of
genetics, if you want to break

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:84%
the genetic, I guess,
pattern of obesity--

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.945 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:44:33.945 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You would have to
willfully and consciously make

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.590 align:middle line:84%
choices for the right types
of food and the right type

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of exercise and
to really shift--

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --to
recognize that what

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.030 align:middle line:84%
your engagement in
the environment is,

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:47.310 align:middle line:90%
is controlling your biology.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.720 align:middle line:84%
If you put garbage in, you
get garbage back out again.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.096 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
gene for obesity.

00:44:52.096 --> 00:44:53.428 align:middle line:90%
That's a behavioral consequence.

00:44:53.428 --> 00:44:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.993 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: See?

00:44:54.993 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's the idea was how
do I sublimate my anxiety?

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And, well, how did
your family do it?

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.080 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So most of the
genetic expressions

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.780 align:middle line:10%
are a reaction to
our environment.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: 5% of the
defects in genetics

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.090 align:middle line:90%
are due to the birth defects.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:13.637 align:middle line:90%
95% are acquired defects--

00:45:13.637 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --are learned behaviors.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.678 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --learned
from our experiences.

00:45:16.678 --> 00:45:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So anxiety?

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Oh, absolutely.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Learned behavior.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.651 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: How did your parents
deal with their anxiety?

00:45:21.651 --> 00:45:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Did they fret?

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.435 align:middle line:84%
Did they get
anxious and nervous?

00:45:24.435 --> 00:45:25.595 align:middle line:90%
Then you would do the same.

00:45:25.595 --> 00:45:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is anxiety genetic?

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: No, it's learned.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes, it's learned.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety means I'm not
dealing with the environment

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.232 align:middle line:84%
appropriately or effectively
to create what I want.

00:45:37.232 --> 00:45:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So, well, wait.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.710 align:middle line:84%
If a father had anxiety as a
child, and then the child--

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:84%
he has a child, and
that child has anxiety

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.389 align:middle line:84%
but never knew the father with
the anxiety at that level,

00:45:46.389 --> 00:45:47.180 align:middle line:90%
how does that work?

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: The anxiety
was programmed in there

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:50.320 align:middle line:84%
in the first six years
of the child's life--

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --in some way.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.448 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --just by
observing the parent.

00:45:52.448 --> 00:45:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's give a critical piece
of data that, if you see it,

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.600 align:middle line:90%
then it's like, oh!

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It goes like this.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:04.240 align:middle line:84%
A child adopted into a family
that has a lineage of cancer

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.650 align:middle line:84%
will get the same family cancer
with the same propensity as any

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of the natural genetic
siblings, yet the child

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.536 align:middle line:84%
comes from totally
different genetics.

00:46:13.536 --> 00:46:14.410 align:middle line:90%
And what's the point?

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:17.330 align:middle line:84%
The point was, the cancer
didn't come from the genes.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.030 align:middle line:84%
The cancer came
from the inability--

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.113 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --the environment.

00:46:20.113 --> 00:46:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --to live in harmony
with the world, to hold anger.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is inability to
express anger or frustration.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:32.175 align:middle line:84%
This is what leads to chemistry
of causing the cells to engage

00:46:32.175 --> 00:46:33.700 align:middle line:84%
in inappropriate
genetic activity.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.074 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You actually have a
slide that shows an animation

00:46:36.074 --> 00:46:39.860 align:middle line:84%
of how this happens, right, how
the RNA comes in, and it splits

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.480 align:middle line:90%
off, and the whole idea of it--

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON:Well, basically,
when we look at a chromosome,

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.720 align:middle line:90%
a chromosome is like my arm.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.350 align:middle line:84%
It has a core of DNA, my arm,
with a sleeve of protein.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: DNA is a blueprint.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.827 align:middle line:84%
And it says, if you
want to read a gene,

00:46:54.827 --> 00:46:55.910 align:middle line:90%
you need to read the gene.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I have a sleeve over
it, I can't read the gene.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:59.489 align:middle line:84%
So what it basically
shows is this.

00:46:59.489 --> 00:47:00.779 align:middle line:90%
A signal from the environment--

00:47:00.779 --> 00:47:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.434 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --causes the
protein to change shape.

00:47:03.434 --> 00:47:04.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what we talked about.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And when the
protein changes shape,

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.350 align:middle line:84%
the proteins come
off the chromosome.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.190 align:middle line:90%
The DNA is now exposed.

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Once the DNA is exposed, the
cell makes a copy of the DNA,

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:16.190 align:middle line:90%
and that's called RNA.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
blueprint used to make

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.570 align:middle line:90%
the building blocks of the body.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Once I have the RNA,
I don't need the DNA.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So the signal detaches,
and the gene is covered up.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So when I say, the
gene was activated,

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.085 align:middle line:90%
I say, what did the gene do?

00:47:28.085 --> 00:47:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the animation,

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.830 align:middle line:90%
the gene didn't do anything.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:31.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a blueprint.

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.060 align:middle line:84%
It's being, like, Xerox
copied by this protein.

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Xerox is called RNA,
and that's the blueprint

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:38.850 align:middle line:90%
that you work with.

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But the gene itself
didn't do anything.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So basically, that's
one part of epigenetics,

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.130 align:middle line:84%
selecting the genes
and doing that.

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But the second
part of epigenetics

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.516 align:middle line:90%
is a little different.

00:47:47.516 --> 00:47:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And the second part of
epigenetics is this.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Is that not only can
you select the gene,

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.910 align:middle line:84%
but the environmental
information,

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.300 align:middle line:84%
as translated by the
chemistry from the brain,

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.640 align:middle line:84%
can modify the
readout of the gene.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't change
the genetic code.

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:04.570 align:middle line:90%
But it's like scissors and tape.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Take a gene blueprint,
cut it up in pieces,

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and retape it in a
different sequence.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the same gene, but now it's
reading a different program.

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is how a normal,
healthy gene can lead to cancer

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:21.230 align:middle line:84%
by the chemistry in the body
that's going to adapt that gene

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:84%
to compensate or complement
the environment that we're in.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So stress can be
perceived two different ways,

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.200 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.570 align:middle line:84%
You can have stress
in your life.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:31.195 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:48:31.195 --> 00:48:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But if you perceive
it as devastating stress,

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.805 align:middle line:90%
it will cause that exact thing.

00:48:36.805 --> 00:48:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It will cause degeneration.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:38.596 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Right.

00:48:38.596 --> 00:48:41.641 align:middle line:84%
Because once you perceive it
and interpret this as stress,

00:48:41.641 --> 00:48:44.140 align:middle line:84%
then the nature of the system
is to release stress hormones.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, hm.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:45.948 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
the stress hormones

00:48:45.948 --> 00:48:48.500 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that activate
or inhibit the genes

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and change the genes
and do all this.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.395 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically,
this is why stress

00:48:52.395 --> 00:48:53.970 align:middle line:90%
is the cause of most illness.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:57.500 align:middle line:84%
As I said, 95% of us got here
with a perfectly adequate set

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of genes for a
healthy, happy life.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.939 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yet 90% percent of
disease is caused by stress.

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And that's
exactly what it's all about.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:04.647 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:49:04.647 --> 00:49:06.688 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And stress is
just your interpretation.

00:49:06.688 --> 00:49:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, interesting.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So the concept of
all of these new age things

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.060 align:middle line:84%
are actually founded in
the science of saying what?

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, eat
better nutrition.

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:84%
You are reducing the
environmental stress

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:24.060 align:middle line:84%
on the system and
allowing the system

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.250 align:middle line:84%
to work in its normal
harmony the way

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:27.670 align:middle line:90%
it does to promote health.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can basically
chunk this entire thing up

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.547 align:middle line:84%
to the conversation
of our environment.

00:49:32.547 --> 00:49:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
that's the whole idea.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:35.046 align:middle line:90%
It's just what I said.

00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Look, I put cells
in the petri dish.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.580 align:middle line:84%
The fate of the cells is
not based on the genetics

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.450 align:middle line:90%
that I put in there.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:41.990 align:middle line:90%
It's based on the environment.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.210 align:middle line:90%
I change the environment.

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:45.650 align:middle line:84%
A healthy environment, the
cells grow beautifully.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.210 align:middle line:84%
An unhealthy environment,
they get sick and die.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:49.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's so simple.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And so basically it
says, yeah, but you

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.940 align:middle line:90%
are the skin-covered petri dish.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And are you putting in good
chemistry in your culture

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.630 align:middle line:90%
medium or bad chemistry?

00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:59.088 align:middle line:84%
Well, I say, what
are you thinking?

00:49:59.088 --> 00:49:59.886 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:49:59.886 --> 00:50:01.511 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That's what
it comes down to.

00:50:01.511 --> 00:50:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is really, truly
that the biggest impact that

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bruce Lipton has
made to our community,

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.080 align:middle line:84%
is how our thoughts and the
perception of our environment--

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.230 align:middle line:84%
not only environment,
but the perception,

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:16.160 align:middle line:84%
how we perceive what
is going on around us--

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.680 align:middle line:84%
directly impacts the growth
of healthy cells or the--

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: --expression--

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.945 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --the degeneration
of unhealthy cells.

00:50:22.945 --> 00:50:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's really very
important to recognize this.

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Our perception or interpretation
of the environment

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.430 align:middle line:84%
does not necessarily have
to match the environment.

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.480 align:middle line:84%
You could live in a
perfectly healthy environment

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.286 align:middle line:84%
but have a fear, and
the fear that something

00:50:36.286 --> 00:50:37.160 align:middle line:90%
is going to go wrong.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not out there.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.600 align:middle line:90%
But the fear, itself--

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Do the cells see the
thing that's out there?

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:42.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.710 align:middle line:84%
The cells see what
the brain thinks.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, hm.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.690 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: So while you may
live in a perfectly healthy

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.040 align:middle line:10%
environment, if
the brain perceives

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.420 align:middle line:10%
that it's a negative
environment,

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.760 align:middle line:10%
or you're under some stress,
or you're under some pressure,

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.070 align:middle line:10%
the cells only see what the
brain interpreted, because it's

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:01.500 align:middle line:10%
the brain's chemistry
that the cells read.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.340 align:middle line:10%
If the cells could--

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.570 align:middle line:10%
Here's an interesting point.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.460 align:middle line:10%
I work with muscular dystrophy
patients, cloning their cells.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:11.030 align:middle line:10%
In the body, their muscle stem
cells didn't work very well,

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:12.520 align:middle line:10%
and they had muscular dystrophy.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.100 align:middle line:10%
But when I took their stem
cells out of their body

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.350 align:middle line:10%
and put it into a petri dish
with a good environment--

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:17.750 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: They worked?

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.166 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: They
worked beautifully,

00:51:19.166 --> 00:51:20.030 align:middle line:90%
and they grew well.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:23.560 align:middle line:84%
What was the issue was,
in a bad environment,

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.600 align:middle line:84%
the cells weren't able
to compensate and be OK.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.450 align:middle line:84%
But take them out of
the bad environment,

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:29.090 align:middle line:90%
and they were healthy.

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:30.462 align:middle line:90%
So we've been blaming the cells.

00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The bad environment,
though, in that person's body,

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.794 align:middle line:84%
would be a cascading effect
of chemicals in the body

00:51:35.794 --> 00:51:36.710 align:middle line:90%
that caused that then?

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Yeah, and
activation of this.

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:40.287 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
epigenetics can

00:51:40.287 --> 00:51:41.620 align:middle line:90%
modify the readout of the genes.

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It can take a normal, healthy
gene and make it cause cancer.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But as epigenetics research
also revealed-- revealed it,

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.530 align:middle line:84%
very interesting, you can
start with a mutant gene.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the right
environment, the mutant gene

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.040 align:middle line:90%
will read as a normal gene.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You see, the claim that
you're making here is huge.

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically,
are you saying

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.977 align:middle line:84%
that you can reverse
muscular dystrophy?

00:52:04.977 --> 00:52:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: That these
issues have been shown.

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But the issue is, it's
based on the belief system.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:11.080 align:middle line:90%
So the idea is this.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:11.670 align:middle line:90%
I go in.

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm a patient.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we learned as
children is very important.

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Remember, our
programming as children

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.850 align:middle line:90%
determine how we respond.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:20.370 align:middle line:90%
What did we learn as children?

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Our health isn't in our hands.

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Our health is in the hands
of the medical profession--

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, hm.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:24.848 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: --number one.

00:52:24.848 --> 00:52:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Number two, we're
not professionals

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:29.101 align:middle line:84%
about certain things,
and other people are.

00:52:29.101 --> 00:52:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm not a professional,
the professional opinion

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.114 align:middle line:90%
becomes truth.

00:52:32.114 --> 00:52:33.530 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's
relevant, that it

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:37.170 align:middle line:84%
says, if you get a diagnosis
that, like, you have a terminal

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:40.230 align:middle line:84%
illness, and your
belief system is

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.100 align:middle line:84%
the doctor is the
truth provider--

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.489 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --then whatever the
doctor said becomes your truth.

00:52:45.489 --> 00:52:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you can predict
when a patient's going to die,

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:49.185 align:middle line:84%
because you
essentially tell them

00:52:49.185 --> 00:52:50.090 align:middle line:84%
when they were going
to die, you know?

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And all of this
has been demonstrated

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:55.400 align:middle line:84%
through the concept
of placebo/nocebo.

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.070 align:middle line:84%
A negative diagnosis
is, by definition,

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:01.419 align:middle line:84%
a nocebo effect, yeah,
a negative belief.

00:53:01.419 --> 00:53:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I've already, you
know, mentioned it.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Many times, yeah.

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: But it's
a fact of science.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, hm.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: A nocebo
belief can kill you.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It can cause all the
diseases that we have.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're really taught
that our healing is outside

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.220 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, that we're
powerless against our own

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:17.510 align:middle line:84%
genetics, and that we don't have
an option in our own healing.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And what you're saying--
what the field of epigenetics

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:22.550 align:middle line:84%
is saying, and you are so
wonderfully expressing today--

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:26.310 align:middle line:84%
is that we can control the
expression of those genes.

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.640 align:middle line:84%
We can turn them on and
off with the perceptions

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.885 align:middle line:90%
of our environment.

00:53:29.885 --> 00:53:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: This is an exact
fact, and it's an exact truth.

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And why is this relevant?

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's time for us to
rewrite the negative beliefs

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that come with our
own health issues.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if we
manifest an expression

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.990 align:middle line:84%
from our negative
beliefs, then we're

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:46.990 align:middle line:84%
going to manifest a negative
expression, and that's nocebo.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:49.907 align:middle line:84%
And yet, hey, the same person
could have a placebo belief,

00:53:49.907 --> 00:53:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and, all of a sudden,
it goes the other way.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.073 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So all of the Facebook
questions that are coming

00:53:54.073 --> 00:53:56.520 align:middle line:84%
in, saying I'm stressed out
at work, I'm uninspired,

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.120 align:middle line:90%
all of that--

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.405 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --is basically
reinforcing the negativity--

00:53:59.405 --> 00:54:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:02.394 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and turning on those
genetic markers if they are

00:54:02.394 --> 00:54:02.775 align:middle line:90%
there, to--

00:54:02.775 --> 00:54:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: You can feel
the stress in your body.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.124 align:middle line:90%
That's the chemistry.

00:54:05.124 --> 00:54:05.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So I offer to those people, get
out of that state of stress.

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Easier said than done?

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:12.320 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
different things

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked about on
"Gaiam Inspirations" that

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:14.830 align:middle line:90%
offer outs--

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:15.704 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:54:15.704 --> 00:54:17.610 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: --of ways of
thinking and studying

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:20.760 align:middle line:10%
deeply about the human potential
movement in health and belief

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.720 align:middle line:10%
systems and so forth.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.725 align:middle line:90%
That is-- that's proven science.

00:54:23.725 --> 00:54:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: But, you
see, it's actually,

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's been
on the outside,

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:27.690 align:middle line:90%
we call it new age stuff.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:28.814 align:middle line:90%
But what was new age stuff?

00:54:28.814 --> 00:54:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It's all it was saying
is, learn to live

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:34.300 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with the
world that you live in.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a nutritional
thing or whether it's

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.790 align:middle line:84%
a psychological thing,
the significance

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:42.350 align:middle line:84%
is that it's that's what
causes the chemistry of health

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:45.100 align:middle line:84%
or, in a negative sense,
the chemistry of disease.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:49.502 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what you said
has wrapped up everything

00:54:49.502 --> 00:54:51.460 align:middle line:84%
we've ever talked about
on "Gaiam Inspirations"

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and put it into the cellular
biological conversation.

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:58.335 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Dr. Bruce
Lipton, phenomenal contribution

00:54:58.335 --> 00:55:00.195 align:middle line:84%

00:55:00.195 --> 00:55:00.997 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Lisa, thank you.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.996 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to
thank everyone out there,

00:55:03.996 --> 00:55:06.550 align:middle line:84%
because we're in an evolution
to make a better world.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, we are.

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.300 align:middle line:84%
This is all about
our own evolution.

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, again.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.246 align:middle line:84%
