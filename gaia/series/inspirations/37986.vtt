00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:10%
So what if you found out that
90 is the new middle age?

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:10%
And what if we are not the
effect of our genetics at all

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:10%
and we discovered how
to completely rewrite

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:10%
our genetic code?

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, some people currently
live their lives this way.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is one of
them, Dr. Mario Martinez.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Martinez is a clinical
neuropsychologist.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:10%
And he is the founder
of biocognitive science.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:10%
And he lectures worldwide
on how cultural beliefs

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:10%
affect health and longevity
more than genetics.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.434 align:middle line:84%
DR MARIO MARTINEZ:
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
LISA: So what is
biocognitive science?

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Biocognitive
science brings together

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:10%
psychoneuroimmunology-- is an
area that studies how thoughts

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:10%
and emotions affect the immune
system and other systems--

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:10%
and anthropology,
how cultures shape

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:10%
are our beliefs about health,
wellness, and so forth.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:10%
But those two disciplines aren't
really speaking to each other.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:10%
So what I did is I brought mind,
body, and culture together.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:84%
LISA: So give me an
example of how culture

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:90%
affects somebody's genetics.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: All right,
for example, menopause.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:10%
Menopause has been turned
to an illness, and it's not.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:10%
It's a process.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:10%
In Peru and other
countries, the hot flashes

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.029 align:middle line:10%
are called bochorno,
which means shame.

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:10%
And we know now from research
in psychoneuroimmunology,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:10%
the shame actually
causes inflammation.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:10%
So when you're shamed, you'll
have an inflammatory response.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:10%
So women in Peru, because
they call it shame

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:10%
and the culture sees it a
shame, have a very high level

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:10%
of inflammation during
their menopause,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.850 align:middle line:10%
especially with the hot flashes.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:10%
Go to another culture,
you go to Japan.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:10%
And in Japan, the menopause
and the hot flashes

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:10%
are called the second spring,
an opportunity for a woman

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:10%
to gain more power in
the sense of respect,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:10%
to be a resource for wisdom.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:10%
They don't have
the inflammation.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Interesting.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: So your culture
will shape the biology

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:90%
to a certain degree.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.740 align:middle line:10%
LISA: In the
experience that you've

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:10%
had with training people
all around the world

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:10%
and blending that gap between
neurocognitive science

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:10%
and their culture,
what do you think

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.174 align:middle line:10%
is the biggest break down
with people in their cultures?

00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Well, I
think that the problem

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:10%
is that people think that,
for example, the medicine is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:10%
the same everywhere, that
if you have an infection

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:10%
you just need an
antibiotic everywhere.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:10%
It's not like that at all.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:10%
In the United States,
the cause that's

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:10%
given to migraines is vascular,
but if you go to the UK

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:10%
is gastrointestinal.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:10%
If you go to France, it's liver.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:10%
So even medicine
has a way of going

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:10%
into the system,
one with vascular,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:10%
the other one with
the gastrointestinal.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:10%
And what happens
to the migraines

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.756 align:middle line:10%
probably has effects
on different parts,

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:12.179 align:middle line:10%
but the culture decides where
to go in to take care of it.

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:10%
LISA: I wonder which
one is more effective.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: They're all as
effective because what

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:10%
happened-- that's
a great question--

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:10%
because what makes
it so effective

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:10%
is the placebo effect, as
well as the biochemistry.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:10%
If you get, what I call the
culture editors, a doctor

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:10%
in a clinic, a mother at home--

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Cultural editors--

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.681 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: And it's telling you
that that cultural editor will

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:10%
say this is really
very good for you,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:10%
and it works, because
you have biochemistry,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:10%
but you also have the belief
system from an authority.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And that kicks in
right the healing value

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.717 align:middle line:90%
that we all have to self-heal.

00:03:44.717 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:10%
LISA: I wonder if the opposite
happens where you don't believe

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.140 align:middle line:10%
that medicine is going to help
you and you're told it is,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:10%
but if you don't personally
believe it, it's not going to,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:10%
is it?

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.826 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: You'll fight
it, that's right.

00:03:56.826 --> 00:03:58.886 align:middle line:84%
And even worse will
be the nocebo effect--

00:03:58.886 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
would be the
opposite of placebo.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I shall heel.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:90%
I shall harm is nocebo.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:10%
You're told you have
six months to live.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:10%
That's nocebo.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.808 align:middle line:10%
You're being sentenced there.

00:04:06.808 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:10%
That's not good science.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:10%
That's based on averages.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:10%
And when they look at the curve,
the normal curve, that illness,

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:10%
you may have six months
to live on the average.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at the other
side of the tail with the tail

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:10%
at the end, the people who
live 7 years, 10 years,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:10%
they don't look at that.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:10%
They consider that
a nuisance variable.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:10%
They only look at the middle.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:10%
So you're being sentence with
a science that is not really

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.857 align:middle line:10%
as accurate as they're saying.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:10%
LISA: That so needs
to change, though,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:10%
because the doctors are saying
these statistics to protect

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:10%
themselves legally.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:84%
LISA: And they
have an obligation

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:90%
to be able to state the facts.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:10%
But I don't think there is an
awareness on the damage that

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.651 align:middle line:10%
is done when that death
sentence is given.

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:53.483 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Of course.

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:90%
You can do it ethically.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You could say on the average
people live six months.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Now we know of many
cases that live 10 years.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:10%
What we need to do is, what
can we learn from those people

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:10%
those people using
the causes of health?

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:10%
The people that
die early are using

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:10%
the learning of an illness.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:10%
Illnesses are learned.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:10%
So that--

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Illnesses are learned?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: I think so.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.394 align:middle line:10%
I think there's
some-- of course,

00:05:16.394 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:10%
there are 2%, 3%
of illnesses that

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:10%
are genetically already
set as an expression

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:10%
of a mistake, a genetic mistake.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:10%
But that's 2%, 3%.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:10%
The rest, your immune
system is consistently

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:10%
relentlessly trying to
keep you healthy, rather

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:10%
than the other way around.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.010 align:middle line:10%
What we learn is we
learn to get sick.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:10%
Not to blame.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.981 align:middle line:10%
You don't blame yourself.

00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:10%
But you learn to get sick.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:10%
If, for example, it
was functional for you

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.657 align:middle line:10%
to be very passive and
take on a lot of abuse,

00:05:48.657 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:10%
well, that was
functional at the time.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.600 align:middle line:10%
You don't get sick, because
this is a preservation.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:10%
But let's say 10 years
you keep doing that.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:10%
You have created a
deficient immune system,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:10%
because you're responding
from helplessness.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:10%
That deficient immune
system, you can pick up

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:10%
whatever is going on, whatever
pre-cancer cells to infections.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:10%
So you're teaching a system
to be deficient if you're

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:10%
deficient by your behavior.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Interesting.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:10%
So in a sense, that's
what the cultural behavior

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:10%
is learning a
culture of sickness

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:10%
rather than learning
a culture of wellness.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes, exactly.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:10%
LISA: You shared with me that
you work with certain Fortune

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:10%
100 companies with the
executives at the companies

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:10%
on how not to burn
themselves out health-wise

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:10%
as making dozens and
dozens of decisions a day.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.892 align:middle line:10%
How do you teach
them to do that?

00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: What I teach them--
and at first they think

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.537 align:middle line:10%
I'm just coming from Mars--

00:06:46.537 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:10%
and I tell them I'm
going to teach you

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:10%
how to make decisions
in your organization

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.454 align:middle line:10%
like the immune system does.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:10%
The immune system makes hundreds
of thousands of decisions

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:10%
a second without
centralized brain function.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:10%
LISA: OK, automatically?

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Automatically.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:10%
Because what the
immune system does

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:10%
is if you have an
infection somewhere,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:10%
whatever molecule or whatever
cell from the immune system

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:10%
is taking care of it, that
becomes the local brain.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:10%
It becomes the
local intelligence.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:10%
And then when it can't
do anything more,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:10%
then it'll call in
whatever it needs.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the
distributed control.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:10%
That simple
decision-making process,

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:10%
decentralized and local
intelligence and distributed

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:10%
control changes not
only the creativity

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:10%
and the productivity, but it
changes the greatest problem

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:10%
we have in corporate America
and corporate world is

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:10%
chronic illnesses.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:84%
LISA: With the executives,
with hypertension and all that,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.263 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: Because what's
happening is what's making them

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:90%
sick is not the stressful job--

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:90%
stress can be good or bad--

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
it's the organizational
culture that they create

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:90%
that causes helplessness.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Well, it's
interesting because we're

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:10%
moving in such a
faster paced world now.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:10%
And it's just
getting get faster.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So it's
almost like we need

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:10%
to be super humans to catch
up with the pace of business

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.604 align:middle line:10%
these days.

00:08:02.604 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: Well,
in a way, what you

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.269 align:middle line:84%
want to do is you want to
be able to be mindful, to be

00:08:06.269 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:90%
selective of the information.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:10%
An example, attention deficit
disorder, it's not a disorder.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:10%
It's been turned into
an illness and it's not.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:10%
And I know the
neurochemistry and whatnot.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.074 align:middle line:10%
What it is is that these kids
have abundance of curiosity--

00:08:21.074 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:10%
LISA: And creativity--

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.031 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: And creativity.

00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have to set
up the environment

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:90%
to increase the novelty.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:10%
But the classrooms
aren't set up for them.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:10%
So it's better to medicate
and create a little zombie

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:10%
than treat it appropriately.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:10%
LISA: They're set up
for be quiet an listen.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:10%
And these kids get
bored because they

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:10%
have an abundance of novelty.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:10%
LISA: And they
don't have any say.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.916 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: They
don't have any say.

00:08:42.916 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Yeah, they're
told not to talk.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:10%
OK, there's a couple of
slides that we have here.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:10%
And this particular
slide, you say

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:10%
that most illnesses are learned
and the causes of health

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:10%
are inherited.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean by that?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:10%
We've kind of been
talking about this.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: We're born with
tremendous resilience.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:10%
We're born with a
system that knows

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:10%
how to pick up on foreign bodies
without even you knowing it,

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:10%
because they're
fighting constantly.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're already set up with all
the causes that create health.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:90%
We're already born with it.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It's in our DNA, and it's
expressed through our genes.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:90%
The illnesses are learned--

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:84%
many illnesses, not
all, because some

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
are genetic, specifically
genetic, but very low percent.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The rest is our behavior,
our belief systems,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:84%
our way of doing
things, the behavior

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:90%
is teaching the immune system.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
It's teaching the
nervous system.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.786 align:middle line:84%
It's teaching the
endocrine system

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
to function based on the
consciousness that we live.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you an
example, fibromyalgia,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
which is very common now.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Fibromyalgia, the most of
the problem of fibromyalgia

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a sleep
deficit in delta, delta sleep.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And delta is where the
immune system does a repair.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:03.780 align:middle line:84%
The pituitary release of some
of the human health hormones.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what does the
repair and increases the energy

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:90%
in the cells and all that.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So you learned to
be hyper vigilant.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:84%
You learned to be very cautious
when you were a little girl

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
because grandpa
would come in and do

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:84%
something that was inappropriate
when you were sleeping.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So I had an initial
function of wisdom.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:90%
LISA: I see.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.484 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: You had to
learn to be hypervigilant.

00:10:24.484 --> 00:10:26.150 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
you're hyper vigilant?

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
You teach your nervous system
to also be hypervigilant.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:10%
You teach your immune system
to be deficient because you

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:10%
are being hypervigilant.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:10%
It works because it has a
function of preservation.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:10%
You wait 10 years when
grandpa is no longer there.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You've taught your
nervous system

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:84%
to create chronic pain with
the primary pain receptors.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
You taught your immune system
to be deficient because it's not

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:90%
getting the delta sleep.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And you taught your
endocrine system

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:84%
to release
pro-inflammatory products.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So you taught the system
fibromyalgia-- not to blame--

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:90%
but that's what you taught it.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
The good news is if you learn
something, you can unlearn it.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Unlearn it.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.465 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: You can
unlearn fibromyalgia.

00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:07.340 align:middle line:84%
LISA: And so in effect it's as
if the grandfather is always

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the way that
the brain is working.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But you can reverse that
through things like awareness,

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
but also through what you talk
about in terms of the mind body

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:90%
code.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So we have here a slide
of the cover of "The Mind Body

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:10%
Code."

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:10%
This particular picture
that we're looking at here

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:10%
is the cover of
your CD set, right?

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:10%
LISA: OK, what is
the mind body code?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: I studied two
very unusual populations--

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
centenarians, people
who are over 100,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
but healthy centenarians,
not centenarians who are

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:90%
vegetating and in bad shape.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
their genetics is only

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
about the genetic
contribution to the longevity.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:90%
So maybe 20% top.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Another very interesting group
of people, very, very unusual

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
are the people with stigmata,
who have the wounds of Christ.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're only the
Catholics-- see the culture.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you find a legitimate
stigmatic, 1 out of 100--

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and there've only been about
380 since Saint Francis

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:90%
and the 13th century--

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:84%
you find that these people
have a hyperimmunity.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And people around them,
if they're Catholic,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:90%
will have spontaneous healing.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's a mind body code.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:84%
That is by believing
something, you

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:84%
trigger something that is
transbiological in a sense.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
One for National Geographic had
a woman who had the stigmata,

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and a man was cured, total
spontaneous remission,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.326 align:middle line:84%
of prostate cancer, and
a little boy of leukemia.

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And I followed up with their
physician nine months later,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:90%
no symptoms.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.520 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Oh, my
goodness, we're going

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at that National
Geographic piece in a minute.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:90%
So they have hyperimmunity.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:84%
What about these particular
people, the centenarians?

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: The centenarians they
defy what gerontology tells us,

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:10%
that you go from
order to disorder,

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.465 align:middle line:10%
because we borrowed
them from physics.

00:13:06.465 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:10%
That's good for carburetors
and planets and other things,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:10%
but not for human beings.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't go from
order to disorder.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:90%
We go from simple to complex.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So what we think that's
becoming a deteriorating brain

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:90%
is becoming a complex brain.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:10%
So these centenarians,
they don't

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.360 align:middle line:10%
buy into what I call
the cultural portals--

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:10%
infancy, young adult, middle
age, third age or elderly.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:10%
And without us knowing it, it's
so subtle, if you're 44 today,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:10%
you're pre-middle age.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.196 align:middle line:84%
But if the next day you're
45, you're middle age.

00:13:44.196 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And you fall into a portal.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:90%
You begin to dress middle age.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:90%
The car has to be middle age.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to be thinking
about retirement.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what ages you
to the greatest degree.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
LISA: So as I said earlier,
90 being the new middle age,

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I got that from you
CD series, yeah.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: And when you
ask a centenarian--

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask them anywhere
in the world--

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:90%
what's middle age?

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:90%
I'll find out when I die.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.631 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Look backwards.

00:14:07.631 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: And the worst
thing you could do

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.145 align:middle line:10%
is go to an actuarial
and see this is my age

00:14:12.145 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:10%
and this is how long
I'm going to live.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:10%
That's sentencing yourself.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:10%
That's not good science.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.466 align:middle line:84%
Those are probabilities,
but not sentencing.

00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Those are statistics.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So this particular
gentleman that you

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:90%
have running here a marathon.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:10%
At what age is he?

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: He ran
this marathon at 101.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:10%
And he started running
I believe in his 80s

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:10%
because his son died.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And in order to deal with
that, he started running.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you train your body,
your body will continue to run.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
And then 101.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:90%
LISA: 101.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.022 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: He completed
the marathon.

00:14:43.022 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:10%
LISA: And he started
running at 85.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:10%
So the ideas of the
joints not holding up

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:10%
for the long period of time,
he didn't have that thought.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: No.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And actually, your joints--

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.537 align:middle line:90%
there's some damage.

00:14:54.537 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I think swimming is
better in general.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:10%
But it will do some damage.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:10%
But what happens is that
what you're believing

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.992 align:middle line:10%
and what you're doing,
you're being cautious

00:15:02.992 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:10%
because another thing
about centenarians,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.616 align:middle line:10%
they're very cautious.

00:15:05.616 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't find any
addictive centenarians.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:90%
They're middle way.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
They'll smoke a cigar
before they go to sleep,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:90%
but only a cigar.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask them, why
don't you smoke any more?

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:90%
I only enjoy one.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's a ritual,
rather than a routine.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:10%
So this runner at 101 completed
the marathon actually.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Oh, my goodness, 20
something miles, 27 miles,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:90%
my goodness.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is funny.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean now how many
of the centenarians

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:90%
have a sense of humor?

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.408 align:middle line:84%
This next picture is
actually terrifying.

00:15:33.408 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: I would say
a very high percent.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
This woman on her
100th birthday,

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
she just lit up a
cigarette with the candles.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.777 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Oh, does she smoke?

00:15:41.777 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: She smoked, yes.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:90%
LISA: She and George Burns.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
LISA: But you said they
don't take a lot of risks.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:90%
This particular one that was a--

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
every body is
different, who knows?

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: Well,
they don't abuse.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:10%
What they do is they do it in--

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.376 align:middle line:10%
a ritual is something that
you do to identify who you are

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:01.125 align:middle line:10%
and your culture and
to really enjoy like,

00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:10%
for example, a birthday,
going to an exalted place

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:10%
or religious place once a year.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:10%
Those things identify who
you are and your culture.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.644 align:middle line:10%
A Cuban centenarian,
this woman was about 103.

00:16:14.644 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I asked her-- at first I would
think-- what's your secret?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I
have a little shot of rum

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
before I go to
sleep every night.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it's got to
be some quality of the run,

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and not the rum
and not the cigar.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
What I found is that
quality is in the ritual,

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:90%
whatever you, do the ritual.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So she would have a shot of rum,
but she wasn't an alcoholic.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
She would drink the rum as a
ritual before going to sleep.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.215 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
process, you're very

00:16:39.215 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:90%
aware of what you're doing.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:10%
It's not habitual like
taking a shower, or driving

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:10%
and you get some where and
you say, I can't believe

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:10%
I just got here.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:90%
That's habit.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you do it
ritualistically,

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
it actually has a very
powerful effect on your health.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Wasn't that an old remedy?

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.686 align:middle line:84%
An old cold remedy
is a shot of rum.

00:16:56.686 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:90%
She's still using it.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.518 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: That's right.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say for
medicinal purposes only.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, but--

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Right, right.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, this next picture
is this wonderful couple.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:10%
They look great.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:10%
Who are these guys?

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: They're what I
call the commitments to

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:10%
for centering consciousness.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:10%
The present is never too
late to make commitments.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:10%
The one on the left,
they're married.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:10%
They got married.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:10%
And on the one on the
right, I think in his 90s,

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:10%
he went back to college
and got his degree

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:10%
when he was very
close to being 100.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So the present is never too
late to make commitments.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Wow.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:10%
And they got married at 100.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:10%
So there's centenarians that
are a hundred years old.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
super centenarians

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:90%
that are a hundred--

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: 110.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:90%
LISA: 110.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:10%
Have you interviewed them?

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.520 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: One, yes.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Where did he live?

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: This is in Ecuador.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:10%
I have the field
notes and I said,

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.326 align:middle line:10%
so do you know you're
a super centenarian?

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at me and
says, what the hell is that?

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you
know, you're over 110.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was very funny.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that these people

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:84%
when they hit 100, the
deteriorating rate goes down.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Really?

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:90%
They deteriorate less.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Less.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.200 align:middle line:90%
The deteriorate slower.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And, for example, a
90-year-old, healthy 90-year-old

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
has a greater probability
of staying healthier

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:90%
than a 60-year-old.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:10%
They have more
experience with health.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.630 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Is that in that
particular culture?

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: No, no.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.805 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Because out here,
we'll say, oh, at 90,

00:18:31.805 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:10%
they lived a long, good life.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: But you see, the
centenarians in this country,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.120 align:middle line:10%
there are 100,000
centenarians now.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:10%
LISA: 100,000?

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.310 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: They're the
fastest growing segment

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:10%
of population in the US.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:90%
LISA: The US?

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: And when you
ask the centenarians,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:90%
they have a culture--

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Really?

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.938 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: Yes, they
have a culture.

00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:90%
They don't buy into that--

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately, medicine,
you go to a doctor, and not all,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:84%
but some will say,
well, what do you want?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:90%
You're 90.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.039 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
doctor who is 80.

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell this
story, because it's great.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:84%
It tells you how
we shape people.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
His right knee was
hurting, and he was 80.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.757 align:middle line:90%
And he goes to a colleague.

00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my right
knee is hurting.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:90%
What do you want?

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Your 80.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.215 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll
tell you what I want.

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:10%
My left me is 80.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's not hurting.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I want it to be
like my left knee.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But the attribution is
that, well, you're 90.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.974 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying,
just give up and die,

00:19:18.974 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:90%
you've been around too long.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Well, what would you
say that these centenarians

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.164 align:middle line:10%
have in common?

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.330 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: These things that
we're pointing out here,

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:10%
they have tremendous
sense of humor.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
The present is always an
opportunity to make decisions.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:10%
They know how to forgive--

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:10%
extremely important.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:10%
I interviewed one
here in the US who had

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:10%
been in a concentration camp.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:10%
They're not Pollyanna.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:10%
They not touchy feely.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:10%
They're people that
go through the pain,

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:10%
but then they get
out of their pain.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
So I asked him, how was it?

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, it was the worst
experience of my life.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
remember the most?

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a kid my age,
who was a Nazi, army,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:84%
he would sneak
bread into my cell.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.334 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I remember.

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:10%
I also remember
that my mother was

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.316 align:middle line:10%
going to be very upset because
I couldn't write to her.

00:20:05.316 --> 00:20:06.409 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: And I said, so
what was the first thing

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:10%
you did when you got out?

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:10%
I talked to my mother and
I told her what happened,

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:10%
and she got very
upset with the guards.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It's that resilience, that
way of looking at things.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And I asked him, do
you hate those people?

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.959 align:middle line:10%
I dislike him, but
I'm not going to waste

00:20:23.959 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:10%
any time with people like that.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:10%
I had too many things to do.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:27.860 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Wow.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.150 align:middle line:10%
Total appreciation for life.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.358 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Total appreciation.

00:20:30.358 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:10%
And what he
remembered was an act

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:10%
of kindness in a
puddle of infamy.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:10%
LISA: One act of kindness pulled
him through all of those years.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.503 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: That's it.

00:20:41.503 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:10%
And that's all we need.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:10%
When I work with
patients and they tell me

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:10%
they had a hard
life, I say, look,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:10%
it couldn't be worse than
a Nazi concentration camp.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:10%
Tune into what has
happened to you,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:10%
humane, something
that has touched you,

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:10%
somebody that gave
you compassion.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:10%
And then build from there.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Do you live
your life differently

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:10%
after interviewing all
these centenarians?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:10%
I don't tell my age anymore,
because they'll peg you.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:10%
You ask him, how old are you?

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:10%
When I turned 100,
I start lying.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So if they're 100,
they'll say I'm 120.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But before that, you
don't tell you age.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:90%
LISA: How funny.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: And the reason,
I think, bioculturally

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:10%
is that when you tell
your age, you're pegged.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
If you say, I'm 80, oh,
OK, you look so good.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.964 align:middle line:84%
And they put you
into that mindset.

00:21:31.964 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And they don't look what
you have done in your life.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.930 align:middle line:84%
They look at how long
you've been in life.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:90%
And they start treating you--

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Definitely--

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:39.936 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Differently.

00:21:39.936 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:10%
And that's what ages people.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:84%
LISA: OK, so don't
tell your age,

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.830 align:middle line:90%
is the one tip you've learned.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.880 align:middle line:90%
What's another one?

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Sense of humor.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:10%
Find humor in things.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.920 align:middle line:10%
Don't be pollyannish
in the sense

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:10%
that if something bad happens,
you say, oh, I'm so happy.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:10%
Embody what's going
on and then let it go.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:10%
And then move into what
is the wisdom here?

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:10%
The universe has
a lot of comedy.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:10%
Go into the comedy to
find out what happens.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Because what it does is
when you're laughing,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
you have cardiovascular
dilation.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.157 align:middle line:84%
You're increasing
immune function.

00:22:15.157 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:10%
All kinds of things
that are going on.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:10%
But you can't do it
before you feel the hit.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:10%
You got to feel the hit.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:90%
You've got to embody it.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.769 align:middle line:84%
And then allow yourself
to experience it.

00:22:25.769 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:90%
LISA: That's interesting.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:90%
I have a 10-year-old.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:90%
And we were at her soccer game.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And some of the other parents
get so upset with their kids.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:90%
They're 10.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.220 align:middle line:10%
And so something
happened on the field,

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.584 align:middle line:10%
and I was in the background
next to the parents.

00:22:42.584 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:10%
And I said, wow, that's
just pure comedy, because it

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:10%
was a giant kerfuffle.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the dads got so
mad, because he was just

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:90%
taking it way too seriously.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:90%
He homeschools his kid.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:90%
This is her life.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:90%
And she's 10.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes the
sense of humor gets lost

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.682 align:middle line:84%
and it's being taught
to our kids these days.

00:23:02.682 --> 00:23:05.140 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: And if you're too
mechanical about teaching, then

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.132 align:middle line:10%
what you're teaching
is to be mechanical.

00:23:07.132 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:10%
Not the information
that you're teaching.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So how can the mind
wound the body?

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:84%
How can it actually
work against us?

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: If, for
example, we know

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:10%
that there's
spontaneous healings,

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:10%
a person believes
something and they actually

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.520 align:middle line:10%
are allowed to heal themselves.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:10%
I'll give you an example.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:10%
There was reported in one
of psychiatric journals,

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:10%
in a Catholic
hospital, the priest

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.586 align:middle line:10%
came into the room
for this patient

00:23:35.586 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:10%
to give him the last rites.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.834 align:middle line:10%
He gave him the last rites.

00:23:37.834 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:10%
And he died in 15 minutes.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.800 align:middle line:10%
The problem is that he
went to the wrong room.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:10%
So what happened is that
in this person's mind,

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.270 align:middle line:10%
two authorities in a context,
a doctor and a priest,

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:10%
are telling me that I'm not
going to be around anymore.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.290 align:middle line:90%
They have that nocebo effect.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you do an
autopsy, there's

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:84%
nothing wrong except some kind
of parasympathetic stopping

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But now the person who
was scheduled to die

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:84%
waited two days for the
priest to come before he died.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So the mind can wound and
can heal based on the belief

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:90%
systems that we have.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.070 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Wow.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.640 align:middle line:10%
So you can really change--

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.300 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the power of
changing your belief system.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And you said to me, look
for the signals of health.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.440 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Not for the
signals of sickness.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Exactly.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And an example of what we
were talking about earlier,

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
if you're not feeling
well, for example--

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and of course, you
have to check it out.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:90%
You have to go to your doctor.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.846 align:middle line:90%
But you're not feeling well.

00:24:34.846 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:84%
You know there's an infection
or something or a cold.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:10%
Your body is going
to go into what's

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:10%
called a sick response,
which is it'll slow down.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:10%
And you'll feel a little
bit groggy and tired.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Your system is saying, slow
down so I can take care of you.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.590 align:middle line:10%
So one way to begin to
help that is to tune

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:10%
into any little signal
you have of recovery.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:10%
Like you're breathing a little
bit, you breathe into it.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:10%
You feel that less pain,
you tune into that.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.040 align:middle line:10%
So what you're doing is you're
kicking in signals of health

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.706 align:middle line:10%
rather signals of the
sickness response.

00:25:10.706 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:10%
You compress the
time that you're

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:10%
going to be spending
sick, but you're actually

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.699 align:middle line:10%
helping your immune system.

00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Oh, I've done that.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Sat in bed miserable.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Felt sorry for myself.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Thought I was going to die.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's right, the
brain goes immediately

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.791 align:middle line:90%
towards the signals of sickness.

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: It defeats it.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:10%
And I was telling you before
the show that I flew about 22,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.430 align:middle line:10%
24 hours from Uruguay to
Miami, Miami to San Francisco.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:10%
Well, I was beginning to have
the kind of a sense of you're

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:10%
going to catch something.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, what
happens is you're not

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:84%
sleeping well on the
plane and not eating well.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.160 align:middle line:10%
And you're really getting
some immune deficiency.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:10%
So you're picking up
all that's going on.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:10%
I stopped.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:10%
I did some of the techniques
that we talked about.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:10%
Did a little meditation.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:10%
Took some vitamins.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:10%
And began to be very
careful not to eat

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.260 align:middle line:10%
any refined carbohydrates
for the next two days

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:10%
because that's pro-inflammatory.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:10%
Gone.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm fine.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So if you don't mind, I'd
love to share this technique.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Sure.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So this is a
shamanic technique

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:10%
that Dr. Martinez taught
me before the show.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:10%
And tell me where was
the origin of this?

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: I had a
Tibetan Lama teacher

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:10%
who taught me the technique.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:10%
In their world is moving the
chi, moving the energy around.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:10%
In our world, you're
actually creating immunity

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:10%
and you're creating
some kinds of changes

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.199 align:middle line:10%
in your endocrine system.

00:26:36.199 --> 00:26:37.240 align:middle line:10%
Do you want me to did it?

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Yeah.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:10%
Now how long has this
technique been used?

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Oh, for thousands
of years, since Buddha.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.750 align:middle line:10%
So about 2,500 years.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.442 align:middle line:10%
So we have a lot to
learn from their ways.

00:26:49.442 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:10%
And they have a lot
to learn from us too.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:10%
We've taught them what we
can do with functional MRIs

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.100 align:middle line:10%
and how the brain
shifts and all that.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:10%
But basically what
they're doing is

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:10%
they're moving, creating
what they call chi.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:84%
LISA: So if you have a cold or
if you're feeling low energy,

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.860 align:middle line:90%
this is a great thing.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.655 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this together.

00:27:05.655 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Hold it like this.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:10%
LISA: And we might have a little
bit of an audio problem here,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:10%
but we'll figure it out.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.081 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: So you move
your hands like this.

00:27:11.081 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're creating a
sense of cohesiveness.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And you could call it chi.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.591 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:27:15.591 --> 00:27:16.840 align:middle line:90%
You do this for a few minutes.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:10%
And then what you do is
you put your arms gently

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.860 align:middle line:10%
over your shoulder crossed and
then go forward nine times.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:10%
And you're going
to begin to feel

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:10%
some movement, some warmth.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And then after 9, 10 times,
then you go backwards.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
finish, you stop.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:90%
And then feel what's happened.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Feel what's happened.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.620 align:middle line:90%
You feel some energy change.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, what have you done
psychoneuroimmunology?

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.785 align:middle line:10%
First, you created
a placebo effect.

00:27:45.785 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:10%
This is something
that's going to work.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:53.500 align:middle line:10%
Second, the touching
releases oxytocin,

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:10%
which actually oxytocin
can do all kinds of things.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:10%
There are receptors in the
heart that can regulate heart.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:10%
You release IGAs, which
are an antibody that

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.830 align:middle line:10%
fights upper respiratory
signals and viruses.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:10%
And all kinds of other
things that are going on.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:10%
You're beginning to feel the
effect of when your grandmother

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:10%
touch you and loved you.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:10%
And so all of that
has a healing effect,

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:10%
psychoneuroimmunology
has a healing effect.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.810 align:middle line:10%
The Tibetans know how to
do it, but they don't know

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.060 align:middle line:10%
the biochemistry behind it.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:10%
And you do it.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.661 align:middle line:10%
And it works.

00:28:25.661 --> 00:28:26.493 align:middle line:10%
LISA: And you feel--

00:28:26.493 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's amazing how
much energy that you get.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.619 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if someone
had come up behind you

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:32.192 align:middle line:90%
and give you a nice neck rub.

00:28:32.192 --> 00:28:33.900 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't it always feel
like you just melt

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:10%
when somebody does that to you?

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.310 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the feeling
that that gives you.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.590 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple though.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: And if you're tense
and if you're hypervigilant,

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a lot of
norepinephrine and epinephrine

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:90%
and cortisol.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:84%
As you relax, cortisol
takes about 30 minutes

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.070 align:middle line:84%
to get from the trauma to
upper levels in the blood.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.846 align:middle line:84%
You have 30 minutes
to reverse that.

00:28:54.846 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you're truck
driving around

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.636 align:middle line:84%
and you have this
reaction, you're

00:28:57.636 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:84%
going to have a sympathetic
system released quickly.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But the cortisol
will take longer.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.166 align:middle line:10%
So what you do is you relax.

00:29:05.166 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:10%
How can I celebrate that
I didn't have an accident?

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:10%
Let me get some
comfortable music.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:10%
Let me breathe.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.640 align:middle line:10%
The person next to
you, blood pressure

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.235 align:middle line:10%
up, under immunity
because of the reaction,

00:29:14.235 --> 00:29:16.110 align:middle line:10%
you're driving around
and you learn something

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.090 align:middle line:10%
from what happened.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.654 align:middle line:10%
And so you become a master
of your own health--

00:29:20.654 --> 00:29:23.070 align:middle line:10%
with the help of other people,
professionals and so forth.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But you are responsible
for your health.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Wow.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:90%
That's such a key.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.610 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: It's empowering.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.340 align:middle line:84%
LISA: What you just said now is
such a key, especially when it

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
comes to our health
care system and what's

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:84%
happening with the changes
in our health care system.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:10%
Preventative health and
taking responsibility

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.460 align:middle line:10%
for your own health is
pretty much in the way

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.626 align:middle line:10%
of the future at this point.

00:29:39.626 --> 00:29:40.470 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:10%
LISA: And as is forgiveness,
you mentioned that earlier.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.182 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness is key, right?

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Forgiveness is key.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And forgiveness, a
way to look at it,

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:50.370 align:middle line:84%
is an act of self-love
to liberate yourself.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.809 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to reconcile
with the perpetrator.

00:29:53.809 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
LISA: So it can be
just for yourself.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.308 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: For yourself.

00:29:56.308 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
sanctify the perpetrator.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:84%
The perpetrator continues
to be a perpetrator,

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.522 align:middle line:84%
continues to be a rapist,
continues to be a whatever.

00:30:03.522 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:10%
But what you're doing is
you're taking the power away

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:10%
that that person took
from you, from the wound

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:10%
that that person created.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.200 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Let's think about
that for a second.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, they take your power
way when you're violated.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.570 align:middle line:10%
So how do you get
that power back?

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.420 align:middle line:10%
It's not from them.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: No.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:10%
LISA: It's I'm yourself.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.600 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: It's from yourself.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.070 align:middle line:10%
And there's a
method that I teach.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an
intellectual process.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to find out
what wound it cause,

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:84%
because across cultures I
found that the three wounds.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:10%
I call them archetypal
wounds, because you see them

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.190 align:middle line:10%
in every culture.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.240 align:middle line:10%
shame, abandonment,
and betrayal.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:10%
So you have to find out what
if somebody was predatory

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.520 align:middle line:10%
with you.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:10%
What did they do?

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Did they abandoned you?

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Did they betray?

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Or did they shame you?

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.180 align:middle line:10%
And each of them has a
different biochemical process.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Shame has a lot of inflammatory.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:90%
LISA: What does betrayal have?

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: Betrayal has
a lot of also anger.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
When you feel betrayed,
you have a lot of anger.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.178 align:middle line:84%
So you have a lot
of norepinephrine

00:30:56.178 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the
sympathetic system.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.950 align:middle line:10%
And it has a
propensity, not a cause,

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.310 align:middle line:10%
but a propensity for
cardiovascular problems.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.680 align:middle line:84%
People that are very
angry, you see that.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:90%
And you see people with strokes.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't cause.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.340 align:middle line:90%
It's just correlation.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:10%
LISA: OK, what
about abandonment?

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.550 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Abandonment
is you feel cold

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:10%
when abandonment actually.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
At 4, you could feel
abandoned because mommy

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:90%
didn't come to pick you up.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:84%
The kids are there
and mommy is there.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:10%
So you feel a sense of
isolation, coldness.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:10%
And you also have that
sense of hypervigilance.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:10%
Where's my mother?

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:10%
So you're teaching nervous
system to be hypervigilant.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And with the one that's been
study the most is shame.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:84%
With shame, you
have inflammation.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Many of autoimmune
illnesses have

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:84%
some kind of shame trauma in
addition to predisposition.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.000 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Very interesting.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:84%
All right, so you talk about the
idea of navigating uncertainty

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.170 align:middle line:90%
with chaos as your guide.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.697 align:middle line:10%
Navigating uncertainty
with chaos as your guide,

00:31:59.697 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:10%
what does that mean?

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:01.840 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: That sounds
crazy, doesn't it?

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.420 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Yeah.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.190 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: But what
happens is uncertainty

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:10%
is there all the time.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.409 align:middle line:10%
We create order in the world.

00:32:07.409 --> 00:32:08.450 align:middle line:10%
The world is not ordered.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.250 align:middle line:10%
We create order.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.250 align:middle line:10%
We go from A to B. And
we think that this order,

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.166 align:middle line:10%
because it's the left
side of the brain that's

00:32:13.166 --> 00:32:13.970 align:middle line:10%
causing sequence.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:84%
But the world is
basically chaotic.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And chaotic is not random.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Chaotic is from
complexity theory.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:25.102 align:middle line:10%
It's really disordered order.

00:32:25.102 --> 00:32:26.435 align:middle line:90%
But it has a different geometry.

00:32:26.435 --> 00:32:27.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not Euclidean.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:90%
LISA: It's random.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.730 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Random would be
that it has no predictability.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.020 align:middle line:10%
Chaos has predictability.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.640 align:middle line:10%
But like, for example,
when you're boiling water,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:10%
you see bubbles coming
and they're predictable.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:10%
But when chaos comes in,
there's a bifurcation

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.230 align:middle line:10%
that that becomes chaotic,
not random, but chaotic.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.280 align:middle line:84%
When the temperature goes
down, it goes back to linear.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:90%
You're driving around.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And in LA this will
be a very frequent.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.090 align:middle line:90%
You're stuck in traffic--

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.456 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Like that out there.

00:33:06.456 --> 00:33:07.580 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Stuck in traffic.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.060 align:middle line:10%
So you were predicting that
you were going to get there

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.710 align:middle line:10%
on time without the traffic.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:10%
So it's a predictive mode.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.710 align:middle line:10%
That's linear.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.324 align:middle line:10%
The moment that the
complexity comes in,

00:33:18.324 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:10%
the moment that bifurcation
comes in and says,

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:10%
no, no, you're going to be
stuck here, this is different.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.080 align:middle line:10%
Then you go from
confirmation to discovery.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:10%
And you stop and you
look for novelty.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:10%
How am I breathing now?

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.739 align:middle line:90%
Could I go a different way?

00:33:33.739 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:84%
What kind of music would
I like to listen to now?

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.370 align:middle line:90%
So what you do is you divert.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But you go into discovery,
not confirmation.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Confirmation is how can
I get out of here, how

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.330 align:middle line:84%
can I get out of
here, instead of what

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.380 align:middle line:90%
can I find in this moment?

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And your brain, when
you go into discovery,

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.200 align:middle line:10%
you go into what's
called mindfulness.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.780 align:middle line:10%
You release the tension and
you might discover something.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:10%
When my kids were very
young, I would take them out.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.074 align:middle line:10%
And I would tell
you, we're going

00:33:57.074 --> 00:33:58.662 align:middle line:10%
to find uncertainty today.

00:33:58.662 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:10%
And we'd go out and get lost.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Where do we go?

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.670 align:middle line:10%
Right, left, right, left.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:10%
And when we were
lost, OK, now let's

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.480 align:middle line:10%
let chaos tell us
what we need to do.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:10%
And we'd start discovering
new restaurants, playgrounds.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:09.530 align:middle line:10%
LISA: How nice.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.946 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: But
indirectly what they

00:34:10.946 --> 00:34:13.340 align:middle line:10%
were learning is that
uncertainty is something

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:10%
that gives you an opportunity
to learn, rather than to be

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:10%
afraid.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.448 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Interesting.

00:34:16.448 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:10%
That's a fun thing to do.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.230 align:middle line:10%
Now you live permanently in--

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:20.030 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Uruguay.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Right now.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.317 align:middle line:10%
And I travel quite a
bit with the work I do.

00:34:24.317 --> 00:34:25.400 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Where were you born?

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: I was born
in Cuba actually.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.854 align:middle line:10%
And my father was from Spain.

00:34:27.854 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:10%
My mother's from Cuba.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.484 align:middle line:10%
And I lived in the US most of
my life, in New York and Miami.

00:34:31.484 --> 00:34:33.650 align:middle line:10%
LISA: At what point did you
start studying medicine?

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:35.022 align:middle line:10%
And why did you?

00:34:35.022 --> 00:34:36.980 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: I went from
medicine into psychology.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.765 align:middle line:10%
I moved into
neuropsychology, which

00:34:38.765 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:10%
was something like
neurology and psychology,

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:10%
because I was very interested
in really finding out

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.250 align:middle line:10%
how the brain works.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.750 align:middle line:10%
And unfortunately,
when you study--

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.300 align:middle line:10%
neuropsychologist
is changing stuff--

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.716 align:middle line:10%
but when you study
neuropsychology

00:34:50.716 --> 00:34:52.760 align:middle line:10%
it studies the sick brain.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.080 align:middle line:10%
Somebody has a stroke.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.860 align:middle line:10%
And you have some damage
and broke an area,

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.390 align:middle line:10%
then you're going to
have a type of aphasia.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:10%
But now Richard Davis
and other neuroscientists

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.420 align:middle line:10%
are studying the healthy brain.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.670 align:middle line:10%
And what we know is that
the brain is not bipolar,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:10%
on and off.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:10%
The brain has a range.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.414 align:middle line:10%
If you lose some
ability for speech,

00:35:13.414 --> 00:35:14.830 align:middle line:10%
you can pick it
up somewhere else.

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:18.990 align:middle line:10%
There is tremendous plasticity,
tremendous redundancy.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.957 align:middle line:10%
And so it has an opportunity
to repair itself.

00:35:21.957 --> 00:35:23.290 align:middle line:90%
LISA: How do you do that though?

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.540 align:middle line:90%
How does it repair itself?

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you know of a
specific technique?

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.180 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me give
you an example.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:33.120 align:middle line:10%
There was a scientist that
did some very interesting work

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:10%
with teachers that were going
to teach blind students.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:10%
So in order for them to really
experience what it was like,

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.820 align:middle line:10%
they were blinded.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.830 align:middle line:90%
They were covered for six weeks.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:90%
The teachers were.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And it takes about six weeks for
the brain to recontextualize.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.000 align:middle line:10%
And the occipital part of the
brain-- this part of back,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:10%
it's a visual cortex--

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.890 align:middle line:10%
when you are seeing
something, you have an MRI,

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:59.520 align:middle line:10%
they show that part of
the brain lighting up.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.825 align:middle line:10%
And that's visual cortex.

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:10%
And that's a visual cortex.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.180 align:middle line:10%
That's what it is.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:10%
These people were
blind for six weeks.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:10%
What happened to the brain?

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:10%
It was no longer
the visual cortex.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.410 align:middle line:10%
It became tactile.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.080 align:middle line:84%
LISA: That was the center of
the brain that lit up the most?

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.390 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: So instead
of being visual,

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.440 align:middle line:84%
they became like the blind
people, and it became tactile.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.390 align:middle line:90%
So the brain can be so plastic.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, six weeks later,
after they started seeing,

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.030 align:middle line:84%
it went back to occipital,
occipital visual.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.530 align:middle line:84%
LISA: So only in a matter of
six weeks the brain can change.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Can change, Yes.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.150 align:middle line:90%
LISA: That's fascinating.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:10%
When I went through a head
trauma about 13 years ago,

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.410 align:middle line:10%
I lost my ability to speak.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:10%
And it took me a
while through EEG

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.910 align:middle line:10%
and different types of things--

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:42.868 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Biofeedback--

00:36:42.868 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Yeah, biofeedback-- to
rebuild that part of my brain.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:10%
It's true.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.960 align:middle line:10%
I mean, look, I'm
speaking for a living now.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: And you're
speaking for a living.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:50.900 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a phobia
of speaking in public.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.877 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth grade, I
had a five-minute speech.

00:36:57.877 --> 00:36:59.710 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at my
watch, I went, oh, God, I

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.570 align:middle line:10%
got three minutes.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.492 align:middle line:10%
I'll never do public speaking.

00:37:02.492 --> 00:37:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And guess what happens?

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:10%
You challenge yourself and
it becomes your passion.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:07.920 align:middle line:10%
Like you.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.820 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Like you're doing.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:10%
All right, so let's
talk a little bit

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.728 align:middle line:10%
about-- you mentioned
earlier in the show

00:37:11.728 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:10%
about the stigmata people.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.485 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to have you just
take a look really quickly

00:37:15.485 --> 00:37:16.485 align:middle line:10%
to see what stigmata is.

00:37:16.485 --> 00:37:18.068 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk
about these people

00:37:18.068 --> 00:37:19.260 align:middle line:90%
take a look at this video.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.520 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Clinical
psychologist Mario Martinez

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.560 align:middle line:84%
has come to Mexico's
capital to investigate

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
one intriguing case, that
of 53-year-old grandmother

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Elizabeth Sanchez.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.740 align:middle line:10%
At Easter and during
other holy days,

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:10%
Elizabeth reportedly bleeds
from her hands, feet side, side,

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.250 align:middle line:10%
and forehead.

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:43.979 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.979 --> 00:37:46.020 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: This is an
opportunity to really learn.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%
The way I look at it
is I'm a detective.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
figure out what's

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.810 align:middle line:90%
going on with the person.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:50.970 align:middle line:10%
And what's going on
with the evidence.

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:90%
And I put them both together.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
every time I do.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:58.250 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: The word stigmata
has evolved over the centuries.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.390 align:middle line:10%
It's Greek root,
stigma, literally

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:02.910 align:middle line:10%
means mark, as in
the mark people

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.790 align:middle line:10%
branded onto their cattle,
their slaves, and even

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.650 align:middle line:10%
their soldiers.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.860 align:middle line:84%
The term appears just
once in the New Testament.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:10%
In his letter to the Galatians,
the Apostle Paul writes,

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.729 align:middle line:10%
I bear the marks of the
Lord Jesus in my body.

00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:19.770 align:middle line:84%
MONSIGNOR CHARLES SCICLUNA:
Paul uses this title,

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:84%
i am a servant or
slave of Christ.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:27.000 align:middle line:84%
For him, they are
marks of Christ,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:84%
because they are the
result of his allegiance,

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.270 align:middle line:90%
his loyalty to his master.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.470 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: It took more than
1,000 years for these stigmas

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to become stigmata, the mystical
marks of Christ's crucifixion.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Martinez is one of only a
handful of medical experts

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.470 align:middle line:90%
who specialize in stigmata.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:56.810 align:middle line:84%
He's been called on twice
by the Catholic church

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to officially investigate the
authenticity of the phenomenon.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.870 align:middle line:84%
He's also looked into a
number of lower profile

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:06.860 align:middle line:84%
cases on his own, two of which
he believes to be legitimate.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.362 align:middle line:90%


00:39:09.362 --> 00:39:10.820 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: An
authentic stigmatic is

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:17.930 align:middle line:84%
one who has the wounds that can
not be explained biologically.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: This time Martinez
has a rare opportunity.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Elizabeth is bleeding.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And Martinez can take
a sample of his blood.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.030 align:middle line:84%
The cross on
Elizabeth's forehead

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.850 align:middle line:84%
is not the typical
mark of a stigmatic.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not a wound that Jesus
received in his final hours.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.444 align:middle line:84%
But Martinez believes
it's just as interesting.

00:39:38.444 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: There's
some things that

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.920 align:middle line:10%
seem compatible with
what I seen before.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:10%
And there's some
very new things,

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:10%
like the cross is very new.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.989 align:middle line:10%
The way that the blood
is dripping is very new.

00:39:47.989 --> 00:39:50.280 align:middle line:10%
I think that there's something
here that is legitimate.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:10%
It's worth looking into.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: Elizabeth
explains to Dr. Martinez

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.900 align:middle line:10%
that she has received the
more familiar marks of Christ

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:10%
in the past.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:90%
[PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.200 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Was that real?

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Was that woman real?

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.540 align:middle line:10%
Did she really--

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.370 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Well, it seems like--

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:07.282 align:middle line:10%
fortunately, all I have to do
is just to look at the science.

00:40:07.282 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:10%
What we have to do is
we have to rule out

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:10%
hysteria, multiple
personalities,

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.050 align:middle line:10%
self-inflicted
injurious behavior.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.912 align:middle line:10%
And then we did bloodwork
to see what was going on.

00:40:17.912 --> 00:40:19.370 align:middle line:10%
And the bloodwork
showed that there

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:23.510 align:middle line:10%
were deep wounds, which
means that you can't do that

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.600 align:middle line:10%
without somebody noticing it.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.150 align:middle line:10%
She woke up one
evening, one night

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.300 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the night,
and she had the cross,

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:10%
and screaming.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And her husband
looked at it-- and so

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.920 align:middle line:84%
there were no knives or
nothing to cut herself.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.146 align:middle line:84%
LISA: So how did the blood
show it was a deep wound?

00:40:39.146 --> 00:40:40.520 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: There's
some blood work

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:84%
that you can do to see if
it's superficial or deep

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.830 align:middle line:90%
with the scab that they took.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.200 align:middle line:84%
But then they also did
immunological work.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:10%
And I was expecting her to
have a lot of neutrophils,

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:10%
which are the ones that
fight infection, normal.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.312 align:middle line:10%
I was expecting cortisol to be
high because of stress, normal.

00:40:57.312 --> 00:40:58.770 align:middle line:10%
So all those things
were happening.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:40:59.810 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't healing.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.097 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't getting infected.

00:41:01.097 --> 00:41:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And the immune system
wasn't doing anything.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.030 align:middle line:84%
LISA: What type
of person was she?

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean I understand
she was very religious.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:06.938 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: A spiritual person.

00:41:06.938 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:10%
But another thing about it
is that kind of the fakes

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.620 align:middle line:10%
like to capitalize on them.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.220 align:middle line:10%
They manipulate them.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.054 align:middle line:10%
For two years she was
hiding that she had that.

00:41:16.054 --> 00:41:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And people would come
to her would heal.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.830 align:middle line:90%
But she kept it secret.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.146 align:middle line:90%
She did want anybody to know.

00:41:20.146 --> 00:41:21.770 align:middle line:10%
But the interesting
thing here-- here's

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.720 align:middle line:10%
the thing about it
that is so interesting.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.300 align:middle line:10%
I followed her for
years, several years.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And I helped her
get rid of the pain.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:90%
LISA: What pain?

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.510 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: You feel like
that you've been crucified.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's like there's
a nail going in.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So I helped her get
rid of 80% of the pain

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and then helped to
get rid of the stigma.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.090 align:middle line:10%
What happened was she was
no longer healing anybody.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:10%
People weren't seeing the pain
and the connection with Christ.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.160 align:middle line:10%
So what happened?

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.780 align:middle line:10%
Stigmata came back.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:90%
So she said I'd rather have it.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I have much less pain.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather have it so
I can help people heal.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.540 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Really?

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.164 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: But you
see, that's a culture

00:41:58.164 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:10%
of suffering to reach Christ.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.850 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Well, let's
talk about that,

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that abundance
versus deprivation.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You have a whole
concept on this.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.450 align:middle line:10%
What does that--

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: There's a
valuation self-esteem

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.540 align:middle line:10%
that tells us how much
we can accept graciously

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:10%
without sabotaging
it or getting sick.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.790 align:middle line:10%
You see people that they
work all their lives

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:27.380 align:middle line:10%
to have the mansion
somewhere and Brazil

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:10%
and six weeks later, cancer.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:29.690 align:middle line:10%
It's too much.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.420 align:middle line:10%
Joy can be too dangerous
if their self-esteem is not

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.490 align:middle line:10%
ready to handle that
level of abundance.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:10%
And the deprivation
mentality is that I'm not

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:10%
able to reach that level.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
have to look for--

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.024 align:middle line:90%
I'll give an example.

00:42:43.024 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Studies that were
done anthropologically

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.840 align:middle line:84%
with people who came
from Cuba or came

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.730 align:middle line:84%
from other countries, the ones
who had an abundance mentality,

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.700 align:middle line:84%
they would move into
wealthy neighborhoods

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.820 align:middle line:90%
in the most modest home.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.570 align:middle line:84%
The ones who had the
deprivation mentality

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.184 align:middle line:84%
would go to the
ghettos immediately,

00:43:01.184 --> 00:43:02.600 align:middle line:84%
because that's all
they could see.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.030 align:middle line:90%
They can only see the worse.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And you interview
them 10 years later,

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.880 align:middle line:10%
and they lived exactly the
expectations that they had.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:90%
You would ask them--

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.080 align:middle line:84%
here's the disempowered
and empowered.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.416 align:middle line:84%
Disempowered-- well, I
don't speak the language.

00:43:16.416 --> 00:43:18.290 align:middle line:10%
You know, this is, yeah,
it's a great country

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:19.580 align:middle line:10%
if you speak English.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So where are you going
to be 10 years from now?

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.240 align:middle line:90%
The way I am now.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.640 align:middle line:10%
The other person, empowered--
a great opportunity

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.882 align:middle line:10%
to learn English.

00:43:26.882 --> 00:43:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to find
out what I can do

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.480 align:middle line:90%
in the country of opportunity.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.380 align:middle line:10%
10 years later,
abundance, deprivation.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but illnesses,
and the other one healthy.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.540 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Really?

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.855 align:middle line:10%
Illnesses were in
the deprivation?

00:43:38.855 --> 00:43:40.896 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: In the deprivation
because deprivation,

00:43:40.896 --> 00:43:42.740 align:middle line:84%
a deprivation of
health, of everything.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:46.280 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So back to the
stigmata really quickly,

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.530 align:middle line:10%
you had a whole course
that you taught,

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.464 align:middle line:10%
called from fibromyalgia--

00:43:50.464 --> 00:43:51.380 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: To stigmata.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.580 align:middle line:10%
LISA: To stigmata.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:53.720 align:middle line:10%
What's the correlation.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:57.200 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: The
correlation is that they

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.850 align:middle line:10%
both have a self-created-- one
because of religious views.

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:01.750 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Oh, I see.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:04.333 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: And the other one is
because of the learning that we

00:44:04.333 --> 00:44:06.590 align:middle line:90%
talked, that you can learn to.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.530 align:middle line:10%
So one is very explicitly
showing, not an illness,

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:13.470 align:middle line:10%
but an actual tearing of tissue.

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.150 align:middle line:10%
And the other one
is more subtle,

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.120 align:middle line:10%
but they have very
similar processes.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.590 align:middle line:10%
So the mind body code.

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:22.697 align:middle line:10%
LISA: How did you discover all
of this and these connections?

00:44:22.697 --> 00:44:24.280 align:middle line:10%
This is not something
that you would--

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.090 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: No, no, I was
really dissatisfied--

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:26.540 align:middle line:10%
LISA: See in medicine--

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.470 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: With
conventional science.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.307 align:middle line:90%
What I studied was dissatisfied.

00:44:30.307 --> 00:44:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I just had these
things, what I call the drift.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.820 align:middle line:10%
I was asked by the
Catholic church

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.049 align:middle line:10%
to investigate this case.

00:44:36.049 --> 00:44:37.590 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know
how they found out.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said the
Vatican has ways.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.960 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Wow.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.550 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: So they call, we know
you do psychoneuroimmunology.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.940 align:middle line:84%
We want you to investigate
this priest in the Caribbean

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:90%
who had the stigmata.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Then you know BBC
picked up on it.

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And anytime there's
any stigmatic,

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.790 align:middle line:90%
they call me to investigate it.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.540 align:middle line:84%
LISA: You're now the foremost
stigmata investigator.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.990 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, that's great.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, you do talk about the
defiance of predatory science

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.870 align:middle line:10%
and this is the side
that we have here.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:07.660 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean by that?

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.410 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Predatory
science is the science

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:15.800 align:middle line:10%
that actually tries to increase
the marketing of whatever they

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.930 align:middle line:10%
do for the illness.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:24.260 align:middle line:10%
For example, you have the
science that says, well,

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.900 align:middle line:10%
it's no longer necessary to have
this prevention test done once

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.700 align:middle line:10%
a year.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.830 align:middle line:10%
Now you have to do
it every six months.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.080 align:middle line:10%
And all of that work, all
of that preventive work,

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:10%
we're 37th in the world
in longevity and health.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.000 align:middle line:10%
So obviously it doesn't work.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.910 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't work very well, but
people make a lot of money.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.290 align:middle line:10%
So what we do have is
we have a consciousness,

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:10%
a palliative medicine
consciousness.

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:49.760 align:middle line:10%
How can I make it easier for
you to go on with your illness?

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.610 align:middle line:10%
Rather than, how can I heal you?

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:57.390 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So in having those tests
and those checkups and breast

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.450 align:middle line:10%
scans and heart scans
and things like that,

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.610 align:middle line:10%
you think that it
actually causes people

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:03.030 align:middle line:10%
to look for the illness more?

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.830 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: More.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:08.270 align:middle line:10%
And I don't want to promote that
you shouldn't have checkups.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's you're right.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:10%
Because what is the
job of the physician?

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.020 align:middle line:10%
To find something
wrong with you.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.770 align:middle line:10%
And there are physicians
who are teachers.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.650 align:middle line:10%
So rather than going there to
find something wrong with you,

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.309 align:middle line:10%
they teach you how to prevent.

00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:25.100 align:middle line:10%
And they teach you how
to empower yourself.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.660 align:middle line:10%
LISA: And there's some that
are healers and are really

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.620 align:middle line:10%
good healers.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.810 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: And you want to
go to a scientist rather

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.070 align:middle line:10%
than a technician.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:34.520 align:middle line:10%
A scientist will say, OK, if you
can show me, if you can give me

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.872 align:middle line:10%
evidence, I'll work with you.

00:46:35.872 --> 00:46:37.830 align:middle line:10%
The technician will say,
no, that doesn't work.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:38.420 align:middle line:10%
This is how it is.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm the doctor.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:10%
I know.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:40.220 align:middle line:10%
You don't know.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.940 align:middle line:84%
You take this and
don't question me.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the technician.

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.227 align:middle line:84%
They only believe
what they can measure.

00:46:45.227 --> 00:46:47.060 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Which has been
statistically measured.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:47.420 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: That's right.

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.836 align:middle line:84%
LISA: But every
body is different.

00:46:48.836 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And that really does
get omitted a lot.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.480 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.870 align:middle line:10%
And everything is contextual.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:56.400 align:middle line:84%
You might have high blood
pressure in one context

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and not in another.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.720 align:middle line:10%
But if you're already
defined as a hypertensive,

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.250 align:middle line:10%
then you're hypertensive
for the rest of your life.

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:03.500 align:middle line:10%
You take medication that has
side effects or something

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.590 align:middle line:10%
else and so forth.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And many of the hypertension can
be treated without medication--

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.490 align:middle line:90%
diet, exercise, mindsets.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:13.510 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Well, let's talk about
the mindset of the immune system

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:15.500 align:middle line:10%
because it is so intelligent.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.580 align:middle line:10%
And it just
automatically strives

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:23.420 align:middle line:10%
towards homeostasis every
single second of the day.

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.770 align:middle line:10%
How do you tap into that
intelligence to heal your body?

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.440 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Well, the first
thing is to get out of the fear

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.430 align:middle line:10%
that as you grow
older you deteriorate.

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:34.679 align:middle line:10%
That's the first thing,
because you live in that fear.

00:47:34.679 --> 00:47:39.080 align:middle line:10%
And the next birthday, it's
almost like, oh, my God,

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.702 align:middle line:10%
I'm such and such an age.

00:47:40.702 --> 00:47:41.660 align:middle line:10%
That's the first thing.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.730 align:middle line:10%
And the second, to
realize that a lot

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.830 align:middle line:10%
of the processes
that are going on,

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.020 align:middle line:10%
the body's fighting
pre-cancer cells constantly.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.810 align:middle line:10%
You don't even know about.

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:54.370 align:middle line:10%
The body is repairing
tissue constantly.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:58.040 align:middle line:10%
The immune system is creating
antibodies for things

00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.570 align:middle line:10%
that it doesn't even know exist.

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:04.250 align:middle line:10%
It has a kind of a epigenetic
value that creates in random.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.260 align:middle line:10%
So it has protection
for everything.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.050 align:middle line:10%
And then second is that you have
to have a philosophy of life.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:10.190 align:middle line:10%
What am I doing here?

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:13.640 align:middle line:10%
Am I here to live and
die and then that's it?

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.564 align:middle line:10%
Or am I here to learn, to
love, to have pleasure,

00:48:17.564 --> 00:48:18.980 align:middle line:10%
to enjoy the
pleasure that I have?

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And that indirectly
causes health.

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Indirectly.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.670 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So you're basically
teaching your mind

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.147 align:middle line:10%
to act like the
immune system does.

00:48:27.147 --> 00:48:28.730 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Like the
immune system does.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:30.080 align:middle line:10%
Resilience.

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.730 align:middle line:10%
Tremendous ability to
function under turbulence.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.270 align:middle line:10%
And tremendous resources.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.120 align:middle line:10%
But here's a real simple
way to look at it.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.390 align:middle line:84%
The immune system
basically has two modes.

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It is either empowered
or it's helpless.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.110 align:middle line:10%
And it has two principles,
what I call empowerment

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.460 align:middle line:10%
1 and empowerment 2.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Any cell, the cell will go--
a neutrophil, a macrophage,

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.390 align:middle line:90%
whatever--

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.070 align:middle line:90%
E1 I call it, empowerment 1.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:00.790 align:middle line:10%
What can I do for myself
that nobody could do for me?

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.590 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:02.964 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Give me an
example of that.

00:49:02.964 --> 00:49:05.780 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: OK, you're working and
instead of going to your boss,

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:84%
you're going, what
can I do to take

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:08.940 align:middle line:90%
care of what's going on here?

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm sick.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.020 align:middle line:84%
What can I do to
take care of today?

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.250 align:middle line:10%
How can I take that--

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.100 align:middle line:10%
once you exhaust
that, you go to E2.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.830 align:middle line:10%
What can others do for me
that I can't do for myself?

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.690 align:middle line:10%
And that's how the
immune system functions.

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.350 align:middle line:10%
You have a cell that
tries to fight some kind

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.930 align:middle line:10%
of microorganism or whatever.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:27.890 align:middle line:10%
And it fights it.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:29.560 align:middle line:10%
But then here's the
pre-cancer cell.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.340 align:middle line:10%
And it says, no, I
can't handle this.

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.380 align:middle line:10%
Let me call in
the ones that can.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.390 align:middle line:10%
So E1 and E2.

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:37.550 align:middle line:10%
That alone, if you
do that in your life,

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:40.610 align:middle line:10%
you're using immune
function wisdom.

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.250 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So have you seen
spontaneous remissions

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:46.070 align:middle line:10%
in your life, in your
practice with people?

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:49.280 align:middle line:10%
Have you seen them really
truly heal their bodies

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.270 align:middle line:10%
with their mind?

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:51.070 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:54.360 align:middle line:10%
And it's rare, because we
still don't know the dynamics.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.160 align:middle line:10%
We're learning.

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.090 align:middle line:10%
But this case in Mexico
City, the boy who

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:02.330 align:middle line:10%
was cured of leukemia,
because just being

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.250 align:middle line:10%
around the stigmatic,
and the man who

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:06.830 align:middle line:10%
was cured of prostate
cancer, I checked

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.740 align:middle line:10%
with their physician,
nine months later,

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.645 align:middle line:10%
no symptoms, complete
remission, without any symptoms.

00:50:13.645 --> 00:50:15.020 align:middle line:10%
LISA: So do you
think that that's

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.770 align:middle line:10%
their immune system matching the
immune system of the stigmatic?

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:22.970 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: No, we have to
have permission to heal.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:26.990 align:middle line:10%
We have to get permission
from God, a doctor,

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:31.580 align:middle line:10%
or from a shaman to trigger
what we already have.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.140 align:middle line:10%
Our healing system we already
have, it has to be triggered.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.460 align:middle line:10%
So we need permission.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.890 align:middle line:10%
And if this person
who's Catholic

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:39.410 align:middle line:10%
believes that there's
divine intervention,

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.250 align:middle line:10%
they're around a holy person,
that holy person can heal them.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And even a child,
he didn't even know.

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a cultural belief system.

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:48.020 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Couldn't we give that
permission to ourselves?

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.160 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Yes, we can.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's when people but get
to levels where they actually

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.220 align:middle line:90%
are very empowered.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.496 align:middle line:90%
And that's what centenarians do.

00:50:55.496 --> 00:50:56.620 align:middle line:90%
LISA: They heal themselves?

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.078 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: Yes, they
go to a doctor.

00:50:58.078 --> 00:51:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, you have
an illness that 99% of people

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.490 align:middle line:90%
die from.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:03.656 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, I'm going
to go out and celebrate

00:51:03.656 --> 00:51:05.309 align:middle line:90%
because I must be that 1%.

00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:06.350 align:middle line:90%
That's how they function.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Resilient and they
don't give up.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.600 align:middle line:84%
LISA: How many of them
have you interviewed?

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.820 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Probably
about 400, 450.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.230 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Wow.

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And what is the main thing
that you think that they

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.900 align:middle line:90%
eat that keeps them healthy?

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.317 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's
the food at all?

00:51:22.317 --> 00:51:23.899 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: I used to
think it was food.

00:51:23.899 --> 00:51:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Some will eat meat.

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Some are vegetarians.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Some eat fish.

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Some, a lot of lactose.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:32.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's basically how they eat.

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:10%
They don't abuse food.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.705 align:middle line:10%
There are some that are
hefty, but very few obese.

00:51:37.705 --> 00:51:40.450 align:middle line:10%


00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:42.830 align:middle line:10%
So they basically
enjoy what they eat.

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:47.060 align:middle line:10%
They smoke, some, very
moderately, ritualistically.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.380 align:middle line:10%
They drink wine.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.690 align:middle line:10%
They'll have rum at
the end of the day.

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.237 align:middle line:10%
But they don't abuse.

00:51:52.237 --> 00:51:53.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not an abuse of the--

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:53.960 align:middle line:90%
LISA: It's ritualistic.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.830 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: It's ritualistic.

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So it has a medicinal
purpose in the sense

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.541 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm going to
have this as a ritual.

00:51:58.541 --> 00:52:02.450 align:middle line:84%
If you have one shot
of rum at night,

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.420 align:middle line:84%
obviously it's not going to kill
you because this woman is 103.

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's evidence there that
it's not going to kill you.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not suggesting you do that.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm suggesting you
find a ritual that

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:13.970 align:middle line:84%
has meaning in your
culture, whatever

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that is, whether it's meditation
or prayer or whatever it is.

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:18.270 align:middle line:90%
And you do it.

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:20.390 align:middle line:90%
And that has the healing effect.

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.342 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Have you ever been sick?

00:52:22.342 --> 00:52:24.050 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Yeah, I've
had colds and things

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:27.110 align:middle line:10%
like that and one accident,
three broken ribs.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:30.050 align:middle line:84%
But I've never been
really sick in that sense.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:33.380 align:middle line:84%
LISA: If you were to
catch a virus or whatnot,

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:37.220 align:middle line:84%
do you think that all that
you know you could actually

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.355 align:middle line:90%
heal that with your mind?

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:39.980 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: With your
mind and your body.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.790 align:middle line:10%
And if you can't, then you can
go to an understanding doctor,

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.980 align:middle line:10%
to a scientist,
not a technician.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.070 align:middle line:10%
The scientist will say, if you
show me evidence, I'll agree.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.459 align:middle line:84%
A technician will say, no,
only what I can measure.

00:52:51.459 --> 00:52:53.000 align:middle line:84%
That's a technician,
not a scientist.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.680 align:middle line:10%
LISA: I mean it's
interesting, because I

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:59.450 align:middle line:10%
think that we need to empower
ourselves more when it comes

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:01.940 align:middle line:10%
to health care these days
because our health care

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:05.660 align:middle line:10%
system is changing so
quickly and so frequently.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:09.260 align:middle line:10%
That there's a situation
where we're in as a country

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.840 align:middle line:10%
right now, we don't really
know the outcome of it.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.294 align:middle line:10%
So I mean, some doctors are
charging an arm and a leg

00:53:16.294 --> 00:53:17.960 align:middle line:10%
because they don't
want to go-- and they

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:10%
want to privatize now
because they don't

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.230 align:middle line:10%
want to go through Obamacare.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:10%
And there's so many
different things

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.550 align:middle line:10%
that's happening with
our health care system.

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:29.480 align:middle line:10%
Is there any way that you
know of that can actually

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:35.390 align:middle line:10%
help train doctors to be
more of the intuitive healer

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:37.490 align:middle line:10%
rather than just the technician?

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Are they running so scared
at this point that that's

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:41.750 align:middle line:90%
a thing of the past?

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:42.791 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: We're doing it.

00:53:42.791 --> 00:53:45.050 align:middle line:84%
We've trained over 400 doctors
in different countries,

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:48.236 align:middle line:84%
and in Uruguay and in Ireland
and the United States.

00:53:48.236 --> 00:53:49.735 align:middle line:10%
But there's some
medical schools now

00:53:49.735 --> 00:53:51.943 align:middle line:10%
that are doing integrative
medicine, who are actually

00:53:51.943 --> 00:53:53.029 align:middle line:10%
bringing in other methods.

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:55.070 align:middle line:84%
LISA: Do you think that's
the future of medicine?

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:57.284 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: I think so.

00:53:57.284 --> 00:53:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And not alternative medicine,
because alternative is

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:00.980 align:middle line:90%
either modern medicine or not.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to integrate the
best of the two systems.

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.930 align:middle line:84%
LISA: And that's
combination of--

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:08.736 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: Western medicine,
some Eastern, and even

00:54:08.736 --> 00:54:09.860 align:middle line:90%
some other Native American.

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.740 align:middle line:10%
There's a physician,
Luis Medrano,

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:10%
who's a well trained physician
from Stanford Medical

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:20.900 align:middle line:10%
School, who uses narratives,
like the Navajo culture

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:21.760 align:middle line:10%
that he came from.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.350 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Stories?

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.308 align:middle line:90%
MARTINEZ: Storytelling.

00:54:23.308 --> 00:54:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And storytelling can
have a healing effect.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:27.622 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Yes, you tell
a lot of stories.

00:54:27.622 --> 00:54:28.580 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: That's right.

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.600 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Absolutely.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.516 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: But we do have
to get away from what

00:54:31.516 --> 00:54:33.690 align:middle line:10%
I call conveyor belt medicine.

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:36.730 align:middle line:84%
The cubicles and, oh, yes, a
psychiatrist on the average

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:38.564 align:middle line:84%
will see a person
for eight minutes.

00:54:38.564 --> 00:54:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And they look at
vegetative signs.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're, OK, we're
going to change this.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:42.410 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:43.730 align:middle line:90%
You can't heal like that.

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:44.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.040 align:middle line:84%
LISA: But that's the way
the insurance companies are

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:46.600 align:middle line:90%
forcing the doctors to be.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.540 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: Absolutely.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.020 align:middle line:10%
And a doctor will graduate
from medical school

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:53.960 align:middle line:10%
with an average
debt of $200,000.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.590 align:middle line:10%
What are they going to do?

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.020 align:middle line:10%
They have to buy
into the system.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And they have to charge,
because you have to live.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's the system
that has to change.

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.410 align:middle line:90%
How does it change?

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:05.150 align:middle line:84%
The free market can change
it to a certain degree,

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:07.149 align:middle line:84%
because you don't like
what this person's doing,

00:55:07.149 --> 00:55:09.740 align:middle line:84%
you start taking
responsibility for your health.

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to
other integrative kind

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.420 align:middle line:90%
of systems that are going on.

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.600 align:middle line:10%
A good friend of
mine is a physician

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.630 align:middle line:10%
and he's teaching
people, in addition

00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:22.430 align:middle line:10%
to whatever medical
intervention he does,

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:24.650 align:middle line:10%
he teaches them a
lifestyle that's

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:26.350 align:middle line:10%
incompatible with the illness--

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:26.740 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Incompatible?

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.960 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: Incompatible
with the illness.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:28.350 align:middle line:90%
LISA: In what way?

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:29.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.951 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: For example,
if you're a diabetic

00:55:30.951 --> 00:55:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and you take
medication, what would

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.380 align:middle line:84%
be incompatible with
being a diabetic?

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that you
can do is-- well, good health.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.630 align:middle line:10%
But one of the
things about diabetes

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:44.486 align:middle line:10%
is that there's a certain
amount of unresolved anger.

00:55:44.486 --> 00:55:46.610 align:middle line:10%
And if you ask the person,
yeah, I don't get angry.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:47.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't get angry.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:50.210 align:middle line:84%
When you don't get angry, you
secrete a lot of endorphins.

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:52.652 align:middle line:10%
And there's some research
beginning to look at this.

00:55:52.652 --> 00:55:54.360 align:middle line:10%
And when you secrete
a lot of endorphins,

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.810 align:middle line:10%
which is good, but
too much is not good,

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:58.460 align:middle line:10%
you anesthetize the anger.

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And high levels of
endorphins begins

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to affect the
metabolism of glucose.

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:03.930 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Sugar.

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:06.270 align:middle line:84%
MARTINEZ: So there's
some correlation there.

00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:07.070 align:middle line:90%
LISA: Interesting.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:11.000 align:middle line:10%
So are you saying to diabetics
to have anger management?

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.050 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: To be able to
express what they feel--

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:13.850 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Healthily--

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:15.620 align:middle line:10%
MARTINEZ: To express it healthy.

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:16.835 align:middle line:10%
To let go of the control.

00:56:16.835 --> 00:56:19.340 align:middle line:10%


00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:22.850 align:middle line:10%
And this is for people who
are afraid of family history.

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:26.670 align:middle line:10%
So you have a family
history of diabetes type 2.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:27.470 align:middle line:10%
What do you do?

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:29.690 align:middle line:10%
You begin to look for
people in your family

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:33.020 align:middle line:10%
who didn't have diabetes type 2.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.850 align:middle line:10%
And find out what were the
causes of their health.

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:36.650 align:middle line:10%
LISA: Good point.

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:37.451 align:middle line:10%
That's the reverse.

00:56:37.451 --> 00:56:38.250 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:39.720 align:middle line:10%
What a great conversation.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And we this is so terrific
that you have shed such light

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.660 align:middle line:90%
on a reverse side of medicine.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.690 align:middle line:84%
You've shed light on the
health aspects of everything.

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:54.170 align:middle line:10%
