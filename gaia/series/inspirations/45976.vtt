00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:17.695 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:19.528 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:21.870 align:middle line:84%
We are broadcasting from
the Conscious Life Expo

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
here in Los Angeles,
and joining me is Kaya.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Kaya communicates with
the angelic realm.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.340 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called
"The Source Code," which

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:84%
is a dictionary for
dreams, signs, and symbols.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.455 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it wasn't
always like this for you.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.792 align:middle line:84%
You didn't write a book about
dreams, signs, and symbols

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of
your life, did you?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
You had a big recording
contract, a musical recording

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.079 align:middle line:90%
contract in Canada, right?

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:10%
For over 20 years I
was a recording artist

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:10%
with Sony Music in Canada.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:10%
And my life started
to change completely

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of this
immense success that I had.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.529 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm
feeling all alone.

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Were you not happy
with your life at the time?

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Or was it not true
to who you are?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: I would say that I
was kind of-- the superficial

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
aspect of show business, for
me, was not attracting me.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was creating
lots of questions

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:90%
during that period of time.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And I started to receive dreams,
very, very intense dreams

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and nightmares.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And this started to be so
incredible and so intense

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that I just wanted to
know more about them.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What were
the dreams about?

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Were they terrifying,
or were they peaceful?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Some of the first
dreams that started the whole

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:84%
process-- because then after
I started to receive 10 to 50

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.715 align:middle line:90%
dreams every night.

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you
remembered all of them.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And I still do that after almost
20 years now, every night.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the day, it's a rest
time, because during the night

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
you can travel in
multi dimensions,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.925 align:middle line:90%
and you can help people.

00:02:06.925 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:90%
You can heal people also.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
We have immense potential
within ourselves.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%
So I remember that first dream.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I went for a nap
Saturday afternoon.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And in my dream, it
was so beautiful.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.695 align:middle line:84%
There was a blacksmith that was
up in the sky behind a veil.

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It was all in gold,
and he was so luminous.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I've
always knew him.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And he was like an angel.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to
me, are you ready?

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.325 align:middle line:90%
And I said, ready for what?

00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:90%
And he said, are you ready?

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:90%
We start again.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.135 align:middle line:84%
So I said, but we
start again what?

00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking up at the sky.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And then after that
dream, I started

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:90%
to receive intense nightmares.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And now I know what a
blacksmith means in a dream,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:84%
because my conscience was
forged, completely transformed

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:90%
for months and years.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And this led me to
become a hermit.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What does
the blacksmith mean?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:90%
What did you mean by that?

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: A blacksmith is
a symbol of transforming,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:90%
of forging.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.835 align:middle line:84%
So it was forging my
consciousness, like the hammer.

00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of in my
head and in my energy

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
with different thoughts and
combinations of who I was

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:90%
and what was about to become.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was a mixture of
very, very intense states

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
I was going through.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Was it like
a purging process?

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Yes, it was
initiations, major,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
major initiations
that lasted for many,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:90%
many months and years.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So I've decided to walk
away from fame and glory

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:84%
because I was so interested
also in the notions of dreams.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was like
my new musical child.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.680 align:middle line:10%
Because I was doing that
career for over 20 years or so.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:10%
I was very famous,
and I had the life

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:10%
that everybody can dream of.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:90%
But it was not enough.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Even if I had all this abundance
and money and everything,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.482 align:middle line:84%
I was searching for
something more deeper.

00:04:27.482 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It was unfulfilling.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: And even when I was
an artist, as a musical artist,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
everything that was important
for me was to help people.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:90%
This was always there in me.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was not the kind
of person going in bars

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:90%
and having fun with people.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So I was praying in
my room before a show.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.955 align:middle line:90%
I was very alone in this world.

00:04:52.955 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So it started to
be very intense,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:90%
and all the questioning.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But when the dreams started,
it was so beautiful.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:90%
And I just wanted to know more.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I just plunged in my
unconscious for years and years

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:90%
to understand the Source Code.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now were any of your
songs about healing or angels

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:90%
or loneliness or anything?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.222 align:middle line:84%
The last song that I
wrote was from a very

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:31.055 align:middle line:90%
profound experience.

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Finally Free."

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that
because, as an artist,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:90%
I was helping children.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:90%
So it was very important for me.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I was going very often
to hospitals to help them

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and for those who were in the
transfers of death, et cetera.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So I was there with
them and discussing.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So I got a call
from a young woman.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
She was 19 years old, and she
was about to die from cancer.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said to my
agent at the time

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
that she needed to see me
because she saw me in a dream.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
important because she

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:90%
had a message for me.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So I took the first plane
to go and visit her,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and I had one of the most
profound afternoons of my life.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And so she revealed things to
me that are still secrets today.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.695 align:middle line:84%
And it was explaining the
process of transformation

00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:40.097 align:middle line:90%
that I was going through.

00:06:40.097 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it was the
first time it was made real

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:90%
by someone else.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: That's correct.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Mmm.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: That's correct.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:84%
That was really,
really the first time

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
that someone was
putting words in what I

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:84%
was feeling since
I was a little boy.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, I was
always in meditation,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.229 align:middle line:84%
even when I was
four, five years old.

00:06:59.229 --> 00:06:59.895 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:06:59.895 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: I started to sing
in church at six years old.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So my life was very focused
on connecting with myself

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.475 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Did you ever see
her again in your dreams?

00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: What
happened, actually,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:84%
is after that meeting
that we had together,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:90%
two weeks after she passed away.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:90%
So it was very, very intense.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And during that night, she
came to visit me in a dream.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: She did?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: And she
came to thank me.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me that
they had a gift for me.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So she brought me in
a large black room,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:90%
and there was a long table.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of the
table, there was a square.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.690 align:middle line:90%
It was like a mirror.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And in the mirror, I was able
to see the tunnel of light

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:90%
that we see when we die.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
It was so beautiful,
crystal blues,

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:84%
colors that I have never
seen here on Earth.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me, normally
you have to die to see this.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: So she said, you will
have seen it while you are

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:90%
alive, so don't be shy.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Talk about it.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Your life's going
to be changing,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to be
helping the world eventually

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:84%
with the knowledge
that you are going

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:90%
to bring from that experience.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So then I woke up
in the morning.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of so int--
so I was in tears of joy.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been the
same since that time.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Because when we have
these kinds of experience,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
the lights are so powerful that
all your cells are transformed.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: So this created major,
major reflections about life.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I started to receive 10
to 50 dreams every night.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's still
there until today.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.329 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The song "Finally
Free," did that come from her?

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:90%
It's the story.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: The words?

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: In this song, I talk
about this meeting and this

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:90%
encounter that I had with her.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now can I ask you about
the symbols and how you receive

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.800 align:middle line:90%
these symbols?

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:84%
In the book "The Source
Code," all the symbols

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
that you've written
about you have

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:90%
obtained from the dream world?

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: That's correct.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I started to, because
of all these dreams,

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I was just fascinating, and so I
started to be like a scientist,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
writing everything and living
as a hermit for many years

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:90%
all alone.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So in my country, everyone
thought that I was crazy.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.965 align:middle line:84%
It was all on the
front page of magazines

00:09:45.965 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was kind
of talking about this.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I was not able to explain
what was happening.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know that
I would write about this.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to know
myself, to cleanse my soul.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was a direct
communication with God,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:84%
because dreams are
the language of God.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And through symbolic
language, we

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:84%
can understand that our
life is also like a dream.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So one day we can use symbolic
language not only in dreams

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:84%
but also in our
day-to-day realities.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.616 align:middle line:90%
So I started to work and travel.

00:10:29.616 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first
time that I received

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
a connection that was
helping me to write

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
"The Source Code,"
this dictionary, today.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I was so intense
in the knowledge,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:90%
just wanted to know more.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:90%
So I remember the symbol.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:90%
It was like the table.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.959 align:middle line:84%
I had a table in a dream,
a very simple symbol.

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what is
the meaning of the table?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking and
thinking and thinking.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was so intense
asking, what's

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of this symbol?

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I was kind of very
intense during that time,

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
because I was staying in
bed for 20 hours a day

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:84%
for months and
months and months.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: To get
back to that state?

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.113 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yeah.

00:11:12.113 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to dream.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:90%
That's all I wanted.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I was a little bit extreme,
I have to be honest.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: I don't advise
anyone or anybody to do that,

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
because I could have
lost myself completely.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:90%
I could have lost myself.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:90%
But I just wanted to dream more.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I was not interested in life
anymore for a period of time.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to go there
and see that tunnel of light

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and continue to experiment this
connection and this knowledge.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of
repeating, what's

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of the
table and table?

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:90%
And it was like an equation.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.605 align:middle line:84%
Like a mathematician, I
was trying to make the code

00:11:49.605 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:90%
and understand this reality.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
I started to dream.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And in my dream I
was in a classroom.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a teacher,
and he said, all right,

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
today we're just going to talk
about the symbol of the table.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he wrote the
definition on the board,

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to
remember the definition.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: And then I
just woke up from that.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:90%
It was like, wow.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I've discovered that
the more our intentions are

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
strong, the more we can
travel in parallel worlds

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and go to get the
answer that we need.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the Bible or in many
spiritual texts in the world,

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
it says, just ask
and you will receive.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.381 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know how to ask.

00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: We need to focus.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Because when we ask
something, sometimes we

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.747 align:middle line:84%
have 20 thoughts
at the same time.

00:12:42.747 --> 00:12:43.371 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:12:43.371 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: So we disperse ourself.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We disperse ourself
in our realities also.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
But we do it also in our
mind and in our hearts.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So the more we
meditate, the more

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
we do focus, the
more then we can

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
go exactly where we need to
go and where we need to be.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And at that period
of time, this is

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
where I started to
do angelic mantras,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
to focus and to
dream more and more

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and to go where I just wanted
to go and to find the answers.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What is
an angelic mantra?

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: So that's a beautiful
experience also and beautiful

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I met my wife
Christiane because my story

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
was all over the paper
everywhere in Canada.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I went in a
bookstore in the morning

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:84%
just to get an answer from--
I was searching for symbols.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had a dream
with King Solomon,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was in the
time of Jerusalem

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:84%
in front of the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
princess that was there,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and there was a marriage
that was about to happen.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.325 align:middle line:84%
They were all in
precious stones.

00:13:52.325 --> 00:13:54.254 align:middle line:84%
It was so beautiful,
so beautiful.

00:13:54.254 --> 00:13:56.295 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you went to
look up that time period?

00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.008 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: So I just wanted
to know a little more about

00:13:59.008 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:84%
the King Solomon, because I
didn't know exactly who he was.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I knew he was from
the Bible, but I

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%
don't come from a
very religious family,

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:90%
so I didn't know all of this.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:90%
So I just wanted to know more.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I went to a church at
7:00 AM in the morning,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:90%
but the church was closed.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So I needed to wait at 10:00
AM to go to a bookstore

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to get information
about King Solomon.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Now do you believe that
you traveled to a parallel time

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
where King Solomon
existed in your dream?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: That's a very,
very interesting question.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Because in parallel worlds,
sometimes you can travel

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and the symbols
are representations

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
of your own consciousness,
because they represent

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:84%
qualities and weaknesses
or forces of capacities

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So we had at our table,
at our booth today,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
there was a man that
came to the table.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it's so funny.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.815 align:middle line:84%
I always have dreams
with the presidents.

00:14:56.815 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:84%
The President of
the United States,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:84%
sometimes he's there
with the presidents

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:90%
of Australia and whatever.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
There's many people at the same
time, these powerful people.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And he was a CPA and everything.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:90%
So he said, I'm just a CPA.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, yeah,
but you know what?

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
When you have your clients,
it's very easy for you

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:90%
to talk to very powerful people.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do
this in the dream,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
then you can talk about politics
and important decisions,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, and you will feel
very, very at ease with that.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And probably you meet
millionaires, et cetera,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and you don't feel
disturbed by that.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
You are like, these
are normal people.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And you are a person that can
connect with major decisions.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So he was kind of
looking at me [GASPS].

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:90%
So I said, they are part of you.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So the President of
the United States,

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
at the present time when you
receive that in the morning,

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:90%
it is you also.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:84%
You are the president,
and you are yourself.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:84%
You're meeting a part of you,
potential that you have within.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So in parallel worlds,
sometimes we visit ourself.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.955 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes also we can
travel in time in the past,

00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
in the present,
or in the future,

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and we can see and
meet through realities.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:90%
So both aspects are possible.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you see aspects
of your consciousness,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
but you can also travel in
parallel universes as yourself

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:90%
in another space and time.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.388 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: That's correct, yes.

00:16:34.388 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:90%
And you can help people.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.180 align:middle line:90%
You can heal people.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
You can see information
that are probabilities

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.674 align:middle line:84%
that are in preparations
to be manifested.

00:16:44.674 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And I want to
learn about how you set

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.021 align:middle line:84%
your intentions before you
go into that dream state.

00:16:49.021 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted you
to finish the story

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:84%
about King Solomon and your
wife and how you met your wife.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: So I got to this
book shop at 10:00 AM

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the owner
of the bookshop

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:84%
knew a little bit of my story,
because I was the hermit now,

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.442 align:middle line:90%
the crazy man of the village.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:90%
And the village is a big one.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.274 align:middle line:90%
It's a country.

00:17:07.274 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So then he saw
me, and he said, I

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:84%
know someone that
knows about symbols.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:90%
She's from Switzerland.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.480 align:middle line:84%
She just arrived in the
region, so maybe you

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.630 align:middle line:90%
can have a chat with her.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:90%
So I said, all right.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, give me
your phone number,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.785 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see if she
wants to share with you

00:17:26.785 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:90%
and discuss with you.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:90%
So then the connection was done.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, just a day
after, I spoke with her.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I've
always knew her.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to open myself more.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the
time when I was talking

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.806 align:middle line:90%
people were a little bit afraid.

00:17:44.806 --> 00:17:45.305 align:middle line:90%
And I went--

00:17:45.305 --> 00:17:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You finally found
someone you could talk to.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.153 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: --a priest.

00:17:47.153 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
I went to see everybody.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to know about
all these dreams and all,

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:84%
because I had powerful
initiations sometimes,

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.750 align:middle line:84%
powerful nightmares, and
also beautiful dreams.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it was all
mixed up sometimes,

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.105 align:middle line:84%
so it took me a long time
to put that in order.

00:18:04.105 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Did you at any time
feel like you were going crazy

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.901 align:middle line:90%
or losing your mind?

00:18:07.901 --> 00:18:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: No.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Never, never.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I was meeting God.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: I really felt
that from the beginning.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the
nightmares right away--

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
it was like there was this
knowledge that was already

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:90%
in me.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And every time that
I was doing a step,

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
it was like I knew this process.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I knew this process
of transformation.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So I based myself on
prayers and meditation.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was a
purification process,

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and nightmares were
there to make me stronger

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.430 align:middle line:90%
and not to make me weak.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And not to scare
you but yet to de-layer you

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:90%
in a way, your psyche.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So, how do you teach--
Well, I actually

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.709 align:middle line:84%
want to go back to the angels,
the names of the angels.

00:18:58.709 --> 00:18:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So my wife at that time,
for almost two years

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
we were friends, and she
was like a sister for me.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I received in dream that
she would be my wife.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.810 align:middle line:90%
And I was even talking to God.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Are you testing me again?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I was like a monk,
and I thought that, for me,

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:90%
being with someone was over.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I just wanted
to serve humanity,

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted to dream more
and to understand myself more.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So I was really, really
in intense meditation.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So she was about to
share her own research

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
about the traditional
study of angels, which

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
is the origin of
angels as we know them

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
in our Christian
and Jewish faith.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So all the names, we
know Michael, Gabriel,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Raphael, but at the
origin there were

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:90%
72 angels and 10 archangels.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And all these
names are connected

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to pure qualities
and powers of God.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So an angel is not a
person at the origin.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.749 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: It is a quality.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.515 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's a vibration?

00:20:10.515 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: It's a vibration.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of consciousness
that represents powers.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:84%
When she presented that, for me
dreams were all my equations,

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:90%
and I was living in dream state.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:10%
So I automatically
associated angels

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:10%
with dreams, because
it's a human with wings.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:10%
So wings are the
representation of our capacity

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:10%
to dream and to travel
in the multidimensions

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.750 align:middle line:10%
of our consciousness,
to develop clairvoyance,

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:10%
clairsentience, clairaudience,
develop our spiritual powers.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And she shared with me
that she was doing mantras

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:84%
with the names of the angels,
because she studied yoga

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:84%
in India, and she
was a therapist,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and she started to do
the angelic mantras.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning,
she didn't know

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that it would start intense
initiations and the capacity

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to open the consciousness
in such an intense way.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So then, for me,
it was kind of wow.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.660 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: A whole nother level.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:22.618 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Oh, yes.

00:21:22.618 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And so she gave
me this knowledge.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:84%
She presented to
me this knowledge.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the 72 angels were
rediscovered only in 1975

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:90%
in Girona, Spain.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was hidden
for over 500 years

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:90%
because of the Inquisition.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And the origin of
angels have been

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.952 align:middle line:84%
rediscovered at
that period of time.

00:21:46.952 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Through texts?

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Yes, through texts
that were written in Hebrew,

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Catalan, and Spanish.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It was a mixture of
languages to keep it secret.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And then she has been in contact
with the first books that

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:84%
have been just
written about that,

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.295 align:middle line:90%
and they were not very popular.

00:22:07.295 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:84%
They were just
explaining the angels

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:84%
more in a sort of astrology
way of having qualities,

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, developing qualities.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But she started to do the
mantra because of the yoga

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and because of the
meditation, and then it

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:84%
started to do an extraordinary
spiritual path that

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:84%
was like creating a spiritual
autonomy to receive answers

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:90%
from within.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So right away, she showed me the
72 angels, and in three weeks,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:84%
right after we met
for the first time,

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I started even to do the
mantras of all the 72 angels

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:90%
all in cycles.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.101 align:middle line:90%
I was very intense.

00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Could you share with
us some of the names that came

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:90%
through?

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes, of course.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So the angel number one is
Vehuiah, so Jeliel, Sitael,

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Elemiah, Mahasiah, Melahel,
Lelahel, Chevakiah.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.350 align:middle line:84%
All these names are
very, very ancient

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:90%
from the beginning of time.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's even what
the lost treasure

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:84%
of the alliance that
people-- the Ark of Covenant

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:90%
is the 72 angels.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I had this
dream with the King Solomon.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Because by meeting
my wife, I was

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:84%
about to discover the
knowledge of the ancient time

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.660 align:middle line:90%
about angels.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And so then I started to
do mantras intensively,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and I started to
receive dreams that

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
were associated with the
angels that I was working with.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Because an angel is a
state of consciousness.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So Vehuiah, for example,
is related to divine power.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It's related to divine
will, our capacity

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to begin something, one,
the one, who we are.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:90%
We start a new way.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Two is Jeliel, relationship
with others, love, wisdom.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the notions
of relationship.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Three, it's like mom,
dad, and a child.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a construction.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So all the numbers are not
just there by coincidence.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:13.677 align:middle line:84%
They are the fundamental
aspects of numerology.

00:24:13.677 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you started
to put all this together.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.566 align:middle line:84%
You were discovering the
great mystery of the world.

00:24:18.566 --> 00:24:19.565 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: It was amazing.

00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: It was amazing.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe now--
because now in the United

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.320 align:middle line:84%
States this is very
new, this teaching.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.395 align:middle line:84%
But now we have millions
of students, my wife and I,

00:24:29.395 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
in many, many countries
around the world that

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:90%
are doing angel mantras like us.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And they have their own path,
their own spiritual autonomy,

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
their own dreams and
their own capacity

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
to discover their
spiritual capacities.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Even children, they can do
that, and it creates a focus

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
so they have dreams that are
related to their questions,

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.470 align:middle line:90%
because you can ask a question.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's very amazing.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Can you teach us how
to do that, what you just did?

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
It sounded like the
most beautiful song.

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Angel mantras are extraordinary.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:84%
For example,
Michael, so we can--

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Mikhael, Mikhael, Mikhael,
Mikhael, oh, Mikhael,

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Mikhael, Mikhael.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.360 align:middle line:90%
We can sing it.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
We can do it in
silence, especially

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:90%
if you're in the bus.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I recommend not to do it
out loud, unless you may--

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.865 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Make some
instant friends.

00:25:25.865 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes, exactly.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But you can do this while you do
meditation, you do the dishes,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:90%
you do sports.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you do,
you have the mantra.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I was talking
about, creating a focus,

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:90%
a concentration.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.082 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: A calling
in of that vibration.

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Exactly.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And all your cells
are integrating

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:90%
angelic consciousness.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, for me now,
I truly believe--

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and I can say that in
front of the camera

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:84%
with all my heart and soul--
that I think that being human

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:90%
is not enough.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.145 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:26:00.145 --> 00:26:00.853 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: We're all here to
become angels, to develop.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:84%
All of us, we're all here to
discover our spiritual powers

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.170 align:middle line:90%
and capacities.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And one day, when
you receive dreams

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to
understand them,

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.390 align:middle line:84%
it's like you have no more
limitations of your spirit.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: To even bring in that
consciousness of these angelic

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:84%
beings, it must have
felt overwhelming to you.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Or was it just a knowing?

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Was it a peace?

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:90%
What was that feeling?

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.876 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: At the beginning,
it was not a peace.

00:26:33.876 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to understand
that when we start to do mantra

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.700 align:middle line:84%
there's human
distortions that are

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.057 align:middle line:90%
linked to the angelic qualities.

00:26:40.057 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: What do you mean?

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: An angel is a pure
state of consciousness of God.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:90%
But us, we are not perfect.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
invoke the angel,

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:84%
then we have to
transform our unconscious

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:90%
and cleanse the memories.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Because our soul is
like a living computer.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:84%
We record positive
and negative memories

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:90%
throughout our experiences.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we start
to invoke an angel,

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
then you start to
receive sometimes

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:84%
very intense purification
dreams and nightmares that

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
are explaining in sort of
percentage what you have inside

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.250 align:middle line:84%
of us that you need to
transform so then you

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:90%
will reach to angelic qualities.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Because in physics we say that
everything can be transformed.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Nothing loses itself.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
transformation of energy.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So being impatient, the
only way to become patient,

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.362 align:middle line:84%
to have more patience is
to cleanse the impatience--

00:27:41.362 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Were you cleansing--

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.236 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: --because
it's the same energy.

00:27:44.236 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: --not only your own
consciousness but, for lack

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
of a better word, the
consciousness of man?

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Were you cleansing and
purifying human consciousness

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:56.729 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:27:56.729 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:84%
You have a very
profound question.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.660 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning,
of course, we enter

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:08.140 align:middle line:84%
in our personal unconscious
and family unconscious.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to
visit these memories.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But the more you go deeper
and deeper in the work,

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:84%
in angel work, the
more you reach a level

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness of
humanity and even the forces

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.390 align:middle line:90%
that you integrate in you.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But also you need
to visit initiations

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and major negativity.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I understand.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Not completely, but I understand
what you're talking about.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So how would we use
this in our daily life,

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
not from a way of wanting
to create the red car?

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But how do you create and
manifest in your daily life,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and how do you teach
people to do this?

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: So it's a very simple
work to start to do angel

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.310 align:middle line:90%
mantras.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
You start to do it, and you
have to be very intense.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the more you
concentrate yourself,

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:84%
the more you discipline
your consciousness,

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:90%
the more you have results.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like in life.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.310 align:middle line:84%
If you don't work,
you don't have money.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
do inner work, you

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
don't have spiritual energy
at a very high level.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
using spirituality--

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:84%
it's more like a
spiritual vacation.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So they do not marry
spirit and matter.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.364 align:middle line:84%
There's a discrepancy,
a major one.

00:29:30.364 --> 00:29:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Where you
have that experience,

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.446 align:middle line:84%
and then you go
back to your life.

00:29:33.446 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Yeah, Sunday they're
doing community service.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:90%
They go to church.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.690 align:middle line:90%
They are wonderful citizen.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of the
week they just do business,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and they are not
necessarily right.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.740 align:middle line:90%
They're competing.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They're always trying
to-- ambitions,

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, greed, and everything
can be part of their life.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that life is a
spiritual experience.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:84%
We're only here to
marry spirit and matter.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:90%
We are a test.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:90%
We are being tested every time.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And for me, my life
now is like a dream.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:90%
You are a part of me.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:90%
I am a part of you.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:84%
We are now experimenting
a state of consciousness

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:84%
of communication, of
sharing with the world.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
based on evolution,

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
on qualities, the
development qualities,

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:90%
the improvement of who we are.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's a long process.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a long process,
but it's easy.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
People can start to
do angel mantras.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Then if they don't
dream, after two or three

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:84%
weeks of very intense
mantras, they're

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.170 align:middle line:84%
going to start to
receive their own dreams.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:39.962 align:middle line:90%
And that's amazing.

00:30:39.962 --> 00:30:41.711 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: How do you
remember those dreams?

00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you get asked
this question all the time.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: You need to
cleanse the needs,

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:84%
the personal needs of the humans
that we have inside of us.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
sometimes too tired.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
They wake up in the
middle of the night,

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh, I had
a dream, but, ooh, I'm

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:90%
so tired, and this and this.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:10.284 align:middle line:84%
So I say to these people,
God is talking to you.

00:31:10.284 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Listen.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: It's like, listen.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:90%
You cannot say I'm too tired.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.312 align:middle line:84%
You've been praying
to have this opening.

00:31:17.312 --> 00:31:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Then you receive a
dream, and then you're

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:90%
too tired to write it down.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:90%
So get an iPad and do it.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:90%
I do it on iPad.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very modern sage,
so I do it with my iPad.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.587 align:middle line:90%
And it's like the little--

00:31:30.587 --> 00:31:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's light.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.405 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: I have a tablet, and I
have the light and everything,

00:31:34.405 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:90%
and I write this down.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I just do it in a sense
where you just keep yourself

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:90%
between, just in between.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.630 align:middle line:90%
You don't wake up yourself.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't try to analyze
your dream right away.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:90%
You just put it down.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
a question of focus

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.849 align:middle line:84%
and of saying to yourself,
this is so important.

00:31:54.849 --> 00:31:55.765 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And practice.

00:31:55.765 --> 00:31:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure the more--

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: And practice.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.624 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --you do it, yeah.

00:31:57.624 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: And the more
your willpower, you know,

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:84%
the more you want
to be connected,

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.752 align:middle line:84%
the more the
connection is stronger.

00:32:05.752 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And then
when you wake up,

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.889 align:middle line:84%
you could look in the book for
some of the symbols that come

00:32:10.889 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:90%
to you through the dream?

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.086 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What do you hear are
some of the themes that seem

00:32:16.086 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:90%
to be coming through?

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if what
you're saying is true

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and the angelic realm
is truly communicating

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:84%
through our
consciousness, are there

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
messages that they're trying to
communicate through to humanity

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:31.585 align:middle line:84%
or that this vibration that's
raising wants us to know about?

00:32:31.585 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: The first
real message--

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:90%
You're going to laugh.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
The first real message that the
angels are giving us in dreams

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.100 align:middle line:90%
is toilets.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Toilets.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: We receive
dreams of purification.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.446 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ah.

00:32:47.446 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Some people are just
having angelic experiences with

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.440 align:middle line:84%
great lines and saying,
all right, the universe,

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and there's a change
of time of humanity.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.740 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we need
to marry spirit and matter.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And to become what we
connect when we challenge

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and when we are in sync
with these great principles

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and values, we need
then to integrate them.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it creates a
major transformation in us.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:27.040 align:middle line:84%
It's good to say
something beautiful.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But to live it,
it's another thing.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Can you connect
with that vibration during

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.310 align:middle line:84%
the waking day and not
necessarily always in the dream

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.810 align:middle line:90%
state?

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:37.351 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:33:37.351 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, with
the angelic work,

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.750 align:middle line:84%
we receive lucid
dreams all the time.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: For me, I have
integrated the Source Code

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:46.795 align:middle line:90%
in me.

00:33:46.795 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You have?

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:51.142 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: So for me, I
see symbols everywhere.

00:33:51.142 --> 00:33:52.105 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Such as?

00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: States
of consciousness.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, for
me, there's always

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.420 align:middle line:90%
a connection that can happen.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I can see someone
walking in a certain way.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I know what state
of consciousness

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.710 align:middle line:84%
he's got inside of him just
by the way he's walking.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Just the way that a
person's going to dress,

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:84%
then you can understand
certain aspects

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.810 align:middle line:84%
of the personality,
the great outlines.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:90%
So there are signs everywhere.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:20.080 align:middle line:84%
You go in an
apartment, for example.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The decoration of an apartment
is the representation

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.600 align:middle line:84%
of the intimate
aspects of the soul.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I see.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Because you create
yourself through matter.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So we can understand
symbols, and then you

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
can see the essence that
people have in them.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you're not walking
around seeing keys and stars

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:90%
and crosses.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.920 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing energy as a whole.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.139 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: I can talk to
someone, for example,

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and then I can have a
vision at the same time.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It's so intense that
it's so natural for me.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I can see a bear.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:53.499 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And then
you communicate it.

00:34:53.499 --> 00:34:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Let's say the person is
talking, and then I see a bear.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.445 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I see.

00:34:56.445 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: And then I know that
the person's got intense needs.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course she's going
to be talking intensively.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:84%
[GRUMBLING AND GROWLING]
And the essence of the bear

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.770 align:middle line:84%
will be in the person
at that present time.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:13.060 align:middle line:90%
So I can hear words.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I can have songs.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I can have a vision.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:90%
I can sense things.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:21.610 align:middle line:84%
All my senses are now
very, very, very open.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:27.860 align:middle line:84%
The angelic consciousness, when
you develop it, it's amazing.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.757 align:middle line:84%
And of course you can
anticipate life, future.

00:35:31.757 --> 00:35:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.420 align:middle line:84%
About the themes, did
you notice that there

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.530 align:middle line:90%
were themes coming in?

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Did you answer that?

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.822 align:middle line:84%
Because I might have gone into
another realm at that moment.

00:35:41.822 --> 00:35:42.405 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yeah.

00:35:42.405 --> 00:35:43.606 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:43.606 --> 00:35:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I'm a secret
agent now of the universe--

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: --in a sense that
the more you go deep inside

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and the more you open yourself,
the more you have a lot

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:90%
of secrets.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:84%
You know a lot of
things about the future.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's important not to
reveal these information most

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.920 align:middle line:90%
of the time.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.240 align:middle line:90%
You can participate.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:90%
You can help.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.570 align:middle line:84%
You can understand
people, because you

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:84%
have seen what's going
to happen to them.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we have to respect
the life plan of the person.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And we really need to make
sure before we interfere

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:26.680 align:middle line:84%
in a program to make sure it's
going to be right to do that.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Unless they're just going
to cut the information,

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
get the information.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if something
has to happen

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
for a person and that
person because of that

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:41.110 align:middle line:84%
she will be managing a
multinational nonprofit

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:47.150 align:middle line:84%
organization to help people
that have cancer, for example,

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to bring
such a beautiful message

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:54.940 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, so maybe she's
going through that illness.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.850 align:middle line:90%
It is difficult.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't see what is going
to happen for her in the future.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But then you can
see that in dream,

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and then you can understand
the process of difficulties,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that evil is educational,
that nightmares

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and even difficulties
in life are the same.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.700 align:middle line:84%
They are a challenge, and they
are there to help us to evolve.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So to have access to
knowledge, we really

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:84%
need to master good and evil in
the sense where we understand

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.620 align:middle line:84%
it as an educational process
and not as a punishment.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So in terms of
the future of our world,

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.670 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be able to really
say what you've seen because it

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:40.460 align:middle line:84%
could be too shocking and
jarring and we need to go

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.549 align:middle line:90%
through the process?

00:37:41.549 --> 00:37:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Sometimes.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
it sometimes, yes.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.575 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes not.

00:37:48.575 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's, ah, it's really
important to-- I receive--

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.852 align:middle line:84%
I do premonitory
dreams every night.

00:37:56.852 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: What kind of dreams?

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: Even this TV show,
I was with some of you during

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.690 align:middle line:90%
the night.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I knew your faces already.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is normal for me
to see in advance people

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to meet.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Because our soul,
there's a meeting.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.710 align:middle line:90%
There's something.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.770 align:middle line:90%
There's a connection.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And if the universe wants that
this thing will happen, then

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.000 align:middle line:84%
in dreams you can
visit the thoughts

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of probabilities of
what's going to happen.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:90%
And then you can see the energy.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
attraction, the affinities.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you can deal
with that information

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:90%
to manifest yourself well.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What is your
overall message with this?

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.740 align:middle line:84%
What is the goal that
you want to communicate

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.555 align:middle line:84%
to people about this type of
symbolism and communication

00:38:43.555 --> 00:38:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and the Source Code?

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: I think symbolic
language is one of the most

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:90%
and will be...

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:84%
in the future will be one of
the most important knowledge

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.040 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Because with symbolic language,
you can interpret your dreams.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.070 align:middle line:84%
You can have access to
a spiritual autonomy.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But also, with
symbolic language,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:07.370 align:middle line:84%
you can analyze the
drawings of your child.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:84%
You can understand when
the child is talking

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.820 align:middle line:84%
with incoherent aspects but
he's talking in symbols.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
You can understand that
if you talk to your spouse

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and he's just mad because the
New York Rangers lost a game,

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.010 align:middle line:84%
you understand that he's
talking about himself.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:84%
He's not talking
about the Rangers.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about his capacity
to win and to succeed in life.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.480 align:middle line:84%
He's talking always
about himself.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.020 align:middle line:84%
People are always talking
in symbols all the time.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:49.130 align:middle line:84%
They are working, they are
loving, they are caring,

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.140 align:middle line:84%
they are helping
for the only reason

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to experiment and to develop
and improve themselves

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.282 align:middle line:90%
through their realities.

00:39:57.282 --> 00:39:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And to expand.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: And to expand.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Do you see that most
people that you come in contact

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.470 align:middle line:84%
with have that innate
desire to love?

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Or do you see that there is a
fall from that grace in people?

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: You see love.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:90%
There's multidimensions to love.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
they love, but they

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:24.095 align:middle line:84%
are going through a process
of infidelity with someone.

00:40:24.095 --> 00:40:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.088 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: And they say they
love, but at the same time

00:40:27.088 --> 00:40:30.220 align:middle line:84%
they're breaking the life of
someone and of the children.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And they are just,
like, at the restaurant

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.850 align:middle line:84%
with the beautiful
candles, and they

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.920 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
that it is not love.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.910 align:middle line:90%
It is an illusion of love.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people,
they do not know.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we have
veil in our consciousness.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Veils are there to help us.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a law in
the universe that

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.990 align:middle line:84%
is called illusion
is educational.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.460 align:middle line:84%
A person will be
in her own bubble,

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and she's going to think that
she's right, that she's really,

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.210 align:middle line:90%
really having a great life.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
necessarily the same

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:09.495 align:middle line:84%
if you look at in a perspective
of angelic qualities.

00:41:09.495 --> 00:41:12.200 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is why you
see through that--

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you meet your friend,
and she's just saying to you,

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:20.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm in love.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.162 align:middle line:90%
I just fall in love.

00:41:22.162 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:84%
When you use the
word fall in love,

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
it's like, hmm, you're
going to have problems,

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.880 align:middle line:84%
because falling you're
going to hurt yourself.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So even in symbolic lang--
in the words that we use,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:90%
we talk about ourself.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:90%
We talk about our fears.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we just
the word awesome.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: How-some?

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.398 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Awesome?

00:41:44.398 --> 00:41:46.098 align:middle line:90%
When we say this is awesome.

00:41:46.098 --> 00:41:47.046 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Awesome, yes.

00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> KAYA: When you analyze
it, it's like, oh.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.760 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.360 align:middle line:10%
So all the words that
sometimes we say,

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.410 align:middle line:10%
we are so happy to succeed
that at the same time

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.800 align:middle line:10%
we fear of not succeeding,
so we use words

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:10%
that are inverse of what
we really want to say.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite interesting.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.829 align:middle line:84%
When you know
symbolic language--

00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You must look at things
in such a different way than

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:12.200 align:middle line:90%
most people.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And it must be such
a fascinating life

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:19.220 align:middle line:84%
as well, to go through seeing
things in such a different way.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Yes.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I appreciate
you being here.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And your book, it's immense,
and your symbols are incredible.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:30.870 align:middle line:10%
All of this came
from the dream space.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.690 align:middle line:10%
It's just incredible.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: It's been a great joy.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Sharing your knowledge,
sharing your experience

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.129 align:middle line:84%
and your essence with
us and your treasurers.

00:42:42.129 --> 00:42:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Thank you.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Thank you so much.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:44.841 align:middle line:90%
>> KAYA: Thank you.

00:42:44.841 --> 00:42:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And if you would
like to watch a replay

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:84%
of my interview with Kaya,
you can go to gaiamtv.com.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:43:10.600 align:middle line:90%
