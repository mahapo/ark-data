00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.040 align:middle line:10%
We are broadcasting from
beautiful downtown Denver

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.580 align:middle line:10%
at the Hay House "I
Can Do It!" conference.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:10%
So did you know
that the number one

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:10%
goal that people have
worldwide is to be happy?

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:90%
So are you happy?

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Does the phrase "life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness"

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:90%
mean that we don't have it?

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.590 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean?

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So joining me today is
psychologist and the director

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:84%
of the Happiness
Project, Robert Holden.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
He's been teaching people all
over the world about happiness

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:90%
for 15 years.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
He teaches a course
called Be Happy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a course with a set
of scientific principles

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and exercises that have been
called a genuine fast track

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:90%
to happiness.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you like to do
that a little bit more?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.745 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT HOLDEN: Yay.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, Lisa.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.247 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So happiness--
why teach about happiness?

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Because it's what
we want, just like you said.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.663 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like I said, yeah.

00:01:05.663 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLDEN: You know, when you ask
people all over the world, what

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:10%
is it you most want, number
one answer is happiness.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:10%
When you ask people all
over the world, what

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:10%
is you most want
for your children,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:10%
number one answer is happiness.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:10%
It's just in us.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:10%
We want that experience
of happiness.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.075 align:middle line:10%
It's there from the beginning,
and it's always on our mind.

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But why
don't we have it?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Why are we always in pursuit
of it, like the phrase says,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.685 align:middle line:84%
at least in America, that
"pursuit of happiness?"

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, isn't
that interesting?

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Something's happened along
the way where we clearly

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.705 align:middle line:84%
got a little bit
confused, haven't we?

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:39.622 align:middle line:84%
Let's take that phrase
"pursuit of happiness,"

00:01:39.622 --> 00:01:40.955 align:middle line:90%
because it's really interesting.

00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.323 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.
"Pursuit of happiness"

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:44.674 align:middle line:90%
has potentially two meanings.

00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really
down to the word

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:84%
"pursuit," because
"pursuit" can either

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.992 align:middle line:90%
mean to take an interest in--

00:01:51.992 --> 00:01:53.575 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, meaning
you don't have it.

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:55.197 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: --or to chase it.

00:01:55.197 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Now, for
me, to have the right

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
to take an interest
in happiness,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
to have the right to
inquire into the true nature

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
of happiness, that's
a beautiful thing.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But to chase happiness,
that's where,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
for me, the great mistake
lies, because the moment

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
you think you have
to chase happiness,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe you have misunderstood
what true happiness is.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So right there in that
phrase and in that word

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
"pursuit," is almost like
where we've got two roads.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
We could either get really
interested in what happiness is

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and get clear on what
it is, or we go chasing.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's because we go
chasing that I think,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
actually, the road to happiness
becomes a never-ending road.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:90%
We never actually get that.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.119 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is
interesting, because it's

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:90%
on the Statue of Liberty.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And it says, we have
life, we have liberty,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:90%
but we don't have happiness.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:90%
That's what it says.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
To me, it says that
we don't have it.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.485 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is
outside of ourselves.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: That's the great
mistake that we make.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when I created
the Happiness Project,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
initially, part of the reasoning
for creating the project

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
was because I realized I didn't
know anything about happiness.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd been trained
as a psychologist.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:90%
I'd been trained in philosophy.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And in my entire training was
really a study of unhappiness.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.055 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking at all the
reasons why we're unhappy.

00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And one day, it
occurred to me, maybe

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:84%
we're unhappy because we
don't know what happiness is.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
In six years of study,
I only had one lecture

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:90%
on happiness, only one lecture.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.646 align:middle line:90%
That's not much.

00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In London is
where you studied?

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Actually, no.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I studied in the
middle of England,

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:90%
in a place called Birmingham.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: But fundamentally,
the entire study,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.790 align:middle line:84%
if I was to break it down for
you, year one and year two

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:90%
was Introductory Suffering.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Year three and year four
was Advanced Suffering.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Year five and year six
was Inspired Suffering.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything we
studied in psychology

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
was problems-- diagnoses,
problems, unhappiness.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a good study.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But fundamentally, the thing
we missed was happiness.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And it just occurred
to me that actually,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
maybe the whole
reason we're unhappy

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
is because we're not clear
what real happiness is.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
That's been, basically,
the fundamental basis

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
of my work with the
Happiness Project.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is is that most
people don't need more therapy.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:90%
What they need is more clarity.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
more clarity, that

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%
becomes incredibly therapeutic.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
That helps us to understand
not just what happiness is,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:90%
but who we are.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And when we get
clear, that's when

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.847 align:middle line:90%
I think we get to be happier.

00:04:28.847 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it's a good point.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I was doing some research before
the interview on forbes.com.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And it said that America is
actually ranked 11th overall--

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and this changes all the
time, but recently-- overall

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the world's
happiest countries, Norway

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:90%
being number one.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And they then continued to
relate happiness to money.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So the more financial status
that a country would have,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:90%
the more happy the people were.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.071 align:middle line:84%
Why are happiness and
money always linked?

00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Well, they're
not always linked.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.805 align:middle line:84%
It's just that in those
types of studies--

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the media, yeah.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
In those types of
studies, happiness

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
is defined specifically
here as satisfaction.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, we have to get clear
on what happiness really is.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest there's
three types of happiness.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
One type of happiness
is pleasure.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Pleasure is the
enjoyment of the senses.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
It's to do with why I will like
coffee and somebody else won't.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It's why some of us like
milk chocolate and some of us

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:90%
like dark chocolate.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
It's why some of us listen to
Barry Manilow records and some

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.480 align:middle line:90%
of us don't.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, fundamentally, that
is pleasure and pain happening

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's one
type of happiness.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Another type of happiness
is satisfaction.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I am happy because.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, most happiness
research in the mainstream

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:90%
is based around satisfaction.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy because.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's an important
type of happiness.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But there is one other
type of happiness.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And that type of
happiness I call joy.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, joy is something
else altogether.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Joy is unreasonable
happiness, because joy

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:90%
doesn't need a reason.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need a because.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It's something
completely different.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So fundamentally, again,
the most important thing

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
is is whenever anybody is
talking about happiness,

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
whenever you are talking about
happiness, make sure you know

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:84%
what you're talking
about, because we all

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
have very different definitions
of what happiness is.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing, individually,

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.512 align:middle line:84%
is that we know
what we're talking

00:06:38.512 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
about when we're
talking about happiness.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's
interesting, because there's

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:90%
a slew of books on happiness.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You've done the
study on happiness.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Talk to us about the
project that you did,

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:84%
the Happiness Project, that the
BBC did the documentary around.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: OK, so--

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.461 align:middle line:10%
>>HOLDEN: --when I created
the Happiness Project,

00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:10%
that was in 1992.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:10%
I created it on the
National Health Service.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And all the way up until then,
I had been studying unhappiness

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and helping people to try to
get over their unhappiness.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the equation
I was working to,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, was, if I can help you
get over your unhappiness,

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:84%
you will then go
away and be happy.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:90%
That was the deal.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.206 align:middle line:90%
I never saw it happen.

00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: I would
help people overcome

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:90%
one cause of unhappiness.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And instead of them then
going away and being happy,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
just before they were
about to be happy,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:90%
another unhappiness came up.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:90%
And another unhappiness came up.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And so one day I just
decided, you know,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to get to
happiness, truly, then

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
we mustn't wait until
we're not unhappy.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
What we've got to do
is we've got to say,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to explore
happiness now.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Right in the middle of
the mess of my life,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
right in this imperfect moment
that I'm living in, right here,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start to
look at what happiness is.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And originally, our
first mission statement

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
at the Happiness Project
was "talk happiness."

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's start talking
about happiness,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:84%
because happiness is
the number one goal.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But actually, genuinely,
if you ask people, have

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
you talked to your parents
ever about happiness,

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
have you talked to your
partner ever about happiness,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:84%
have you talked with your
friends ever about happiness,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.326 align:middle line:84%
the answer is either
"no" or "seldom."

00:08:24.326 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience,
one of the first things

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:84%
we can do to get really
clear on happiness

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.849 align:middle line:90%
is let's start talking about it.

00:08:29.849 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's start talking about
it with the people that

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:84%
matter most to us to see if we
can start to get clear on it.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So that, for me,
is where you begin.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I began.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did you
find that the biggest

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:84%
source of unhappiness
is for people?

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.544 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Chasing happiness.

00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:46.585 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's that, huh?

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:47.765 align:middle line:90%
It's chasing it.

00:08:47.765 --> 00:08:49.046 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Unhappiness
sources would

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
be loss, a financial
devastation, all those things?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: All of those matter.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But fundamentally, I created
the Happiness Project

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to help people to give up
the search for happiness,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
because, really, the
search for happiness

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:90%
is what causes all of the pain.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I basically made a
proposition, which

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
was that there is a
world of difference

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
between the search for happiness
and following your joy, two

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:90%
totally different paradigms.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
The search for happiness places
happiness outside of you.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a chase.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And you enter a
paradigm of becoming.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to become happy.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Not yet-- soon, really soon,
hopefully, but not yet.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have to
chase the happiness in order

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
to chase it down.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.389 align:middle line:84%
Following your joy is
entirely different.

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
can even feel it,

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:90%
but it's quite a lovely thing.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like, chasing happiness,
I'm out of breath already.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Following my joy,
hold on a minute--

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm now tuning into something
that's already here.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.116 align:middle line:90%
It's really cool.

00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have
a great exercise

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
you took me through before
called "happiness is."

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And you had me repeat this
like 11 times or something.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
from giving you

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
the textbook answer to
completely crying and then

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
going into what
actually what it was.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was, for me, a perfect
example of what you probably

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:84%
experience with the
Happiness Project

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:84%
as people tell you what they
think it is and then realize

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:84%
they don't have it, because
we've been chasing it

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
for so long, and then
ultimately understanding

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:90%
that it is right here.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was the laughter,
that great laughter,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
of my child-- that
awesome, incredible sound

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.935 align:middle line:84%
that just reverberates
through my heart.

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:84%
It just makes my
whole body tingle.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.055 align:middle line:90%
And I love that sound.

00:10:48.055 --> 00:10:49.136 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: I know.

00:10:49.136 --> 00:10:50.260 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful, isn't it?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.095 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is
that my daughter left me

00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
a voice message once
on my cell phone.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.375 align:middle line:84%
And I kept it, because
in the message,

00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:90%
she was belly laughing so hard.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm ever out of
town and away or whatever,

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll go back in and I'll listen.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:90%
It takes me right there.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is that
feeling of total joy,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:84%
like you experience
that elation.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So in the project,
though, did you

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:84%
ever get to that
level with people?

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.102 align:middle line:90%
Did they ever stop chasing?

00:11:19.102 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: All the time.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, all the time.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And what we did was we created
an eight-week happiness

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the program
that's called "Be Happy."

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was, I felt, a
good enough amount of time

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.360 align:middle line:84%
to help people really make that
shift from chasing happiness

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.965 align:middle line:90%
to following your joy.

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And we did that over a number
of different exercises.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.785 align:middle line:84%
But I guess we started with
getting clear on what happiness

00:11:45.785 --> 00:11:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is and just realizing that
happiness isn't outside of us.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:90%
And this is the big thing, Lisa.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Happiness isn't even inside us.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.770 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get
closer than that.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Outside and in is just-- I
call those body metaphors.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
We say "outside"
and "in" because we

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:90%
think we're this body.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is closer
to you than that.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not outside you.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not inside you.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:90%
It's your true nature.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The whole reason
we want to be happy

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
is because we want
to be ourselves.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we're happy,
we're being ourselves.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole reason why,
across all the cultures

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:84%
of this planet, the one thing
that we seem to have in common

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.056 align:middle line:84%
is that we want to
be happy, because we

00:12:30.056 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:90%
want to be ourselves.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's true.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that
experience of being yourself,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.315 align:middle line:84%
if you express fully who
you are, you feel free.

00:12:38.315 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a fantastic feeling.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's us being authentic.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So another thing
we look at, Lisa,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:90%
is the purpose of happiness.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, often, this gets
missed in our inquiries.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
the whole reason

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
why I didn't have any
good lectures on happiness

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
when I was studying
psychology is

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't understand
the purpose of happiness.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We just thought happiness was
a pleasurable emotion, a fun

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:90%
thing to feel from time to time.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we
had understood back

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
then the purpose of happiness,
I think we would study it more.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest that
the purpose of happiness

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:90%
is to help us to be authentic.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of
happiness is to show you

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
when you're being
true to yourself.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:84%
When you're being
true to yourself,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
even if it's putting other
people out-- temporarily,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
hopefully-- it's
like we know we're

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:84%
sustained by that feeling
of happiness, which says,

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
this is true, I'm on track,
I'm being true to myself.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of
happiness, it's a light

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:84%
on your personal dashboard,
which is basically saying,

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
you're on track,
you're doing great.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Unhappiness, on the other
hand, is often feedback

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're not being
true to ourselves.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we also have to
pay attention to unhappiness,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:84%
because it's trying to
show us, hold on a minute,

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:90%
let's take a moment.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's stop, and let's see how
I can be more true to who I am.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.084 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you been
unhappy in your life?

00:14:07.084 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, lots.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a feature of the
human condition, isn't it?

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I guess, in my experience
of unhappiness,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.480 align:middle line:84%
it originally would
have been actually

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:84%
through my relationship
with my parents,

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:84%
because my mum had experienced
depression most of her life.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So I witnessed
this person that I

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
loved dearly having this extreme
experience of depression.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was recurrent
depression, Lisa.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the depression
that happens in episodes.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
It would arrive
often unannounced.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So it would take her
and us by surprise.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:90%
And then it would settle in.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And it might settle in for
a day or a week or months.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the really
bad times, she'd

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:90%
go away into mental hospitals.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
She would have those
extreme treatments back then

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
of electric shock therapy.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, terrible, terrible,
terrible stuff going on.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So that was what I was
witnessing in my mum.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And in my dad, well,
my dad was alcoholic.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And he left home
when I was about 15.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And for the last 10
years of his life,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
he lived homeless
a lot of the time.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So the two people that
I absolutely love,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.370 align:middle line:84%
the two people that I
know really loved me,

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:90%
were battling with these demons.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I saw unhappiness
originally through them.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I have
my own unhappiness, too.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But it was right there
from the beginning.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways,
that unhappiness

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.401 align:middle line:84%
was the catalyst for
wanting me to understand

00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:90%
what happiness is.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It took your parents away
from you in many ways.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.831 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it would be
that uninvited guest that

00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:56.895 align:middle line:84%
would come in and
take away everything.

00:15:56.895 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly
what depression

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
feels like for people, is
it's the uninvited guest that

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
comes in and takes over.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.285 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:04.285 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it's disabling.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get up and
out of that with your mind?

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Can you really do that?

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Not by yourself.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't think you
can do it by yourself.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very realistic answer.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.713 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, I
don't think you can.

00:16:17.713 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I think, actually, the
purpose of healing,

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally, is to--
at the most basic level,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.449 align:middle line:84%
it's to overcome our
sense of separateness.

00:16:28.449 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:90%
That's at the most basic level.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great point.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.934 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: You take
something like depression.

00:16:32.934 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I think depression is probably
the most widespread diagnosis

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, and I would
also say the most unhelpful

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
diagnosis on the planet,
because when you really

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.687 align:middle line:84%
look at depression, it
doesn't even mean anything.

00:16:45.687 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, just
take a look at the word

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:84%
as if you've never seen
it before-- "depressed."

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.662 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:16:50.662 --> 00:16:51.995 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not even a feeling.

00:16:51.995 --> 00:16:53.605 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It means
to put down, right?

00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Well, yeah.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.614 align:middle line:84%
You have to say,
is that what it is?

00:16:57.614 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And then what I think you
have to do with depression

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
is almost go behind the
feeling or behind the word

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
and say, give me
another word for it.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is, most often,

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
people will talk about
something like, I feel down,

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.410 align:middle line:84%
or I feel isolated,
or I feel hopeless.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.384 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got
something to work with,

00:17:19.384 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
because we can deal
with those feelings.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But purely when it's depressed,
I would say it's too vague.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So we need to get more intimate
with the feeling in a way.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the word
itself is disconnecting.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.826 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, it is.

00:17:31.826 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what it is.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a really
good way of putting it,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:84%
because once it's
just depressed,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
it's almost we feel
so hopeless about it,

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.827 align:middle line:84%
it's like all we think we
can do with it is a chemical.

00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Let's try something
chemical and hope it helps.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you want to
go outside yourself, because,

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
obviously, it's not
working in here.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So when your mom was going
through that depressed state,

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
she was disconnected
from herself.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Exactly what it was.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would
say, with her, there

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
was this huge
feeling of isolation,

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.192 align:middle line:90%
a huge feeling of separateness.

00:18:03.192 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even though she
was there with somebody

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:90%
loving her so much.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Completely.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.967 align:middle line:90%
It's not a logical thing.

00:18:08.967 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, of course not.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: It's more
existential than that.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it goes to that
place of, I feel alone.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm surrounded by
everyone, and I feel alone.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And it is amazing how many
of the great traditions

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:84%
have pinpointed separateness
as the great delusion,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:84%
as the great problem of
existence, if you like.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It's something that,
fundamentally, I

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.430 align:middle line:90%
think we need to overcome.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason, you
can't heal on your own.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would say to
everybody, don't even

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:90%
try to heal on your own.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of healing is to
connect with something greater

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:84%
than your sense of
self, because it's

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.652 align:middle line:84%
something greater than
your sense of self that's

00:18:56.652 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:90%
going to get you out of this.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So purpose--

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.560 align:middle line:90%

It could be anything.

It could be your dog.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.345 align:middle line:84%
It could be-- have you ever
seen "Shirley Valentine?"

00:19:13.345 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
You ever seen that movie?
"Shirley Valentine"

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
is a story of a woman who
goes through a midlife crisis.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And she has a relationship
with her wall.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:90%
She speaks to her wall.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.115 align:middle line:90%
Hi, wall.

00:19:25.115 --> 00:19:25.948 align:middle line:90%

00:19:27.084 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Wall, literally.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking to my wall now.

00:19:31.093 --> 00:19:34.355 align:middle line:84%
Like Tom Hanks spoke

00:19:34.355 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wilson.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.688 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Wilson.

00:19:35.688 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:84%
You've got to talk to something
other than your sense of self.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It almost doesn't
matter, so long

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.712 align:middle line:84%
as you're getting out
of your self image.

00:19:43.712 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting
you use those two analogies,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.503 align:middle line:84%
that those are people
who were talking

00:19:47.503 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:84%
to inanimate objects
that can't feedback.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you were
to say your mom you loved her,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:90%
she couldn't hear you.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But she might be able to receive
more from an inanimate object--

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Possibly.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's why sometimes I
think cats and dogs really work.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, absolutely.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.619 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: I remember we
used to work on this one

00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:84%
particular ward in
the local hospital.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then,
they'd bring this parrot in.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And this parrot, I tell you,
it was not even a whole parrot,

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, its wings
were all tatty.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was more effective
than most of the consultants.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:84%
This parrot would show up,
and people became animated.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
People who hadn't
even spoken for days

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:84%
would light up and
look at this parrot.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So fundamentally,
what I've learned

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is that healing, at
the most basic level,

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:84%
is where we find
a way to overcome

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:90%
that sense of separation.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And that separation isn't just
with everyone else, ultimately.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's with
our real stuff.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And maybe we can
connect with our real self

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:84%
through a connection
with somebody else.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:01.979 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the good
news is, Lisa, we're

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
already connected
to our real self.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.239 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
possible for everyone.

00:21:07.239 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We just need reminders.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.155 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:21:09.155 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Whatever works.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what happens if
you're in a place of crisis,

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:84%
where you're going along
fine, and then an accident,

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
or you open a tax bill
you didn't expect,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
or the death of a loved
one happens instantly?

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to the
cycles of depression.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about happiness here.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the point
of the interview.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
How do you get happy from
those really devastating blows?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: OK, well, I
think, fundamentally,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.830 align:middle line:84%
what we have to do
is we have to move

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
beyond a face-off between
happiness and unhappiness,

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
because when you
create this face-off,

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.765 align:middle line:84%
it's like, all right, OK,
if I'm going to be happy,

00:21:51.765 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:90%
then I must never be unhappy.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And what we try to
do is we try to walk

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.509 align:middle line:90%
on the bright side of the road.

00:21:57.509 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And we say, I'm never going
to look at the unhappiness.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the way I'm
going to do it.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a
positive thinker.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Which is really hard
in England, by the way.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.687 align:middle line:90%
It may be easier in America.

00:22:06.687 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, I'm going
to be a positive thinker.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go on the
bright side of the road,

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.056 align:middle line:84%
and I'm never going
to be unhappy.

00:22:12.056 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:90%
That unhappiness, it haunts you.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
It haunts you in ways that,
fundamentally, it will get you.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, true happiness is
not the absence of unhappiness.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
True happiness is the capacity
to handle your unhappiness

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
honestly and fundamentally
with love and acceptance.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.059 align:middle line:84%
You have to find a way to
bring them all together.

00:22:38.059 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me,
is the great thing.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up, on
the Happiness Project,

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:84%
talking about what I
call the big happiness,

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
the big happiness that holds
you when you're flying high,

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
but also the big
happiness that holds you

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
when you're on your knees, the
big happiness that holds you

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:84%
even when everything
appears to be falling apart,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
the big happiness that helps
you to see that what's falling

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.835 align:middle line:84%
apart isn't the real you;
it's your self image.

00:23:05.835 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's bad enough, but at
least it's not the real you.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And the big
happiness, somehow, it

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
gives us that perspective to be
able to meet that unhappiness

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:84%
honestly, to not call
that unhappiness negative.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.412 align:middle line:84%
We call emotions
negative emotions.

00:23:24.412 --> 00:23:26.245 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as a negative emotion.

00:23:26.245 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:84%
There's just emotions
we judge as negative.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: But we learn
little tricks along the way.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.264 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good one.

00:23:34.264 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Well, one
of the little tricks

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I learned along the way--
and this is so simple, Lisa.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And this wouldn't help everyone.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:90%
But it helped me.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
There's an old Buddhist trick,
which is, when you're unhappy,

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:49.910 align:middle line:84%
when you're sad, when you're
angry, you don't say, I am sad,

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I am angry.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
You say, I am with
sadness, I am with anger.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might sound like
semantics to one or two people.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:84%
But to me, what that helped me
to do with my own relationship

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
with emotions was
to be able just

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:90%
to see that I'm not that anger.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:90%
That's an experience I'm having.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:90%
But it's not my identity.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it's not my
identity, maybe there's

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:84%
something bigger in me that
can meet that sadness, that

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:84%
can meet that anger and
do something about it.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a great
point, because you

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
don't identify with
it and make yourself

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.079 align:middle line:84%
that depression or that
anger or that whatever.

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it gives you--

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.536 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: It's an
experience I'm having.

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's not me.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not me,
then maybe, as I say,

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.814 align:middle line:84%
there's something else in
me that can handle this.

00:24:35.814 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
By the way, as we're
talking about this,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you a story
about Bo, my daughter Bo.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Because Bo, she's,
like, seven now.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I love
about children is

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:84%
that children can
experience all the emotions

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.125 align:middle line:90%
inside half an hour--

00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:51.708 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fully.

00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: --and still be OK.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:90%
And I love how they can do that.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
They're amazing how they can
feel every single feeling

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and just come out of
it inside half an hour

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and still be their glorious,
happy, adorable selves.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And literally, just the other
day, I was having a shower.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Bo runs up to me, and
she's all Italian.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:10%
She's all emotional.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:10%
She's having a tantrum.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:10%
And she is going for it.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And she's just having this
huge, huge experience.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I look at her,
and I hum the first few bars

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.722 align:middle line:84%
of Will Ferrell's-- sorry,
Pharrell Williams' "Happy."

00:25:35.722 --> 00:25:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.804 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: That's
all I had to do,

00:25:37.804 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:90%
the first few bars of "Happy."

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And within moments, she's gone
from tantrum to boogieing.

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And she's like that,
and she's happy.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I loved how she
could make that switch

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.910 align:middle line:90%
inside just a few seconds.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a great idea.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: And it's
like, oh my god.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I hope for you, Bo, that you
have that for your whole life,

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.940 align:middle line:84%
because that's
fundamentally what we're

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to do for
each other is just

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to see that these emotions
are big, and they're powerful,

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're real, and
they're to be honored.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But because they're not us,
there's something bigger in us

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:90%
that can handle all of those.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.471 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You said a great quote.

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
You said, "Happiness is
nowhere and right here

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.462 align:middle line:90%
at the same time."

00:26:17.462 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And that explains what you
were just telling us about

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:84%
with her, that the
happiness was nowhere,

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.870 align:middle line:84%
but then it was right
here at the same time.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah,
it's always here.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If we could
all be like that.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.198 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Happiness
is always here.

00:26:28.198 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we're
not always here.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So happiness doesn't come and
go, not the real happiness.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Joy doesn't come and go.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:90%
It's us that comes and goes.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:90%
We're the ones that get manic.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:40.220 align:middle line:90%
We're the ones that get busy.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that run
off chasing the happiness.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.314 align:middle line:84%
When we come back to ourselves,
that's when we find happiness.

00:26:47.314 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
There is a clip here
where Robert Holden

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.731 align:middle line:84%
is talking on "Good
Morning, America."

00:26:51.731 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.263 align:middle line:10%
--What if we discovered
that happiness

00:26:54.263 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:10%
was not outside our control,
but very much from within?

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:10%
What if we discovered ways,
secrets, to activate the most

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.727 align:middle line:10%
happiness that you could
have on any given day?

00:27:03.727 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's a groundbreaking
study that says it can be done.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:10%
It's called the
Happiness Project,

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:10%
a scientifically tested program
that promises, in its essence,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.791 align:middle line:10%
to rewire your
brain for happiness.

00:27:13.791 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:10%
And joining us now
is the mastermind

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:10%
behind the Happiness
Project, Dr. Robert Holden,

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:10%
author of the book "Be Happy."

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.284 align:middle line:10%
Happy to see you.

00:27:20.284 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:10%
--Good morning, Diane.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:10%
--Good to have you with us.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.943 align:middle line:10%
--Thank you for having me.

00:27:22.943 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:10%
--Now, we have been told there
are actual brain scans that

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:10%
show, over eight weeks in
this Happiness Project,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:10%
the brain changed.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.225 align:middle line:10%
The reflexive nature of the
brain changed for happiness?

00:27:34.225 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:10%
--Isn't that amazing?

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:10%
It's an eight-week program that
we've been running in the UK

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.344 align:middle line:10%
for 15 years now.

00:27:39.344 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:10%
And basically put,
we've found that when

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:10%
people take the
program, they really

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:10%
do make positive
changes in their life,

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.770 align:middle line:10%
their work, their relationships.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.200 align:middle line:10%
But also, it does change
their brain chemistry.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:10%
--And you have said, your anthem
is, you cannot chase happiness,

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.160 align:middle line:10%
but you can choose happiness.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:56.894 align:middle line:10%
--Absolutely.

00:27:56.894 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:10%
--And how does
this work, since we

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:10%
all wake up to
disappointments in our days?

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:10%
You can't get in the skirt.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.655 align:middle line:10%
You're miserable about what
you have to do that day.

00:28:06.655 --> 00:28:08.749 align:middle line:10%
You're someone facing
the economic crisis

00:28:08.749 --> 00:28:10.040 align:middle line:10%
in the worst way, unemployment.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.034 align:middle line:10%
How do you choose happiness
on a day like that?

00:28:13.034 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:10%
--Well, I think
the first thing is

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:10%
is that the pursuit of happiness
has definitely speeded up.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:10%
We are chasing happiness
faster than we've ever

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:10%
chased it before.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:10%
We work faster, we live faster,
we eat faster, we talk faster,

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:10%
we breathe faster, we
do everything faster.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:10%
And yet, in this race
towards happiness,

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:10%
we somehow haven't
closed the gap.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:10%
So I think we do need to stop
and really rethink happiness

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:10%
and ask ourselves,
truly, what is happiness?

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's so important,
because your definition

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:10%
of happiness
ultimately influences

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:10%
the rest of your life.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.044 align:middle line:10%
So start by getting clear
on what happiness is.

00:28:46.044 --> 00:28:46.710 align:middle line:10%
--Getting clear.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.190 align:middle line:10%
And I am going to run
through the five areas

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.092 align:middle line:10%
very quickly here.

00:28:50.092 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:10%
And then we'll talk in
detail about some of it.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:10%
But attitude-- make up your
mind that you want to be happy.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:10%
Relationships-- you focus, and
focus your essential energy

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.320 align:middle line:10%
on your loved ones.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:10%
Work-- have a passion, not
a job; a purpose, not work.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:10%
Faith-- believe in
something bigger.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:10%
And participate--
don't wait, just do it.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:10%
But I want to bring up a
couple of our audience members

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:10%
if I can-- Penelope,
Bobby, and Felicia,

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:10%
because we gave some
happiness tests.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:17.870 align:middle line:10%
--Yeah.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.811 align:middle line:10%
We made sure America just tested
themselves on happiness today.

00:29:20.811 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:10%
--Right.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:10%
And Penelope-- raise
your hand over there,

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:10%
Penelope-- you got the
hurry-up problem, I gather.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:10%
Tell me what you would say to
Penelope about getting happy

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:10%
when she rushes, rushes,
rushes through life.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:10%
How does she begin?

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.514 align:middle line:10%
--Well, Penelope, we
had a conversation.

00:29:36.514 --> 00:29:38.180 align:middle line:10%
And we worked out
that, sometimes, we're

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:10%
in such a rush, it's almost like
we have no time to be happy.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:10%
How strange is that?

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:10%
It's like we suffer from what
I call destination addiction.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.020 align:middle line:10%
We hope to be happy one day.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.990 align:middle line:10%
But really, the art
to happiness is also

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:10%
to make time to be happy now.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.200 align:middle line:10%
So the key today is to
stop once in a while.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.924 align:middle line:10%
Pay attention to the moments in
your day when you're happiest.

00:29:58.924 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:10%
And see if you can
learn something

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:10%
about yourself and your life
by tuning into those moments.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:10%
--So start.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.620 align:middle line:10%
It's a simple little
habit to develop

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:10%
by savoring, stopping to savor.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:10%
--Yeah, and definitely
stop every now and then.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:10%
--Bobby-- overwhelmed, just
over-scheduled, overwhelmed.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:10%
What's the answer?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.810 align:middle line:10%
--Well, I think, from a
conversation with Bobby,

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:10%
what we worked out
is you really have

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:10%
to work out why
you wake up today.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's a
really good question--

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:10%
why have I woken up today?

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.949 align:middle line:10%
What purpose shall I give today?

00:30:30.949 --> 00:30:33.240 align:middle line:10%
And in working out what
purpose you want to give a day,

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:10%
I think life becomes a creative
act, because now you're

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:10%
not just waiting to
be happy, but you're

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:10%
participating in your life.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.060 align:middle line:10%
You're saying, I can
create my day, too.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:10%
Even though the stock
market goes up and down,

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.807 align:middle line:10%
I can have a say in how my
life is going to be today.

00:30:46.807 --> 00:30:48.390 align:middle line:10%
--Do you believe you
can do it, Bobby?

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:49.640 align:middle line:10%
--Oh, absolutely.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:50.670 align:middle line:10%
--All right.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.430 align:middle line:10%
New way to think.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:10%
And of all the tests we gave,
Felicia is the happiest.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to our happiness
champion over there.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.890 align:middle line:10%
And why is that?

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.020 align:middle line:10%
--Well, firstly, if you
take a look at Felicia,

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:10%
I think you are just
joy, if I may say so.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:10%
You've got this smile,
and it's gorgeous.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:10%
But you have said two things
to me that are so important.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:10%
The first is that you
have a strong faith.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.130 align:middle line:10%
And that is absolutely
a stand out clause.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.240 align:middle line:10%
If you believe in a god
of unconditional love,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.549 align:middle line:10%
that supports you in
your life, no end.

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:10%
But the other thing
that Felicia has,

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:10%
she pays attention
to her relationships.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:10%
She gives her best energy to her
most important relationships.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.790 align:middle line:10%
And undoubtedly,
that's important,

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.817 align:middle line:10%
because we've been shopping
for happiness for a long time.

00:31:32.817 --> 00:31:35.400 align:middle line:10%
And I don't think we're going
to find it in the shopping list.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.450 align:middle line:10%
We'll find it in our
relationships and our faith.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.450 align:middle line:10%
--Yes, and a couple of
other things you've said-

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:42.550 align:middle line:10%
take a vow of kindness
starting with yourself.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.490 align:middle line:10%
And mothers particularly
have to do that.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:10%
Be kind to yourself.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:10%
And remember, happiness
is contagious.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:10%
So all around you,
Felicia, people

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:10%
are inexplicably
happy this morning.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:10%
And we thank you so much, Dr.--

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.143 align:middle line:10%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:54.143 --> 00:31:56.260 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So you said
that happiness literally

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.857 align:middle line:10%
influences every decision
you make in your life.

00:31:58.857 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Your
definition of happiness

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.870 align:middle line:84%
influences every
decision in your life,

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.800 align:middle line:84%
because, for instance, if you
place happiness outside of you,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Your whole focus is
on outside of you.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.920 align:middle line:84%
If you know it's
inside of you, you're

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.794 align:middle line:84%
going to make decisions
in a whole other way.

00:32:12.794 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:84%
If you know it's
you, you're going

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.542 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions in the
whole, whole other way.

00:32:16.542 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do we know what
our definition of happiness is?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.785 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
that individually?

00:32:20.785 --> 00:32:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: We have to
spend some time on that.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:90%
We really do.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to actually
ask ourselves.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:90%
It becomes an inquiry.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to actually really
get to grips with that

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and actually think about
that for ourselves.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, really,
I'm a teacher of inquiry.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I love inquiry, because
inquiry basically

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.500 align:middle line:90%
respects the individual.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It respects you and me.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Inquiry is based on the
idea that, really, we

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.850 align:middle line:84%
have the wisdom
within us already.

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is never really new.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is remembered.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.770 align:middle line:84%
You and I, we know
what true happiness is.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:84%
When we stop being neurotic
and running around and being

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.130 align:middle line:84%
manic and busy, we
come back to our heart.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And our heart knows
what happiness is.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we remember, then
we set the record straight.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was having a
horrible day the other day.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.450 align:middle line:84%
There were several
things that went wrong.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Somebody lost a
huge chunk of money.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And then something
else happened.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.599 align:middle line:90%
It was just like a cascade.

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my husband
halfway through the day,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, I feel like
I am in this loop,

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:28.031 align:middle line:84%
that I'm in this cycle of
catastrophe-- crisis, crisis,

00:33:28.031 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:90%
crisis.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm waiting for
the next crisis,

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.800 align:middle line:90%
because I'm defending it.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And so then I get my
daughter in the car.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.350 align:middle line:84%
We go to her practice,
and I realize

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that I've completely
missed the practice.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It was at a totally
different time.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I look at the text, and it was
in a different place and time

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.542 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:33:46.542 --> 00:33:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there
with her and went,

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.740 align:middle line:84%
all right, I need to make
a decision right here.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm either going to let her
feel the entire impact of my day

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and everything wrong that has
happened up to this point.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Or what I chose to do instead
is I rolled my windows down.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful, breezy day.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
We laid the seat
backs of the car.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:90%
We opened the sun roof.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.179 align:middle line:90%
And we watched this oak tree.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is burned as an
image in my mind right now

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle line:90%
of just blowing in the wind.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.500 align:middle line:90%
We turned the music up.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:90%
That song "Happiness" was on.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And we just cranked it
up and sat there and just

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.319 align:middle line:90%
had a great time.

00:34:20.319 --> 00:34:21.151 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Beautiful.

00:34:21.151 --> 00:34:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And then we fell asleep.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Wow, really?

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We took a 20-minute
cat nap in the sun--

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: How cool.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.014 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:34:27.014 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --during
the hour practice.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:31.330 align:middle line:90%
It was such a golden moment.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I chose to do after
that was not talk about my day,

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:84%
not recreate it, not
tell the story of it,

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:40.989 align:middle line:84%
not get back into
the cycle of it,

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.679 align:middle line:90%
because it was only going to--

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:84%
So then I thought, how much
do we do that in our life?

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:84%
How much do we recreate
the childhood trauma,

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:84%
the bad relationship,
the horrible boss?

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:84%
How do we recreate that every
single moment when we talk

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:90%
about it or think about it?

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're teaching when
we talk to our kids about that,

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:84%
is to how to have a
horrible day, a bad boss,

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.160 align:middle line:90%
and really lose a lot of money.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.980 align:middle line:90%
It's really kind of what we do.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So that goes back
to the definition.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: It does.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say, what I
love about what you've just

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.386 align:middle line:84%
told me there,
though, as well, is

00:35:09.386 --> 00:35:13.105 align:middle line:84%
that you know enough
about happiness already

00:35:13.105 --> 00:35:15.120 align:middle line:84%
that one of the
gifts of happiness

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:84%
is that it gives you
the power to reset

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.955 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the unhappiness.

00:35:20.955 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's taken a
lot of practice, though.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.455 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, but
that's what happens

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:84%
is the more and more familiar
we get with real happiness,

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:84%
it's like we notice when
we're out of balance.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And initially, we maybe
can't do very much about it.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's that reset
muscle in us, which actually,

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:84%
at some point, says,
hold on a minute.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Stop telling the story.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Stop chasing whatever I'm
chasing, whatever it is.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
beautiful example for me

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
of what we can do when we
know what true happiness is.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We get that reset
capacity in us to do it.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I was raised
by a raging alcoholic.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.670 align:middle line:90%
God bless him.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Vietnam vet and had
post traumatic stress

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and raging fits.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Things would go flying
into television sets,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and wooden spoons would
get cracked on a lot of us.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
reactive childhood.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I would always look
for underneath the bed.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And I had to un-train that
level of reaction in me.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And those types of cycles
go through generations.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Studies show they go through
up to five generations

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:31.090 align:middle line:84%
deep of abuse, rage,
alcoholism, all of that.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Knowing what I have
been so blessed

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to interview
people like you,

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:84%
read your books, throughout
my wonderful experiences,

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.572 align:middle line:90%
is that you can break cycles.

00:36:42.572 --> 00:36:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: That's right.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wrote "Happiness
Now." "Happiness Now," that

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:90%
was a book I wrote back in '98.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.540 align:middle line:84%
That was the one Oprah found
and why I went on her show.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:84%
"Happiness Now" was
making that stand

00:36:55.830 --> 00:37:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to say that sometimes
happiness is giving up

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:90%
all hopes for a better past.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It's that moment
when we basically

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:84%
are able to look at our
past and, instead of saying

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves, if only
it had been different,

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I would be different now, it's
actually being able to say,

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:84%
do you know what, my
past happened exactly

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.330 align:middle line:84%
as it happened, and
it's time to honor that.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And if I can honor that, then
maybe I can actually let it go,

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
let it be in the
past, a place that I

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:90%
can revisit whenever I want.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to live
now in this moment.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:90%
That process is sacred.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Normally, it's a
process described

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
as forgiveness
and of letting go.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.892 align:middle line:90%
And it's vital to happiness.

00:37:43.892 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely vital.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.039 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I completely
can see that.

00:37:47.039 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And parenting has been
one of the best ways

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.570 align:middle line:84%
for me to learn that,
because I didn't

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.370 align:middle line:90%
want to repeat the patterns.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to create
something new.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And it gives me the opportunity
every moment to do that.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Oprah would've been a great mom.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And she is the
mother to many, where

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
she gets to teach
what she learns.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, I completely
forgive my father.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my god.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:19.220 align:middle line:84%
What he saw and what he
experienced in that war,

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing that he's still
such an incredible human being.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:90%
So it does enable that.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And so this is what you do.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
Happiness Project.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
one, which I find incredible,

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:35.154 align:middle line:90%
about the Success Intelligence.

00:38:35.154 --> 00:38:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little bit
earlier about that link

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.870 align:middle line:90%
between happiness and success.

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:41.134 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yes.

00:38:41.134 --> 00:38:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell you
about the personal link.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the personal
link, really, for me,

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is that I described
the Happiness Project

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.030 align:middle line:90%
as my open letter to my mum.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think of Success
Intelligence as my open letter

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.970 align:middle line:90%
to my dad.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: And the
Happiness Project

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.270 align:middle line:84%
is a meditation on
what is real happiness.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And Success Intelligence
is a meditation

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.190 align:middle line:90%
on what is real success.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is real success?

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.980 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:07.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking you.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: OK.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:13.573 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, I would
have to say it's love.

00:39:13.573 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:84%
If your definition of success
has little or no mention

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of love, get another
definition as fast as possible.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.851 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: It has to be love.

00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is it you hear
mostly, definition of success?

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.675 align:middle line:90%
Having X, Y, Z?

00:39:30.675 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.090 align:middle line:84%
It goes along the same
lines as happiness.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.755 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
having and getting

00:39:36.755 --> 00:39:38.660 align:middle line:90%
and wanting and chasing.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And everybody goes down
that line for a while,

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.300 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
we satisfy ourselves

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.490 align:middle line:90%
that it isn't real success.

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like a phase we
have to go through.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.045 align:middle line:90%
And we do it.

00:39:50.045 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've done it.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, we all do it.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:90%
And I encourage people to do it.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Get it over and done with.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.070 align:middle line:90%
That's my feeling.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The acquiring,
having thing.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah, go
and get your BMW.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Do what you need to do.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.019 align:middle line:84%
And enjoy it, as
well, by the way.

00:40:03.019 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not that these
things are wrong.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
don't make you happy.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the keys to
happiness is to understand

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:90%
that nothing makes you happy.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.350 align:middle line:84%
If you can get that,
then you're free.

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in this
world makes us happy.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything in this world can
encourage us to be happy.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:90%
But nothing can make us happy.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Once you've got
that, once you know

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that you've arrived with
the happiness already,

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.420 align:middle line:84%
then you're free
to enjoy the world.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Now you can go shopping for fun
rather than thinking shopping

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.410 align:middle line:90%
is the purpose of your life.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Window shopping
is just as satisfying

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.970 align:middle line:90%
when you realize that.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: You can shop for fun.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's just not the
purpose of your life.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And once you know that,
that's really cool.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.220 align:middle line:84%
In the same way,
with success, it's

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:56.120 align:middle line:84%
like you have to go through
some of the counterfeit coins

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.052 align:middle line:90%
to get to the real gold.

00:40:58.052 --> 00:41:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just said
something really, really great.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.730 align:middle line:84%
You said, as long
as we don't realize

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that outside things
make us happy,

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:10.360 align:middle line:84%
but you've already
arrived with happiness.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Detail that for me.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.610 align:middle line:90%
You arrive with happiness.

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Arrive where?

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Here?

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:16.274 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Here.

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely here.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Something happens to us, Lisa.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And it happens in different
ways to all of us.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But we experience
a fall from grace.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:84%
The fall from grace is
where, for some reason,

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.690 align:middle line:84%
we lose touch with our
true nature, what I call--

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Happens around our 20s.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.640 align:middle line:90%
20s, 30s.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.684 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:41:39.684 --> 00:41:41.100 align:middle line:84%
It's where we lose
touch with what

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:90%
I call the unconditioned self.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, the unconditioned self
is just our true nature.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And really, happiness
is our true nature.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is you
minus your neurosis.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.480 align:middle line:90%
That's all happiness is.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.896 align:middle line:90%
It's just you.

00:41:56.896 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Love is you minus your neurosis.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything you need for success,
you arrived with that already.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.920 align:middle line:90%
It's in your being.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is, in our
world, we don't do being.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.787 align:middle line:84%
We do doing, going, wanting,
having, learning, helping,

00:42:13.787 --> 00:42:15.620 align:middle line:84%
chasing-- bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're marketed to do.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yes.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're marketed
to this prescription will

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.404 align:middle line:84%
make you feel this way
and romantic and all that.

00:42:23.404 --> 00:42:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: In the cultures
that you and I grew up in,

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:26.910 align:middle line:90%
we're not beings.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:28.560 align:middle line:90%
We're consumers.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Magazines,
articles, billboards--

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.450 align:middle line:90%
you see them all day, every day.

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.715 align:middle line:84%
How many-- 3,000 images--
are given to you a day

00:42:34.715 --> 00:42:35.340 align:middle line:90%
of what to buy?

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Exactly.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:35.900 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.691 align:middle line:90%
That's the average.

00:42:36.691 --> 00:42:39.535 align:middle line:84%
And if you live in a
city, it's 3,000-plus.

00:42:39.535 --> 00:42:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Unless you're
in Colorado here,

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.534 align:middle line:84%
where they don't
have billboards.

00:42:42.534 --> 00:42:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you have that
idea of everywhere

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.270 align:middle line:84%
you look is being told, you
need to do this to be happy,

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:84%
you need to buy
this to be happy,

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.480 align:middle line:84%
you need to go this
place to be happy.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Every external message
out there tells you

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.730 align:middle line:90%
happiness is outside yourself.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: It's absolutely right.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book called "Shift
Happens." "Shift Happens"

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.340 align:middle line:84%
is a book where I
made a distinction

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.950 align:middle line:84%
between self-improvement
and self-acceptance.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And in that book,
I made the point

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.570 align:middle line:84%
that, actually, no amount
of self-improvement

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:17.370 align:middle line:84%
can make up for any
lack of self-acceptance.

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Self-acceptance is
where you accept

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that you are the happiness
you're looking for,

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:84%
that you are the love
you're looking for.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.180 align:middle line:84%
If you won't accept
that, then it

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.394 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter how much you
try to improve yourself.

00:43:30.394 --> 00:43:32.935 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how beautiful
you try to make yourself look

00:43:32.935 --> 00:43:35.580 align:middle line:84%
or how successful you try
to make yourself look.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:84%
You'll never feel like you've
improved yourself enough.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.163 align:middle line:84%
This is why self-improvement
is so exhausting for all of us.

00:43:42.163 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.010 align:middle line:90%
It's such a pursuit.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: It's such a pursuit.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.440 align:middle line:84%
What we're telling ourselves
is, I'm not ready for happiness

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.140 align:middle line:84%
yet, I'm not ready for love yet,
I'm not ready for success yet.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.306 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm not good enough.

00:43:52.306 --> 00:43:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: I'll be ready
for it soon, apparently,

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:90%
in about 18 months' time.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But that 18 months
never gets any closer.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And our whole life,
we're chasing,

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to
improve ourselves in order

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:07.274 align:middle line:84%
to be happier, to be
successful, to be more loving.

00:44:07.274 --> 00:44:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
greatest things

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.600 align:middle line:84%
we can do for
ourselves is to just

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:15.780 align:middle line:84%
be willing, just for a moment,
to see what's it like to be me

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:84%
when I'm not trying
to improve myself.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Literally, what's
it like to be me

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.720 align:middle line:84%
when I'm not trying
to improve myself?

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, when people
sit with that for five minutes,

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:28.470 align:middle line:84%
they start to feel really
good about themselves.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: And what
they're connecting with

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.230 align:middle line:84%
is the joy that we're
meant to follow,

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:36.525 align:middle line:84%
the love that's trying to guide
us and bless us and inspire us

00:44:36.525 --> 00:44:37.070 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:37.780 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.380 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I love that
you give us practical ways

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.050 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get to that place.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.400 align:middle line:90%
I love the idea of "Holy Shift."

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.490 align:middle line:90%
This is-- explain it if you can.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the "Course in
Miracles" brought to you

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.210 align:middle line:90%
in easy, digestible chunks.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yay, "Holy Shift."

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.145 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been a student
of "A Course in Miracles"

00:44:54.145 --> 00:44:55.390 align:middle line:90%
for 20 years.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And "A Course in Miracles"
is a publishing phenomenon,

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:01.100 align:middle line:84%
because it has sold
millions of copies,

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.270 align:middle line:90%
but hardly anybody's read it.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
hardly anybody's read it

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:08.185 align:middle line:84%
is because it's, like,
1,500 pages of full-on text.

00:45:08.185 --> 00:45:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, it's
difficult to digest.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: It's so hard.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.320 align:middle line:90%
It is so hard.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Most of us, we put it
on our bookshelves,

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and we just let
the glow help us.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And we want to read
it, and we can't.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:21.140 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.756 align:middle line:90%
We go to Marianne Williamson.

00:45:22.756 --> 00:45:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Thank the lord for
Marianne Williamson.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.080 align:middle line:90%
We read "A Return to Love."

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And we find other people
have written beautiful books

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.180 align:middle line:90%
about "A Course in Miracles."

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to do
with "Holy Shift"

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:84%
was to create a day book of
excerpts from the course.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is purely
"Course in Miracles"

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.860 align:middle line:90%
material and excerpted.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So I've taken 365 of
my favorite sayings,

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and I've put them
into a day book.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can just
open it up and--

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just like I am now.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Yeah.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.128 align:middle line:84%
And you'll hopefully
find something

00:45:52.128 --> 00:45:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that really resonates
and just make sense.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you say, "You
believe that without the ego,

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.250 align:middle line:90%
all would be chaos.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I assure you that without
the ego, all would be love."

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And you take one of
these daily quotes

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.624 align:middle line:84%
and just approach your entire
day with that philosophy.

00:46:10.624 --> 00:46:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: That's a
beautiful meditation.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So can you read that
one to me again?

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: "You believe
that without the ego,

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:17.950 align:middle line:90%
all would be chaos.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:22.015 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I assure you that without
the ego, all would be love."

00:46:22.015 --> 00:46:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: OK, so if we just took
a moment and said, OK, hold on.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:28.806 align:middle line:84%
What if, today, instead of
what does the ego love to do,

00:46:28.806 --> 00:46:29.680 align:middle line:90%
let's think about it.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.250 align:middle line:90%
The ego loves to judge.

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm always judging myself.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.400 align:middle line:84%
All right, just
for five minutes,

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see what
it's like to be me

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.845 align:middle line:90%
when I'm not judging myself.

00:46:38.845 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give up
judgment for five minutes.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.750 align:middle line:90%
It should be OK.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything will be fine.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.510 align:middle line:90%
It won't be that chaotic.

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:46.720 align:middle line:90%
And I just sit for a moment.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.450 align:middle line:90%
And I just go, hold on a minute.

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.036 align:middle line:84%
This is me when I'm
not judging myself.

00:46:51.036 --> 00:46:52.540 align:middle line:90%
This feels good.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.580 align:middle line:90%
This feels really, really good.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, I've been judging
myself my whole life.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Where's it got me?

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's think about
this for a minute.

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, seriously, how well
have I done by judging myself?

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And it occurs to me that,
well, actually, it's not really

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.520 align:middle line:90%
been that good for me.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I can't honestly say to you
that the success of my life

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:16.440 align:middle line:84%
is down to the fact that I've
judged myself consistently,

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.716 align:middle line:90%
24/7, for 30 years.

00:47:19.716 --> 00:47:21.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
types of meditations

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.370 align:middle line:90%
are asking us to do.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:23.832 align:middle line:90%
They're asking is just to stop.

00:47:23.832 --> 00:47:25.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing
in a spiritual practice.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Stop telling your story.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Stop being an ego.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Stop being your self-image.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And let's just see what it's
like to be you when you're not

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:35.900 align:middle line:84%
chasing the happiness, when
you're not searching for love,

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.190 align:middle line:90%
when you're not after success.

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's just see what it's
like to be you already,

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:42.740 align:middle line:90%
before you go shopping.

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, maybe, what
you're shopping

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:46.830 align:middle line:90%
for is what you already are.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can
apply that to eating,

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.300 align:middle line:90%
as well, emotional eating.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.380 align:middle line:84%
You can really stop
judging yourself

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.640 align:middle line:84%
about what you
look like and then

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.130 align:middle line:84%
be mindful in what you're
putting in your mouth

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:00.370 align:middle line:90%
and in what reason.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Is this because I'm
trying to create comfort

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:03.850 align:middle line:90%
in a difficult situation?

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.064 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe I should
look at the situation.

00:48:06.064 --> 00:48:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Those types of things.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Totally.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.086 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you did this really
great piece on leadership.

00:48:11.086 --> 00:48:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
everything we've

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.610 align:middle line:84%
talked about up to this
point, about happiness

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and about Success Intelligence,
the next evolution of that

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:22.045 align:middle line:90%
is leadership, I believe.

00:48:22.045 --> 00:48:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: I agree with you.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going to
take a quick look at this,

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.599 align:middle line:84%
because I think
it's very important.

00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:29.035 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at Robert Holden
talking about leadership.

00:48:29.035 --> 00:48:29.490 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:30.970 align:middle line:84%
--My starting point
with leadership

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.110 align:middle line:84%
is that leadership
isn't a position.

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not a job title.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not a pay grade.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more a way of
showing up in the world.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And leadership
starts with the idea

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that, really, the
world is an effect.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.725 align:middle line:90%
It's an effect of us.

00:48:45.725 --> 00:48:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to see
a different world,

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.530 align:middle line:84%
we just have to be willing
to show up differently.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the four areas
that I've covered,

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:54.990 align:middle line:84%
the first one was all
about that leadership

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.410 align:middle line:84%
is about being more
of who you really are.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.545 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just about
putting on a suit

00:48:59.545 --> 00:49:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and showing up in a certain
role and being a certain way.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It's actually being more
of who you really are.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:08.610 align:middle line:84%
If you think something
is missing at work,

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:10.830 align:middle line:84%
if you think something
is missing in a project,

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.140 align:middle line:84%
if you think something is
missing in a conversation,

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:17.290 align:middle line:84%
maybe what's missing is
you, more of the real you.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:19.380 align:middle line:90%
So that's my starting point.

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.470 align:middle line:84%
After that, I'm
suggesting that leadership

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:26.310 align:middle line:84%
is all about making sure the
team understands what's real,

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:28.550 align:middle line:84%
that we know what our
real strengths are,

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:31.210 align:middle line:84%
our real purpose are, and
what our real vision is.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:34.645 align:middle line:84%
We will be busy, we will be
manic, we will be hyperactive.

00:49:34.645 --> 00:49:37.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll get a lot of
stuff done every day.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But our ultimate
goal as a leader

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.710 align:middle line:84%
is to make sure that the team
knows what real success is.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.010 align:middle line:90%
So that'll be point number two.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Point three is
all about the idea

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that the principle is this--
if you're alive, you need help.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So as a leader, you
must be willing not

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:54.400 align:middle line:90%
to do it all on your own.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be willing
to try to allow yourself

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.350 align:middle line:84%
to be receptive and to be
open to support, as well.

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:01.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's a really big key.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And the goal, really,
here is the idea

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that, ultimately, none of us
are smarter than all of us.

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:10.060 align:middle line:90%
So let's get everybody thinking.

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, in
leadership, the key

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.920 align:middle line:84%
is not to do it
always by yourself.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.170 align:middle line:84%
There is such a thing as the
loneliness of the leader.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But often, that loneliness
is self-imposed.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't need to be.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:21.743 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:50:21.743 --> 00:50:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In that clip, you
talked about leadership.

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And what does that
have to do with love?

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:29.970 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about happiness.

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:31.434 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about success.

00:50:31.434 --> 00:50:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Now we've talked
about leadership.

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:35.040 align:middle line:84%
How does that lead into
the "Loveability" course?

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: OK, well, on this
planet, every act of love

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:42.120 align:middle line:90%
is an act of leadership.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally, the highest
note of leadership--

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:49.870 align:middle line:84%
when you look at our
planet, deep down, we all

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:51.790 align:middle line:90%
know we're made of love.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:54.710 align:middle line:84%
We all know love
is super important.

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:57.090 align:middle line:84%
We would all vote
for love in a moment.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:59.950 align:middle line:84%
We look around the planet,
and what do we see?

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We're fundamentally seeing
fear, pain, suffering, war.

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
something's missing here.

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.280 align:middle line:90%
What's missing?

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Us.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.260 align:middle line:90%
We're missing.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.807 align:middle line:84%
How can we get more involved
in the world and in life?

00:51:13.807 --> 00:51:14.890 align:middle line:90%
We've got to show up more.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:16.090 align:middle line:90%
How do we show up more?

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:20.390 align:middle line:84%
We show up as the loving men
and women that we really are.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:22.970 align:middle line:84%
When we truly choose
love and we make

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:26.090 align:middle line:84%
love more important than
anything else, that's you

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and me, Lisa, showing
up as our true selves.

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's leadership.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Who does it affect?

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It affects the person in
front of you right now.

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:38.230 align:middle line:84%
It affects your family, and
it affects your workplace.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It affects everybody.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Love on this planet
is leadership.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Take leaders
like Nelson Mandela,

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama.

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.915 align:middle line:84%
Those are leaders
that lead with love.

00:51:49.915 --> 00:51:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Completely.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the
practical part of it?

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:55.330 align:middle line:84%
What does the course
teach on this?

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLDEN: So "Loveability"
is a three-day program

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.280 align:middle line:84%
that I created because I
didn't have a class on love

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.370 align:middle line:90%
when I was at school.

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:06.210 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't there.

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:09.430 align:middle line:84%
The closest we got was
"Romeo and Juliet."

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:10.480 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good story
with a terrible ending.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's not great.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.830 align:middle line:84%
When I studied psychology, we
had one lecture on love-- well,

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:23.685 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
really was about love.

00:52:23.685 --> 00:52:26.330 align:middle line:84%
The lecture was called
"Interpersonal Attraction

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Theory."

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I remember asking my lecturers,
I said, is this love?

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.885 align:middle line:90%
And they were so noncommittal.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And I messed with them.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.422 align:middle line:84%
At Christmas, I sent
them Christmas cards.

00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I signed them "with lots of
interpersonal attraction,

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:43.900 align:middle line:90%
from Robert Holden."

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So in psychology, we didn't
even talk about love.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And I felt there
was an absence here.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Even in philosophy,
some of my heroes

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.800 align:middle line:90%
would not talk about love.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Carl Jung.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung talked about
everything, including UFOs.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.710 align:middle line:90%
He did not talk about love.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Krishnamurti, one of my heroes,
would not talk about love.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Carl Rogers, he talked about
unconditional positive regard.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.100 align:middle line:90%
But he wouldn't talk about love.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.050 align:middle line:84%
The reason why so many of these
people wouldn't talk about love

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:17.570 align:middle line:84%
is because they felt that too
many people had got to the word

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:21.640 align:middle line:84%
first, and that it
was tainted somehow.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.210 align:middle line:84%
There was too much
confusion in the word.

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you know,
Lisa, I believe

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.910 align:middle line:90%
that clarity is the way forward.

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So I feel it's like, let's
not be afraid of these words.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's get back to them and
find some clarity in there.

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So with "Loveability,"
that's my meditation on love.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.360 align:middle line:84%
That's where I'm saying, let's
get clear about what love is.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And let's start very,
very clearly with the idea

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:48.020 align:middle line:90%
that love is not just a word.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Just in the same way that you
and I are not just bodies,

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.480 align:middle line:84%
it's like we're more than
that, love is not just a word.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's get past the word.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we get past
the word, I think

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.260 align:middle line:84%
what we come to is,
fundamentally, a basic drama.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The basic drama is that
our unconditioned self

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.050 align:middle line:90%
knows it's loveable.

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And the basic truth of
the unconditioned self

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.720 align:middle line:90%
is I am loveable.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have this unconditioned
self, but we move away from it.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:22.330 align:middle line:84%
We have that loss of being that
we were talking about earlier.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And as we move away from
the unconditioned self,

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:26.660 align:middle line:90%
we create a self-image.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.390 align:middle line:90%
We create a persona.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the unconditioned
self believes in love.

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:32.980 align:middle line:90%
It knows it is loveable.

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.480 align:middle line:84%
The basic truth
is I am loveable.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.800 align:middle line:90%
The self image has a basic fear.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The basic fear is
I'm not loveable.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.460 align:middle line:84%
From that basic fear comes
our myth of inadequacy.

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.600 align:middle line:84%
The myth of inadequacy
is I'm not enough.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I fear I'm not
lovable, I now tell myself

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not beautiful enough,
I'm not smart enough,

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interesting enough,
I'm not powerful enough.

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.540 align:middle line:84%
That's where the myth of
inadequacy comes from.

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It comes to that fear
that I'm not lovable.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, if we can
tackle that, if we

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:08.990 align:middle line:10%
can meet that fear face-to-face
and know that it's just a fear,

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:11.219 align:middle line:10%
that brings us
back to ourselves.

00:55:11.219 --> 00:55:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And in "Loveability,"
what I'm trying

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.440 align:middle line:10%
to do is I'm trying to help
people to see that the way

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:21.720 align:middle line:10%
to find love is to be the
most loving person you can be.

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The way to love one
person on this planet

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.660 align:middle line:84%
is to be willing to love
everybody on this planet.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:33.704 align:middle line:84%
The way to show up fully in
your life is just to-- Rumi

00:55:33.704 --> 00:55:34.370 align:middle line:90%
said it so well.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:36.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, "To be a
true human being,

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.610 align:middle line:90%
gamble everything on love."

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's just test how
good love really is.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's get past the
word and past the idea

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:47.940 align:middle line:90%
that it's just a feeling.

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into
what it really is.

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:54.030 align:middle line:84%
My daughter, Bo, I was talking
with her about love one day.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her what love is.

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Actually, no-- the
actual conversation

00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:03.850 align:middle line:84%
was we were looking at what
we are, what we are made of.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:06.320 align:middle line:84%
She was eavesdropping,
actually, on a conversation

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.700 align:middle line:90%
that Holly and I were having.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I'd been telling Holly that
I was doing this meditation

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.440 align:middle line:90%
on, what are we made of, really?

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.300 align:middle line:90%
What are we made of?

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And Bo, my daughter,
heard this conversation.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And she just said,
Daddy, it's easy.

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what
we're made of.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, Bo, tell me.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:26.010 align:middle line:84%
She said, we're made
of love and water.

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, how cute.

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: Love and water.

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:28.960 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I just thought,
I'll go with that.

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:31.900 align:middle line:90%
I'll go with that.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what we're
made of, love and water.

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.720 align:middle line:90%
The soul is made of love.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.630 align:middle line:90%
That's our true nature.

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:middle line:84%
When we remember
that and when we

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:43.840 align:middle line:84%
know that love is intelligent--
this is the key bit, Lisa--

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.850 align:middle line:84%
when we know love
is intelligent,

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:49.020 align:middle line:84%
then we can go to love,
which is our true nature,

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and we can say to love,
show me how to live today.

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Show me how to be the person
I most want to be in the world

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:55.970 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:56.950 align:middle line:90%
You guide me.

00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:59.460 align:middle line:84%
You inspire me how
to work in the way I

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.910 align:middle line:84%
want to work, relate in
the way I want to relate,

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:03.480 align:middle line:90%
and be the person I want to be.

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.260 align:middle line:84%
If we do that, that, I believe,
is what helps us to be happy.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what helps
us to be successful.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:12.787 align:middle line:84%
That brings the three
projects together.

00:57:12.787 --> 00:57:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is beautiful.

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I love that-- love intelligence.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.209 align:middle line:84%
It is something that is really
intelligent if you let it be.

00:57:18.209 --> 00:57:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: It's completely true.

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.140 align:middle line:84%
When you stop letting love
be a word or a feeling

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.435 align:middle line:84%
and you know it's our
true consciousness,

00:57:24.435 --> 00:57:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that's when we know that
love is intelligent.

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's complete knowing.

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for
bringing all this together

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:34.024 align:middle line:84%
to have a conversation about
happiness, success, and love--

00:57:34.024 --> 00:57:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: We did well.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --all in
the same context.

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.906 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLDEN: We did well.

00:57:36.906 --> 00:57:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.426 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you would like to watch
