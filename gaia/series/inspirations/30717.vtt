00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.650 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to our beautiful,
Los Angeles studio.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:10%
So you might recognize the
laugh [LAUGHING] of my guest

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:10%
today, because spiritual teacher
Michael Tamura has joined me

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:10%
before on "Gaiam
Inspirations," telling

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:10%
his extraordinary story.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And so many people were
interested in his story.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We really didn't
get to all of it.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to have
him back on the show

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.590 align:middle line:84%
to continue with his incredible
journey of dying five times.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So he has been a spiritual
teacher for over 39 years.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And he has returned here
on "Gaiam Inspirations"

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.854 align:middle line:84%
to share messages
from the other side.

00:00:56.854 --> 00:00:58.662 align:middle line:90%
[MAKING EERIE SOUNDS]

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:84%
It sounds so it weird, but
this actually happened to you.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:84%
And as I said before,
it's amazing that you're

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:90%
here to tell these stories.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Yes I'm amazed too.
LISA GARR: Yes.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:10%
Not many people have really
been clinically dead five times

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:10%
and could sit here
and laugh about it.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a gift to
just have you here.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So for those who didn't
see the other interview,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
you are a teacher,
and you've been

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.730 align:middle line:84%
teaching messages
of spirituality

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:90%
for the past 39 years.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
What is the essence
of what you teach?

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:10%
Well, like I mentioned
before, I've always taught

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:10%
people how to die correctly.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:10%
But that's something
that most people

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:10%
have a hard time hearing.
LISA GARR: Right.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I guess people don't
want to hear about dying.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn how to
live before I go die.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's like, hi,
good morning class,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to teach
you how to die.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Because people have
an idea that death

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.001 align:middle line:84%
is a one time and final thing.
LISA GARR: It isn't?

00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
From the body's
perspective, yes.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
From the body's perspective,
we're born once,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and then at the end of
the life, the body dies.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
So for the body it's over.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:84%
But from the soul's
perspective death

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:90%
is always a recurring thing.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a recurring
theme over and over

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and over throughout our entire
journey, because every time we

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:90%
have to let go of something.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Now are you talking about
through like transformational

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:90%
moments in our lives?

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Pivotal moments,
that type of thing

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:90%
is considered a soul's death?

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because from the soul's
perspective, dying even

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
from a physical body death,
like I've been through,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
from the soul's perspective it's
just getting out of the body

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and letting go of the
body, instead of holding

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
on to the idea that, oh, my
god, if I don't have this body,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I cease to exist,
which is not true.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's been
dead, knows that.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, explain how you
can actually say that.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's definitely a
new concept for people.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's when you're coming
from the body's perspective,

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
when you approach
the bodily death,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:84%
either the doctor says,
OK, you have a month

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to live because you have a
terminal illness or something,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
or you're old and your
time is coming or whatever,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:90%
there's a sense of ending.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And that ending is very true.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But when do people have a
difficult time dying even just

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
in that context is when they
have a lot of attachments

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:90%
to things here on Earth.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
abandon my family,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:90%
for example, or my children.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Or, gee, you know,
I'm at the pinnacle

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:90%
of my career and success.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just getting there.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Don't let me die.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I want to live.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done the
things I want to do--

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Exactly.
-Yes.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.289 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they're looking already
before they die, they're

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:84%
looking at the regrets
they're going to have

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
if they don't make it, if
they don't get through this

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:90%
and stay alive.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But from the soul's perspective,
when it's your time to go,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
it's one of not only
leaving this physical body,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
but leaving this entire
incarnation and all

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:90%
that you thought that was.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
But isn't the fear of death a
major driver in staying alive?

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, for most.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say probably
99% of the population.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
It's fear of death
keeps one not living.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
See this is why I say
teach-- everything

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I teach about
psychic development,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyant development,
your intuitive development,

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual path,
everything is about, OK,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:84%
how do you get past
that fear of death?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Because as long as
the fear of death

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.337 align:middle line:84%
is your motivation for
living, you don't live.

00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: You're surviving.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You're surviving.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:90%
You're hanging in there.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:90%
You're never alive.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Once you're able to
face death and go,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, I know how I'm going to die.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:90%
I know how I would like to die.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
We have a choice in how we die.
That's--

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I just got
over the last concept now.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Slow down here.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so beyond living in just
a place of survival, when you

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
really come to peace
with dying, then

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
you are fully able to live.
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
running away from death.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:90%
And now what did you just say?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:90%
The last--

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that started
me on this whole journey

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
on learning about this is when
I was 21 years old my teacher,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Lewis Bostwick, said to
me, you know, Michael, you

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:90%
have a choice in how to die.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And that caught me--

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.341 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yes, as
it just did for me.

00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:10%
And so then he followed
that up with, well, you

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:10%
can choose to die in
pain and suffering,

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:10%
or you can choose to die in
love and at peace with yourself.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:10%
And I said I like the
second one better.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Yeah,
so you learned then

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So tell us the
experience-- now,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Michael has been through
five experiences where

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:90%
his body has physically been--

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Died or
almost in between death and--

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Heart attacks, registered on
to an EKG meter as being flat

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:90%
lined and so forth.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And we did cover a lot of
that in the other interview.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's Part 1.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to touch
on one of the major ones

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't really have
that much time to get into.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:90%
So explained what happened.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, the one before the one
that I was dead for over 10

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
minutes was not a clinical
death in the sense

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't actually flatline
on that third experience.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was hilarious-- it
wasn't hilarious at the time.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But I was driving by
myself going about 65,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:84%
70 miles an hour on the I-5
north from Los Angeles area,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:90%
more toward the desert.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And I had had a very
full month of traveling,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
teaching, attending events,
and all kinds of things.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't great
spirit and great shape.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped at a motel for
one night on my way home.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a long drive home.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.240 align:middle line:90%
So it takes a couple days.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning, I woke
up and had my little exercise

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:90%
in the fitness room.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And then got in the car,
driving 65, 70 miles an hour

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
in the middle lane
on the freeway.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And next thing, boom, it hits.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening-- I remember
exactly what song.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.650 align:middle line:90%
It was before Christmas.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It was about 13 days
before Christmas.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And "I'll be home for
Christmas" was playing.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:90%
And I like that song.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:90%
So I'm singing along with it.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm laughing
to myself that, oh,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.606 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I will be home
before Christmas,

00:08:18.606 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:90%
13 days before Christmas.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
was I started to feel

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:90%
this very familiar sensation.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to describe
what it feels like.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of all
over the body, especially

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:90%
in the upper half.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of painful.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.309 align:middle line:90%
But it's more than that.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a sense of doom.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
a weird feeling

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.581 align:middle line:84%
Is it not the gripping
sensation you're talking about?

00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:90%
It's more of--

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was like a
pinching in the back

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:90%
of between the shoulder blades.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like real
painful or anything.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's like you can't breathe.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting
very disoriented.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell, I'm
starting to leave.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And everything starts to
have this different kind

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:84%
of a yellowish
pallor to everything.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And the things here
become very unreal.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:90%
So then I'm going, uh, oh.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.744 align:middle line:90%
this is not.

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:18.209 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: I'm driving.
-I'm driving.

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else is with me.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So I decide I gotta get
off the freeway, right.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
cause an accident

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.140 align:middle line:90%
and kill people and stuff.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going, OK, I got
to get off the freeway.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I see, oh,
there's an exit.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And so I get off at the exit.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm already scoping out,
where can I go to get help?

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I realize I'm going to
need some help here.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I see a couple
of gas stations.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:90%
And I see a Denny's.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Not a good advertisement
for Denny's.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Always open though.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, well,
more than the gas stations

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and the convenience
stores, Denny's

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:90%
would have a group of people.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And they had a parking lot.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I have to get
this car-- because I'm

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:90%
driving a large SUB.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like a moving
weapon, right.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going, I got
to get off this road.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And I make it to the
Denny's parking lot.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And for some
strange reason, just

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
like my first heart
attack, I just needed to go

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:84%
find grass, green grass.
LISA GARR: Really?

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:90%
For some reason-- yeah.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
body kind of a reaction

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:90%
of I just need some Earth.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:90%
To ground.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:90%
To ground, yeah.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I park in the
parking lot at Denny's.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:90%
It's pitiful.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
They have a little
bit grass here.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Like a square.
Yes.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's all yellow.
And it's--

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Where all the dogs go.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, where the dogs have been.
-Great.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:90%
So I'm--

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
The things you're aware of
when you're about to die.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going-- and
then I found one

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
area at least that
looked like it

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:90%
wasn't covered with dog stuff.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So I went, OK, I'll
lie down there.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm grounding myself.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And you know, these
are all tools,

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:90%
spiritual tools, I teach people.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And I practice all of them.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:90%
And I'm grounding myself.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting back into my
body more so I could think

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and decide what to do next.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.821 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, well, first
thing I'll call Raphaelle.

00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Your wife?

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was also thinking--
yes, my wife, who was at home--

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'm also
thinking, oh, yeah, I

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:84%
had this prescription of
nitros, nitroglycerin tablets.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:84%
The doctors prescribes it
for heart patients in case

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:84%
you have angina and
stuff like that.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Never used it.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Never needed to.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:90%
And so I had it in there.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:90%
I bring it out.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:84%
It's so old but all the
instructions are rubbed off.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever
I could see it's

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:84%
so tiny, microscopic
instructions, I can't read it.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:90%
So I call her.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And immediately-- oh, when I
called, she was on the phone.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:90%
I called the home phone.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And it went straight
to voice mail.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I went, uh, oh.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:90%
She's on the phone.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And so if she's
on the phone, she

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:90%
could be on it for a long time.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So I called her cell
phone, hoping that you'll

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:90%
see my name flashing.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And if I call enough times, she
might think it's an emergency.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, she got it right away.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
She stopped the other phone
call, picked up her cell phone.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:90%
And she answered, what's wrong?

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the great
things of living with, being

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
married to another
clairvoyant and intuitive,

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:90%
who just is right on.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Psychically aware.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're able to telepath
messages faster than voicemail.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Exactly.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Faster than voice mail.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Better than the internet.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And so then she
goes, what's wrong?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I think
I'm having a heart attack.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, OK.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I need
to take my nitro

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:90%
to see if that's going to help.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But I don't remember the
instructions that I've

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:90%
never taken it before.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: It's amazing.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:84%
You're this cognisant
in this entire process.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and where I was at, from
my perspective at that point,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm barely-- I'm holding in
to my body with a string.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm touch and go.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking at any
moment I might just go.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very
difficult to talk.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
It was very difficult to
get my thoughts together.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And so then, right
then, our housekeeper

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:84%
comes to clean the
house in the morning.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And so her husband
had a heart attack,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
so she knew a lot of things
of how to deal with stuff.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So Raphaelle says,
Michael wants to know

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:90%
how to use the nitro tabs.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, you
put one under your tongue,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:90%
wait five minutes.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And if nothing happens,
or it's not enough,

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:90%
you take another one.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, so you had
someone there with you.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, perfect.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
She was on speakerphone,
so I can hear both of them.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, so I said,
OK-- and, of course, I

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
opened this little vial and
all-- I dropped most of them

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
on the ground.
-Wow.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:84%
In the dog pee, great.
-I got one.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And I put it under the tongue.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Didn't do a thing.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, I guess
I'd better wait five minutes

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and hope that
something kicks in.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And just then, both
of them together,

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
housekeeper and Raphaelle
both said, yelled in,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:90%
get off the phone, call 911.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I
guess I better do that.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.310 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's the most
sensible thing to-- yes.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been through
the other way before.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And so this time I didn't
have that red light of I

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
got to take care of something
before I go to the hospital.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
go to the hospital,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
there are certain things
you can't really do.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:90%
It's too much activity.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know, everybody's
poking and prodding.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, OK, I'm going
to get off the phone with them.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm holding
there, looking at 911.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:90%
And I've got my finger poised.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the first
thought I had of-- I've never

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:90%
called 911 in my entire life.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:90%
I've been a nurse.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been in hospitals
working on patients.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I've taken people to
the hospital and stuff.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But I've never called 911 for
police or ambulance or anything

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:90%
in my whole life.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm about to push the
buttons, and the thought I have

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, if I dial
those three numbers,

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:90%
it's going to bankrupt us.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we have catastrophic
insurance only for emergencies.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But we've already
been through that.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're still three
years or whatever

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
after my first heart
attack, four years,

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
we're still paying
for the medical bills.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.594 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's sad.

00:15:52.594 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And you had to think of
that when you're about to-

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:90%
I had to think of that, yeah.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
These are points of making
a choice in your life.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:10%
There's many choices
you've made at this point.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.445 align:middle line:10%
I mean, in this moment, you have
had to make so many decisions.

00:16:04.445 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:10%
Lots of choices, yeah.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:10%
And this is really another
thing my teacher taught

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:10%
me a long time ago is
he said his definition

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.720 align:middle line:10%
of a capable psychic
is one who is

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:10%
able to make simple decisions.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Not complex.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
No, I found that to be
absolutely true over the years.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
When I first heard him say
that, I didn't understand it.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But over the years, every time
when a person sits on a maybe,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
the fence of maybe-- maybe
I'll do it, maybe I won't.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybes, so draining.
It's a lot of energy.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:90%
You can't psychic.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.020 align:middle line:90%
You can't be psychic.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:84%
But every time someone is very,
very psychic-- and capably so,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
not an off the wall psychic--
but being able to truly use

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:84%
their psychic abilities is
when they were able to make

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:90%
simple decision, yes or no.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Go here or don't
go there, whatever.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And so a maybe
is a lack of your intuition.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.289 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Exactly.
-Interesting.

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And lack of-- you
have intuition.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Lack of trusting it.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you sit on the
maybe, because you already

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.800 align:middle line:84%
know the answer, but
you don't trust it.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.807 align:middle line:90%
So maybe I-- like that.

00:17:14.807 --> 00:17:16.640 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So was that what
was going through your head

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:90%
when you were--

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
No, when I was looking
I'm looking at my choices,

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going if I
touch the three numbers,

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
it's going to bankrupt
us and our business.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And where is that
going to put Raphaelle?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Because she's our
business manager.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, OK,
if I don't dial 911, well,

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll probably die right here.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And that didn't
bother me so much.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not bothered by dying.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.714 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought--

00:17:48.714 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But that would have also
bankrupted the business.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, but if I
die here, it's going

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
to further bankrupt
Raphaelle and the business

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And she will be much more
affected than if I continue.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.348 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, OK,
well, here goes nothing.

00:18:06.348 --> 00:18:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And, boy, was that
an experience.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I had nothing to
expect except what

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:90%
you see on cop shows on TV.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:90%
And here I dial 911.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And the operator, 911, blah,
blah, blah, and very efficient,

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:90%
professional.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- oh, before I dialed
I also went through a list,

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want to
take up the operator's time.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So I needed to be
to the point, give

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
all the necessary information
that a police dispatch,

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:84%
ambulance dispatch,
operator would

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:90%
need to have to get it right.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, like your name.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, OK, I'd
better give my name

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and location, age,
and condition,

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and where I am,
and all that stuff.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So I said, yes, my
name is Michael Tamura,

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and I think at the time, 50--
whatever it was, 56, whatever.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And I have a history of
a heart attack before.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.620 align:middle line:90%
And I've been treated for it.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm
having another one.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And I just drove myself
off of the freeway.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm parked in a
Denny's parking lot.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized I don't
know what town I'm in.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But I knew-- I looked at the
clock when this all started.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I started in
Patterson this morning

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and I drove 45 minutes
and I came off,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and I was driving
at the speed limit.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's about how far
I've been from Patterson

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and got off the freeway.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
exit in this town.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a little town.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.387 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one Denny's,
I'm sure, in this whole town.

00:19:49.387 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:90%
I thought that would be enough.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said I was
heading north on I-5.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And the operator says,
OK, I need the address.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I need the city you're in.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And I need the address.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I'm thinking is
I'm flashing through TV shows,

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:10.840 align:middle line:84%
don't you have it showing
up on your monitor.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I realize, oh,
I'm on the cell phone.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't come
up on the monitor

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:90%
because it's not a home line.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Then I think, can't
you triangulate it.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So it was amazing
the kind of trivia--

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You had all that stuff
going on in your mind.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, at least that showed
that you were coherent.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
all the options.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.732 align:middle line:84%
And I'm even looking
at, you know,

00:20:35.732 --> 00:20:37.717 align:middle line:84%
how come you're
not doing your job.

00:20:37.717 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:90%
And by this point, I'm so weak.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm barely kind
of hanging in there.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So I go, I got to get help
to find out what town I'm in.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.974 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
got to go ask somebody.

00:20:57.974 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: You're
laying on the grass.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm lying on the ground.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And I get myself up.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'm staggering.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.731 align:middle line:84%
And it's like that feeling of
about to pass out any moment,

00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:84%
you know.
So I'm staggering.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole group of
people coming out of Denny's.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
talking and lively.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And so from my perspective,
I thought I was yelling out.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, does anybody know
you know what town this is.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:84%
A couple of people kind
of looked in my direction.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And they went back to
talking to each other.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:90%
And I got completely ignored.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that's
because I didn't talk loud

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
enough, or they
were a little afraid

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
of what this weird
person staggering over.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they all-- there
was about like eight

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:90%
people, 10 people, just left.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then this other couple
comes out after them.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little closer to the door.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I ask them,
what town is this?

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And one person said, I
think, it was Lathrop.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the operator heard
right through the phone.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said, OK,
I got that town.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I need the cross streets.
LISA GARR: She said--

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she didn't
say cross streets.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:90%
I need the address.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:90%
The address, I need.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:90%
I said, it's Lathrop.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a small town.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
only one Denny's,

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:84%
especially by the I-5 exit.
You

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:84%
You could have
died at this point.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I'm thinking can't
you get it together there.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't
realize she's already

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:90%
got everything in motion.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
But she wants to get as much
information as possible.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, she's
trying to-- oh, OK, I see.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.774 align:middle line:84%
And she's wanting to
keep me on the phone.

00:22:30.774 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Engaged, OK.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally
go into the Denny's.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And they always have that
waiting bench next to the door.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking,
I got to lie down.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:90%
I got to lie down.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:84%
There's one person sitting
halfway between the two

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:90%
ends of the bench.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, excuse
me, I'm in an emergency.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:90%
I need to lie down.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.265 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't move.

00:22:53.265 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.381 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of crunch
up on one side.

00:22:57.381 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he just sat there and
like, who the hell are you.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Oh, my gosh.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:90%
You're dying.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And he's-- wow, interesting.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So then I holler-- and
there's a lot of people there.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:84%
People paying, waitresses,
you know, bus boys--

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, I'm
thinking it's empty.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:90%
No, it's pretty crowded.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm hollering to
the general cashier area

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:84%
where there's the
most number of people.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, I'm on
a 911 call and I

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:90%
need the address of this place.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And
you're laying down?

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
As I'm kind of half
lying down by that point.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And nobody even really stopped.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:90%
One person kind of looked.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:90%
And then I repeated myself.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And somebody in the back,
kitchen or someplace,

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and yells out the street
address loud enough--

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.700 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, so
he could hear you?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that the operator heard
it through the cell phone.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I got it.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, stay on the
phone, do not hang up.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Stay on the phone.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:84%
We have the emergency crew
on the road right now.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.105 align:middle line:90%
They should be there shortly.

00:24:07.105 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, thank you very much.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:90%
And she said, stay on the phone.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I said, I will.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:90%
And then she hung up.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Or are the connection broke.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's always these little
comedy things, divine comedy.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's--
what did you learn

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:90%
from that whole experience?

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that was amazing to me

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
was in the midst of that, like
you're in the eye of the storm,

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:90%
and everything's happening.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And even in my body, it's
kind of outside of me,

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and I'm in the middle.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:90%
And where I am is very quiet.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm even able to see the
humor in these kinds of things,

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
like she goes don't
hang up and it dies.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And I can smell-- when the
firemen and the paramedics

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:90%
came, I heard their boots.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I can tell how many
of them there were,

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
which ones were
women-- and I have

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.360 align:middle line:84%
my eyes closed-- which ones were
men and which ones are women.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.245 align:middle line:84%
And I can smell the
diesel fuel from the fire

00:25:05.245 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:90%
engines and stuff.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And the sounds were--
I'm in hypersensitivity.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
really struck me was I'm

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:21.451 align:middle line:84%
going, what if I were a homeless
person without any resources

00:25:21.451 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever?

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean,
I felt so fortunate

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that I could even call on
a cell phone, call my wife,

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.277 align:middle line:90%
and get some support.

00:25:34.277 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: But isn't it
interesting that you were

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
ostracized as a dying-- I
mean, you were dying and people

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.844 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't give you the--

00:25:40.844 --> 00:25:42.609 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Time of the day.
-Attention.

00:25:42.609 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's like trying to pull
teeth just to get some help.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I think
people don't know what

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to do when they're faced
with-- they get scared

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:90%
and they kind of freeze.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know what
to do and especially

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:84%
if they don't know what's
going on with the other person.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I may have looked
kind of strange,

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
kind of crawling in there
and lying down halfway.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:10%
And, well, I mean, maybe
people listening to this

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.390 align:middle line:10%
could have more
compassion for people

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:10%
when they-- open your eyes
a little bit more to what

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:10%
may be going on around you.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:10%
But back to the experience of
death, now you had at that time

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:10%
when you got rushed
to the hospital, what

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:10%
happened when you got there?

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:26.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, once I was
in the ambulance,

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:10%
I felt, OK, my
physical well being

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:10%
is taken care of by
these capable people

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:10%
in the ambulance.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of very interesting
magical things happen.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:90%
But that's long, long story.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:84%
But where I was at
was as I'm going,

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, I can't really do
a whole lot more with my body.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure if
I'm going to make it,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:84%
even though I knew from my first
death that was a time when it

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:84%
was decided that I had
a choice to come back

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
or to stay in spirit, because
I was done with everything

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I came to do in this
lifetime and then some.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Now what do
you mean you were done

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:90%
with everything you came to do?

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Well,
when we incarnate, prior

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to our incarnation, every single
soul makes a plan, a very, very

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:84%
intricate plan of what we need
to learn in life, what are

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:84%
the main lessons
we need to learn,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
what are some of
the karmic cycles

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
from previous incarnations that
we need to fulfil, resolve.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:90%
And what are we here to do?

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
What are we here to contribute?

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
What are we here to share
of ourselves with others?

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.524 align:middle line:90%
And so we all make those plans

00:27:42.524 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Before we come in?

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Before we come in.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And we even select who we're
going to have as parents.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.271 align:middle line:84%
And then we forget
them when we come here.

00:27:50.271 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Some of us do.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.198 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Some of us do.

00:27:53.198 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Or I would say probably
many, most people do.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask a small
child early enough

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:90%
they almost always remember.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Because they'll say
things like, well,

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.360 align:middle line:84%
before I came into mommy's
tummy or before I came--

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.760 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right, very common.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I was in a room.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at pictures
of who was going to be

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:90%
my mother and things like that.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:90%
But we make the whole thing.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:90%
And I was done with it.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was assured that I had
done far more than I plan to do

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So that's
what you meant

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:84%
by your you could have gone at
that point and been OK with it?

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But that time, I
asked for advice

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what would be
of the greatest benefit,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.704 align:middle line:84%
not only for myself, but
for everyone concerned.

00:28:42.704 --> 00:28:44.070 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And you
asked the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: The council
I met with the council.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.110 align:middle line:84%
The first time I met
with the council,

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.780 align:middle line:84%
or part of my council--
everyone has a council.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.364 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Explain that.

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:84%
You talked a little bit about
it in the first interview.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the council is a group of
beings who oversee everything

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
from the individual
soul's life and trajectory

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:84%
of how they're going to evolve
and what they're going to do.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And then souls like
myself who are primarily

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:84%
here to heal and
to teach others,

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:84%
we have a different
kind of a council

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:84%
who also oversees the
direction that things

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
are going on this planet
on a larger scale.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
very involved in am

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
I going to be able to do this,
this, and this, and so forth.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And so on so it's
not just a personal--

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
necessarily die to get

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:90%
in touch with that council.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:84%
We could access
that inner guidance,

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:84%
council, beings, or whatever
want to call it, at any time?

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, to be in that kind
of a council meeting,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:84%
it requires one to really
fully be out of the body.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So unless you're able to do
that in a deep meditation,

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.950 align:middle line:84%
or when you're
temporarily dead--

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Or having an awakening
or a massively

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.890 align:middle line:90%
transformational experiment.

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But the information comes
down through our spirit guides.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Our guides will
relay information

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
from the council and stuff
in much easier fashion.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to die.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:90%
That's good thing--

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
But it requires
us to be intuitive.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And we might want
to skip that part

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and just go right to the
transformational part.

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But that's why you're here to
tell us that you've been there

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and back and that there
is a council that you

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:90%
have followed the guidance of.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And the story's about
and from speaking to,

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:84%
as I have about these
experiences for hours

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and hours, the
council that you speak

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:84%
of has such a beautiful
knowing energy to it.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's more than
just a group of beings

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:90%
around a conference table.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking about
guides that communicate

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.360 align:middle line:84%
without words, that just
communicate with energy

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and essences and feelings
and pictures and emotions.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's the form
of communication

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:90%
that you received.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's very possible
to communicate like that.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: And we
all do all the time.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But what most people
get distracted by

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:90%
is this and all of this.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So this body is
very sophisticated.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It's very intricate,
complex mechanism.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And it has all the
sensory perceptions.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
For millennia, the
spiritual teachers

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:43.810 align:middle line:84%
have been trying to devise ways
to teach humanity how to subdue

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
those sensory perceptions
enough to give them

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle line:84%
an experience, while they're
incarnated in a physical body,

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:84%
give them an experience of
what it is to be a soul, what

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.433 align:middle line:90%
it is to be an immortal being.

00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:57.566 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's
why we incarnate

00:31:57.566 --> 00:31:59.320 align:middle line:90%
is to get that experience.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, to get that
experience, to realize that,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and then to really live
that way, embody that.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But as long as we don't
recognize that almost

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:84%
everything we're experiencing
on a sensory level--

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:18.020 align:middle line:84%
feeling, touch, sight,
physical sight, hearing,

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:84%
smelling, all of that,
that's sensory perceptions.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not the truth.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Then what is?

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like the difference
between watching something

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:84%
on TV-- you see it,
and it looks real.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And you even interact with that.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's data that's
coming through electric lines

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and airwaves and then
being reconfigured

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.800 align:middle line:90%
to show you pictures.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And sensory perception
works very much like that.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not the real.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an appearance of reality.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So we take in the input from
our external environment.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.724 align:middle line:90%
And then we--

00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Translate it.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Our opinions of what it is.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And that shows up
as our reality.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:90%
That's right and.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks that's what
reality is for everyone.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's not.
-Interesting.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So when people say
when you change

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
your perception about
something it will

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.070 align:middle line:90%
change your reality about it.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is the path of the
clairvoyant, the person who

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:84%
starts to seek the truth and
starts to see, not only see

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
the light more, but the see
the truth behind and beyond

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:90%
what appears to be.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.450 align:middle line:84%
When we all these people,
spiritual teachers, who devise

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:84%
different kinds or yogas and
different kinds of meditation

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.620 align:middle line:84%
practices, one part of it
is always trying to subdue

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.720 align:middle line:90%
the sensory perception.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you quiet your mind--
that's what it means to quiet

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:84%
your mind-- is the
mind is constantly

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:84%
bombarded by trillions
of cells going,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:90%
feed me, feed me, feed me, or--

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Replicate, replicate.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.276 align:middle line:90%
Replicate.

00:33:55.276 --> 00:33:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Grow, grow.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and that's intense.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's like
noise to the mind.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.500 align:middle line:90%
It's so noisy.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And the mind gets distracted.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And we get, as souls, we get
distracted by all the noise.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:84%
The squeaky wheel gets
the grease, right.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So there are squeaky wheels
going on all over the place.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And we just are
greasing everything

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:90%
and forget why we're here.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.723 align:middle line:84%
So those are all
the distracters.

00:34:22.723 --> 00:34:24.389 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: And those
are all the distracters.

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.861 align:middle line:84%
That takes us away from
our real essence of knowing.

00:34:26.861 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yes.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.699 align:middle line:84%
So in this experience of
going in the ambulance,

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I was able to review
that and go, OK,

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I've already made the new
commitment to be here.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't just leave.

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.570 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: In the ambulance,
you made that commitment?

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:43.219 align:middle line:84%
Yes in the ambulance, I was
reviewing that commitment

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:90%
that I had already made before.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, so
I need to really get

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:90%
my act together here to stay.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:84%
See, it was so different
because before it didn't matter

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.280 align:middle line:90%
to me if I stayed or left.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.160 align:middle line:90%
It truly didn't matter.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
conscious explanation

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.420 align:middle line:90%
of death I've ever heard.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:84%
The choices and the
clarity of choices

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and the recall of your
choices are so clear as you're

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:90%
talking about them.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me think of, OK,
what's the opposite of that?

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.440 align:middle line:84%
If you were to have a
traumatic experience,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.780 align:middle line:84%
how quickly do you give up
all your sonority to something

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.100 align:middle line:90%
else taking over for you?

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Oop, let me just give it
up and lay here and die,

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.580 align:middle line:84%
or wait for something
to take care of me,

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.370 align:middle line:84%
or a drug or
something like that.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
You took so much
some responsibility

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to make individual choices
during this experience

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.070 align:middle line:84%
while you were having
a heart attack.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:90%
That is truly extraordinary.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Most people-- and it's
not even a choice.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just fear and survival
that you just leave.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my mother
had a heart attack.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And she just
remembers, of course,

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:84%
an angel coming in-- angel,
it was a random human coming

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:90%
in, saving her out of the pool.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And the rest of it was a blur.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Because, yeah, and that's true.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.570 align:middle line:90%
That is what tends to happen.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Because who is aware?
You are.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.690 align:middle line:84%
We each are the awareness
in this existence.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And so if we get
afraid and leave,

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.420 align:middle line:90%
then this body is not aware.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Wow, so in any situation,
that's traumatic,

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.440 align:middle line:84%
it's your perception of
the trauma that enables you

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:84%
to stay in control
or in seniority

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:84%
with what's happening
to the body.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all about choice.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about you.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all about me.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It's all about if
I'm here, present,

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.380 align:middle line:90%
I can make those choices.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.820 align:middle line:84%
If I leave, well,
the choices don't

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.570 align:middle line:84%
need to be made where
I go away from here,

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:84%
because this is where the
choice has to be made.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So with the
experiences that you've

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:84%
had of being through
five traumatic deaths--

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I won't even actually
call traumatic.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.580 align:middle line:84%
That's maybe my
judgement-- five times

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.220 align:middle line:84%
where you have died, what do you
feel is the message that you're

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.070 align:middle line:90%
here to bring to all of us?

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, after I
came back from the time

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:12.390 align:middle line:84%
when I was dead for 10 minutes,
before the paramedics were

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.250 align:middle line:84%
able to zap me and get my
heart started, but I was

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:84%
in a coma for 36 hours after
that, and during that time--

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:90%
and I was gone for a lot longer.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I only came back and
I could only tell you

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:84%
what happened during
that time for maybe--

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I lost a great part of my
memory, complete memory,

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:43.120 align:middle line:84%
for I think nine or 10
days before I dropped dead.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Did you go into an
alternate reality?

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Did you go into Narnia
in of "The Lion,

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:90%
the Witch, and the Wardrobe"?

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, very much like that.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And definitely, I
didn't go there.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:90%
I was taken there.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a different experience
of going somewhere-- I've

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of places out
of my body consciously

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and not having to
die or anything.

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.270 align:middle line:90%
And every night I go.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But in that death experience,
I was taken out so fast.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It was like instant,
hydraulic suction.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And my experience,
subjective experience, of it

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:84%
was I was taken to
a place, or a space,

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that was as far away from here
than you can possibly imagine,

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:90%
yet in the center of it all.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way I can
describe that experience.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And you don't think
this is an altered

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:43.110 align:middle line:90%
conscious state of your mind?

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not the mind.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:51.863 align:middle line:84%
The mind only can experience
where you are or what you do.

00:38:51.863 --> 00:38:53.463 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Or an altered
state of consciousness,

00:38:53.463 --> 00:38:55.450 align:middle line:90%
is it different from that?

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was beyond
consciousness.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, it
was beyond the mind.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:90%
It was just beyond the mind.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It was just during--
again, there's no words.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Once you get beyond the
mind, there's no words,

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.260 align:middle line:90%
there is no time.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's no linear
sequence of events.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very
difficult to talk

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:90%
about it other than about it.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Kind of in retrospect, if I
were to put it into 3-D terms

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:84%
it was being in this
complete sanctuary with God,

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but more so, more
specifically the experience

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:37.930 align:middle line:84%
is one of being sitting in front
of the eternal flame of God's

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:39.050 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Those are the words that
I could come up with.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
begin to describe it.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:50.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's that kind of
after, in retrospect if I

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.710 align:middle line:90%
were going to put words on it.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Was there a glow or a light?

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Is that why you
used the word flame?

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like a glow.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't flame
in the sense of heat,

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:84%
because there's no sensory
perception whatsoever.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.720 align:middle line:90%
There's no words.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.667 align:middle line:90%
There's no thought.

00:40:09.667 --> 00:40:12.220 align:middle line:90%


00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.580 align:middle line:84%
This is worth a lot of
times in spiritual writings

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.520 align:middle line:90%
they talk about nothingness.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And people misinterpret
that left and right,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:84%
because nothingness
isn't nothing.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.190 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't anything.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I understand.
Yes, yes.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.210 align:middle line:10%
That's when it starts to
get really dicey when--

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:10%
No, it really, really, really
pushes the boundaries here

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.020 align:middle line:10%
of reality, because it makes
you think that everything that

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.480 align:middle line:10%
we experience, that we
think is an experience,

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.497 align:middle line:10%
are all choices--

00:40:45.497 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:10%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Perceptions.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Senses, thinking.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, touch, smell,
all of that hearing

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:90%
is all of this physical body.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.240 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at our
language, especially

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:10%
like the English language, the
words are all about the body

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.020 align:middle line:10%
and about this physical reality.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.650 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Barriers.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:11.050 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
creating the boundaries.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you think that, or assume
that thinking is your highest

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.820 align:middle line:84%
form of communication
and understanding,

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.390 align:middle line:90%
you can't get past that.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So when I was asking you what
are you here to bring about--

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so when I returned
from that experience,

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at, OK, I've
had these experiences.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:35.270 align:middle line:10%
Every single one was unique
and completely different,

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.060 align:middle line:10%
completely different.

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:10%
And yet, I thought,
was there anything

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:47.650 align:middle line:10%
of all of that that was common
or the same in each experience?

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I finally recognized
what that was.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter what
the experience was

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:84%
of dying and death and after
and before and coming back,

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:01.830 align:middle line:84%
every single time I came
back and I realized there

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:07.320 align:middle line:90%
was less of my selfishness.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Every death-- and when I
examine other people's deaths,

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I saw the same thing
is every time we die--

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and then I start to examine
the little deaths, divorce,

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:24.190 align:middle line:84%
a change of venue, change of
career, death of a friend,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.750 align:middle line:84%
family member,
whatever, those are

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.610 align:middle line:90%
all deaths we each experience.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, when somebody
you're so close to

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.700 align:middle line:84%
or you love more than
yourself, and they die,

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:84%
well, gee, you feel
like you're dead.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.530 align:middle line:90%
You feel like you're dying.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I
would say it's harder

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.580 align:middle line:84%
for the person who's living,
than the person who leaves.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Yes, as you've
experienced where

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.100 align:middle line:84%
you go into this eternal space
it was very, very peaceful.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.980 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA: Yeah,
there's no problems.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And so what I learned was,
for all of us, every time,

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:84%
regardless of how different
the experience of it is,

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:07.450 align:middle line:84%
we learn how to relinquish
our selfishness.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
when I was in that space

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of total selflessness,
when I came back

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.580 align:middle line:84%
it's like putting on
your winter clothes

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.890 align:middle line:84%
back on from after
your trip to Hawaii.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
You got your swim
shorts on, and then you

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.185 align:middle line:84%
start putting on the
sweaters and the coats

00:43:30.185 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and the hoods and everything.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.190 align:middle line:90%
So you get heavy.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I was putting
back on was some degree

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%
of that selfishness.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us don't think of
it as selfishness because it's

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.630 align:middle line:90%
so entrenched in us.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.030 align:middle line:84%
We look at other people
who are really selfish,

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, the scrooges and
the people who just are--

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: We see the
images on television.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Egotistical and selfish.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean what you're describing
is more of like a Buddhist

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:06.700 align:middle line:84%
way of life, I mean, really
with lack of boundaries

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and that sense of
space and oneness.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But I want to ask you about,
how do you manifest, or create,

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.520 align:middle line:84%
from that place, what does
that eternal space tell us

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.070 align:middle line:84%
when we are in this
body to live selflessly,

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.540 align:middle line:90%
but yet to manifest?

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Yes isn't that interesting
that you brought up

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.110 align:middle line:84%
the Buddhists which
comes from Buddha,

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:34.140 align:middle line:90%
the teachings of Buddha.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.550 align:middle line:84%
That's limited to,
OK, OK, go ahead.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Then shortly
sometime after a few,

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:46.620 align:middle line:84%
whatever, a couple thousand
whatever years after Buddha's

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.780 align:middle line:90%
time, there's Jesus.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.770 align:middle line:90%
And they work together.

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And so Buddha introduced
this teaching of essentially

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.910 align:middle line:90%
being in the present.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:03.050 align:middle line:84%
He talked about right no mind,
or nothingness like that.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But he's communicating about
what happens when you let go

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:08.890 align:middle line:84%
of all the contents
of one's mind

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and you just experience
as is and you're here now.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And he did a lot of teaching.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But then Jesus comes
along sometime later,

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.930 align:middle line:84%
from a very different culture,
a very different setting.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And his was about doing to
others as you would have them

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:36.020 align:middle line:84%
do to you versus Buddha said the
same thing in-- not reversed,

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but he said, don't
do to others what you

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't want them do to you.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:41.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not interesting?

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the yin and
yang of the whole thing.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.270 align:middle line:90%
So they're like bookends.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Their teachings
are like bookends.

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus is the one
who brought forth

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:53.850 align:middle line:84%
a whole new teaching
of love your neighbors

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:55.110 align:middle line:90%
as you love yourself.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.820 align:middle line:90%
It's teaching of action.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do once you've
attained this inner peace,

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.750 align:middle line:84%
once you've attained
this nirvana--

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:05.550 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: This oneness.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, many people who study
spirituality and everything

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.060 align:middle line:84%
especially in the eastern
meditation route, they think,

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, nirvana is the destination.

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.160 align:middle line:84%
It's then end game.
It's not.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.870 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the first half.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.440 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Wow.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.560 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
what kind of great beings

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:84%
are on these councils
that oversee thing.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are beings who
didn't just go to Nirvana.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is why people
still experience Jesus

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.970 align:middle line:90%
showing up in their lives.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:51.760 align:middle line:84%
People still encounter
Buddha as a very powerful

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:90%
consciousness of beingness.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell the
difference between the two,

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.820 align:middle line:84%
just like you can tell the
difference between you and me.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But they have not only reached
that state called nirvana,

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:09.970 align:middle line:84%
but they learned how to bring
it back down into the body

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and live it here.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:13.560 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Like I asked
you about manifesting?

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.259 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:14.259 --> 00:47:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So in nirvana is
only the first half.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But then to fully create
and manifest here is the--

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:20.300 align:middle line:90%
You have to bring it down.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Other half.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you have
to bring it down.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.600 align:middle line:90%
You have to live it.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
when you start

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:31.220 align:middle line:84%
to live much more of heaven on
Earth-- you know the saying,

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.760 align:middle line:84%
bringing heaven onto Earth-- how
do we bring heaven on to Earth

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.580 align:middle line:84%
as we have to live
heaven on Earth.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Heaven isn't some extra,
other separate place

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.990 align:middle line:84%
we have to go and grab something
from and bring it to Earth.

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:46.660 align:middle line:90%
No, it's right here.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Earth is kind of
superimposed upon it.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to be like
archaeologists

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and dig it up and
go, hey, everybody,

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:59.170 align:middle line:84%
all you see is this dirt and
trash and rubble on the ground.

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.720 align:middle line:84%
If you dust it off a
little bit, there's gold.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:07.050 align:middle line:90%
So where is joy in this wheel?

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.450 align:middle line:84%
MICHAEL TAMURA:
Right here, inside.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But I'm looking at
this as a circle.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you're saying the
first half is nirvana,

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:16.720 align:middle line:90%
nothingness, oneness.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you come
full circle to a place

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:26.060 align:middle line:84%
of manifestation, heaven on
Earth, does joy happen there?

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Joy is already
within each of us,

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.970 align:middle line:84%
from the most depressed person
to the most joyous person,

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.680 align:middle line:90%
and a peaceful person.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And the joy is unending.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Spirit is never ending.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.250 align:middle line:90%
It's limitless.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.070 align:middle line:90%
It's never ending.

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't begin
somewhere and end somewhere.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go from
here to there.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:55.310 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere all the time.

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:59.384 align:middle line:84%
It's just that most of us
live our lives like this.

00:48:59.384 --> 00:49:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Either, or.

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, you're
absolutely right.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm
thinking-- I mean, this

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:04.560 align:middle line:90%
is an incredible conversation.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we do, we
live in dichotomies.

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Either or.

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:09.180 align:middle line:90%
This or that.

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Have, have not.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.180 align:middle line:90%
With, without.

00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
it's the same energy?

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you have to be--
in this physical world,

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:22.050 align:middle line:84%
it looks like there's
night and then there's day.

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But you know, that if you wait
through the night, day comes.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you wait through
the day, night comes.

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's just we don't
experience it at the same time.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.630 align:middle line:84%
But just because
we don't experience

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.770 align:middle line:84%
two so-called polar
opposites at the same time

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:43.390 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they don't
exist at the same time.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Night is on the other
side of the planet

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.870 align:middle line:84%
while we have day on
this side of the planet.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So you know that night
and day are co-existing.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you go--
the mind is in a sense

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.905 align:middle line:90%
programmed for either or.

00:50:00.905 --> 00:50:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Like a computer works either
or, 0 or 1, 0 or 1, on or off,

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:07.550 align:middle line:90%
on or off, on or off.

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the electricity
moves through the mechanism.

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:16.100 align:middle line:84%
The mind can be trained that
way, to think in either or.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Then you have what we
call rational thought

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:24.291 align:middle line:84%
of deducing a plus b equals
c, and then therefore,

00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:90%
and therefore.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And you have a linear level
of reasoning-- either, or.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Then if we go beyond that,
we have how spirit works.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:39.120 align:middle line:90%
It's both, and.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.990 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exclude.

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.770 align:middle line:90%
It includes.

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So back to your
question of how do

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:50.160 align:middle line:84%
we manifest that heaven
or joy or miracle

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.410 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
that we experience,

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:55.630 align:middle line:84%
whether you call it on the other
side or deep within ourselves,

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:57.050 align:middle line:90%
how do we manifest that?

00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:58.235 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very easy.

00:50:58.235 --> 00:51:02.950 align:middle line:84%
A much simpler word than
manifestation is sharing.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.450 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: It's an
inclusive conversation.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:08.295 align:middle line:10%
I am so grateful that
you brought this up.

00:51:08.295 --> 00:51:10.100 align:middle line:10%
It always brings me to tears,
because you what you're

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.900 align:middle line:10%
speaking is such a truth.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.820 align:middle line:10%
It's such beautiful truth.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.660 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, you are, in my
opinion, one of the master

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.770 align:middle line:10%
spiritual teachers out
there, ahead of your time.

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've known you for
20 something years.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:26.080 align:middle line:90%
So I speak from experience.

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But the concepts that you are
talking about are so advanced.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.420 align:middle line:90%
It's almost super consciousness.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:38.440 align:middle line:84%
There's so ahead of the
general new age consciousness

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.420 align:middle line:90%
talk that's going on right now.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:44.840 align:middle line:84%
It takes a person who can
really grasp these concepts

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.930 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
beauty of what it

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.230 align:middle line:90%
is that you're talking about.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.110 align:middle line:90%
You go beyond competition.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.540 align:middle line:90%
You go beyond separation.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:57.430 align:middle line:84%
You go beyond the haves and
the have nots to inclusion

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.680 align:middle line:90%
all the way around.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.400 align:middle line:90%
It eliminates the 99 or the 1.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.550 align:middle line:90%
It eliminates all of it.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:08.085 align:middle line:84%
It's a very advanced
concept in a way.

00:52:08.085 --> 00:52:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But most every little
child knows this.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:15.890 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Every little
child and every centenarian.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the in-between
that gets hard core.

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:21.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the in-between that
need to figure this out.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So practically, when you are
living your life with having

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:29.710 align:middle line:84%
a job and getting to
get the bills paid,

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and how do you push the elevator
button up to enlightenment

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:37.072 align:middle line:90%
and not have to do any of that?

00:52:37.072 --> 00:52:38.390 align:middle line:90%
It's so funny because--

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:40.120 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Can we
just bypass all that?

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.160 align:middle line:84%
We did push the elevator
button down in this building.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't--
the door would close,

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.804 align:middle line:90%
but it wouldn't go anywhere.

00:52:46.804 --> 00:52:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm working on that,
how to push the elevator.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:54.210 align:middle line:90%
The practicality of it all.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:55.800 align:middle line:90%
The joke is on us.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But that whole level of
manifesting heaven on Earth

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and bringing joy
into one's life,

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.150 align:middle line:84%
you can't bring joy
into your life only.

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:08.330 align:middle line:90%
The joy is contagious.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:10.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't just bring it
into your life and go, OK,

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.560 align:middle line:90%
this is my joy.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
going to have any.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Go, get away from me.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.190 align:middle line:90%
This is my joy.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.510 align:middle line:90%
It works through sharing.

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.680 align:middle line:10%
That's why we all learned
the most important

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.180 align:middle line:10%
thing in kindergarten.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.640 align:middle line:10%
Every one of us who went
to kindergarten, somewhere

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.340 align:middle line:10%
along the way, the teacher
says, OK, children,

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.120 align:middle line:10%
if you bring something
to class, you

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.380 align:middle line:10%
have to share it with everyone.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
most single most important

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.030 align:middle line:84%
thing we learned
in school we learn

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.150 align:middle line:90%
in kindergarten is to share.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And if we actually
learn it in kindergarten

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and practice it
throughout our lives,

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.280 align:middle line:90%
we would all be enlightened.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Because why don't
we like to share?

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've heard
so many people go,

00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:57.950 align:middle line:90%
well, I have nothing to share.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm poor.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any money.

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Or I didn't go to school.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:04.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a PhD.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Or I haven't traveled like you.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't have those
gifts or whatever.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:11.470 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.500 align:middle line:84%
All the people who
don't share like that

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.736 align:middle line:84%
are looking at what
they don't have.

00:54:16.736 --> 00:54:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't share
anything I don't have.

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:23.420 align:middle line:90%
And I never try.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I never try to share something
I don't have because that

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:31.330 align:middle line:90%
would be ridiculous.

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't share
something I don't have.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But when I find something
I do have-- I mean,

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we've all
had experiences

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:46.260 align:middle line:84%
where we got really enthusiastic
and bake too many cookies.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.220 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to eat it.

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Our family can't eat it all.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It's going to spoil
if we just hoard it.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So we go, have a cookie,
here have a cookie.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And we share it.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do people start to think
that they don't have something

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.360 align:middle line:90%
incredibly valuable to share?

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I have never met a
single human being

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:07.270 align:middle line:84%
who didn't have a goldmine
to share of something.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:09.860 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: Oh, wow, not
just something small.

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:10.880 align:middle line:90%
A goldmine.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.460 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not, oh, this person
has a little bit to share

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and that person
has a lot to share.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:19.320 align:middle line:84%
No, this person shares little
and that person shares a lot.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not they don't have it.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't see it.

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:26.910 align:middle line:84%
If you don't appreciate
what's inside,

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:28.740 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to if
you're not going to think

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.220 align:middle line:90%
there's anything to share.

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like how many people
live their lives going,

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:36.370 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm just a regular guy.

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:37.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm nobody.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:38.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not--

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You've had those
special experiences.

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.535 align:middle line:90%
You go teach it.

00:55:40.535 --> 00:55:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, you're different.

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.720 align:middle line:84%
No, what makes my
experiences special is

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.170 align:middle line:90%
that I see that in everybody.

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.690 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: And it's a great
message to tell people.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Share whatever you do
have, whatever you do have.

00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And if we all could do
that, this world would

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:01.220 align:middle line:90%
be an absolutely amazing place.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:90%
MICHAEL TAMURA: It is.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:03.860 align:middle line:10%
It's an amazing place.

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.870 align:middle line:10%
But people are holding it.

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:08.150 align:middle line:10%
LISA GARR: Sharing
more amazing then.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:11.401 align:middle line:10%
Sharing means let
your light out.

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:12.100 align:middle line:10%
Shine your light.

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think we talked about this
last time, when you were asking

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:19.960 align:middle line:84%
me about seeing people's
auras and the light emanating

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.720 align:middle line:90%
from everybody.

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And you said, do
you see some people

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:26.441 align:middle line:84%
as really bright and other
people was not so dark

00:56:26.441 --> 00:56:27.140 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, everyone
this bright.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people, they
shroud their light and saying,

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.670 align:middle line:90%
don't look.

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have once again
blown through a whole hour.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And it felt like five minutes.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And your stories
are so incredible.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But I really wanted to come back
and teach some of the lessons

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that you have learned and that
you have to share with us.

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can share this
interview with your friends.

00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can learn more
about Michael Tamura.

00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You can watch a replay of my
interview with Michael Tamura

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.660 align:middle line:84%

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.320 align:middle line:90%
As always.

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Michael Tamura, incredible
spiritual teacher.

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.820 align:middle line:84%

much for being with me.

I invite you to stay inspired.
