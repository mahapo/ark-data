00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello and welcome.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.210 align:middle line:10%
We are broadcasting from
beautiful downtown Denver,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.740 align:middle line:10%
Colorado where
Gaiam TV is located.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So do you ever wonder what it
means to break an old habit,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:84%
or do you wonder why
it's so hard to break?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And do you want to learn how
to be more positive and more

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:84%
resilient, but you
just don't know how?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:84%
What if you saw what it
looks like physically

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:84%
in the brain for the brain
to be stuck in a pattern.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Or even better, what
it looks like when

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
you break an old habit and
you create a positive change.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:84%
These images we're
going to show you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:90%
later made a huge impact on me.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:84%
What it means to be
literally rewiring the brain.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is neuroscientist
and also an expert in brain

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
function and brain chemistry,
and also one of the scientists

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.291 align:middle line:84%
from the film "What the Bleep
Do We Know!?," Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Hi Lisa.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great to have you here.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Happy
to be with you.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going to
make some changes today.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: I hope.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going to
break some habits, Joe.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Alright,
let's do it.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have
an enormous amount

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
of credibility in this area,
because you did this yourself

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:90%
physically.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this
happened a while ago,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
but if you could just remind
our listeners how you healed

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:84%
your body completely from a
massive spinal cord injury.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I think
in order for us to wake up,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:90%
we need a wake up call.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:90%
And in 1986, I got the call.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.141 align:middle line:84%
I was in a triathlon in
Palm Springs, California.

00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:31.765 align:middle line:84%
I was in the biking
portion of the race

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:34.636 align:middle line:84%
and I was negotiating a
turn, and the police officer

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.135 align:middle line:84%
that was helping
me to make the turn

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
had his back to the
oncoming traffic.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So the moment I made the turn,
this four wheel drive Bronco

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
going 55 miles an hour just
clipped me from behind.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And I landed pretty
squarely on the ground

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately wound up breaking
six vertebrae in my spine.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:10%
Some bone fragments
on the spinal cord,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:10%
and it had created some
neurological problems for me.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:10%
And the conventional
treatment for that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:10%
is a Harrington
rod surgery where

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.355 align:middle line:10%
they cut the back parts
of your vertebrae off

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:08.925 align:middle line:10%
and then they screw in these
long stainless steel rods.

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's not just
one surgery, that's multiple,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.175 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, it
could be multiple.

00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.843 align:middle line:84%
But the purpose of
the Harrington rods

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
is to pull the spine
back-- the spinal column

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
off the spinal cord
to stabilize it.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like a
good idea for any patient

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
that I see with that condition,
I would recommend surgery.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But this was me, and I wasn't
so quick to just rush into it.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:10%
So after four opinions from
four of the leading surgeons

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:10%
in Southern California,
I really had

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:10%
to make a significant decision.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Do I weigh my old beliefs
against a new paradigm

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and jump off into the unknown
and try something new?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:84%
If there's an intelligence
that's giving us life,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:90%
could I make contact with it?

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Could I give it a specific
plan, instructions, a template,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and then surrender
it to a greater mind

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to do
the healing for me?

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Or do I stick with
the conventional model

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and take the safe route and
possibly have a handicap

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and live on
addictive medications

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:90%
the rest of my life?

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to go from
a philosophical realm

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and to initiate that, to try
to create a new experience.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's so
much science behind how

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
the medications and
the surgery works,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and that has all been documented
and verified and so forth.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So it would make
sense, and most of us

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.649 align:middle line:90%
make decisions based on that.

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this has been proven.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:90%
It's been done before.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.355 align:middle line:90%
People have survived.

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
They have this kind
of quality of life.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.022 align:middle line:90%
The other isn't so proven.

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was accused of
having post traumatic stress

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
disorder and that I hit
my head and this was not

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
a logical decision
for a young guy.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But I mean really,
upon reflection,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:90%
it's really just two models.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a mechanistic
model of reality

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
where when things
break, you fix them.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But then there's also a
vitalistic model of reality

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:90%
that transcends materialism.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And that vitalistic model
says that there's energy,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
there's information,
there's an intelligence

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
that's organizing
trillions of functions

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
per second in every
cell of your body.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And if that intelligence is a
consciousness and an awareness,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
then maybe you can
become present with it

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
enough to begin to give
it some instructions.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, hell, I
might as well take a chance.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I can't heal my back, but a
greater mind can do it for me.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So I thought if my will matches
its will, if my mind matches

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
its mind, and if my love for
life matches its love for life,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:90%
it should answer the call.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to develop
a relationship with it

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and give it really
specific instructions.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.517 align:middle line:84%
And if I lost my focus or
if I lost my attention,

00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I would stop and
start all over again.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.831 align:middle line:84%
And that's really when
I started to learn

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
about the mind and the
brain, because I realized

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:90%
how unfocused I was, number one.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And number two, when
we're in crisis or trauma,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.326 align:middle line:84%
we wind up focusing
on what we don't want

00:04:51.326 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:90%
instead of what we do want.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So turning that
battleship around

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.169 align:middle line:90%
was my dark night of the soul.

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huge.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I think
after about six weeks,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.765 align:middle line:84%
though, I started noticing
some very significant changes.

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:03.182 align:middle line:84%
That was the moment when I
started noticing those changes,

00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:05.098 align:middle line:84%
that what I was doing
was making a difference.

00:05:05.098 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I started doing
it with more passion.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was your
specific practice?

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
What did you do in those
moments, the small moments?

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.479 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I
mean I thought this idea

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that the power that made
the body heals the body.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believe
that to this day.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
quantum model of reality

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:84%
explains healing
better than anything.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
explain how even

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
a cut heals without bringing
in the quantum model.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can talk
about molecules,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and circuits, and chemicals, and
attractions, and propulsion--

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And cells
and so forth, yeah--

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.438 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But that's
really not how it works.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a model
that's very limited.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So I said if the power that
made the body heals the body,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and this consciousness
is an awareness,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and awareness is
paying attention,

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
then I have to be
completely present with it.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.172 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you're with your
daughter and she's with you,

00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
she knows when you're present
with her and when you're not.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And you know when she's present
with you and when you're not.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And this intelligence
requires our presence,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:84%
which means your mind
can't wander to the future

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:84%
or to the past and to
extraneous information.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
completely present.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to create a
very specific instruction.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to reconstruct every
single one of my vertebrae step

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
by step from start
to stop, and repair

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
every single one of those areas
that I knew from the scans.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.449 align:middle line:84%
And if I lost my focus
because I wasn't present,

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about
living in a wheelchair

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.790 align:middle line:84%
or if I should sell my
home or my practice,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:90%
then I lost my focus.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't creating
a clear signal.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I would stop and I would
start all over again.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the problem.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I would start getting
frustrated that I lost my focus.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got
emotional, I got frustrated,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:90%
then I got more unfocused.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And so after a couple weeks,
I started figuring out

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that instead of reacting,
just to keep bringing it back.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was increasing
my attention span

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And then once I was able to
complete a very clear picture--

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:84%
it would take me two or
three, sometimes longer,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
just three hours immersed
in the inner world--

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
but I was firing and
wiring new circuits

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:90%
over time, every single day.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.290 align:middle line:90%
And it started getting easier.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Because as nerve cells fire
together, wire together,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
you start constructing
physical changes in the brain.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Those changes then you can
reactivate the next day,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and they should be
easier to select.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So it started getting
easier for me and I started

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.474 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do it in shorter
and shorter amount of time.

00:07:23.474 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I really got through
it the first time from start

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to finish without
losing my focus,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:84%
it was like I hit a tennis
ball in the sweet spot.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Something clicked.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, and when I knew that,
I knew that something happened.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
feeling all the changes

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
in my body, my pain, all
the sensations changing.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I knew that
if I was making those changes

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
outside of me, I
should pay attention

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to what I was doing inside of me
and do it with more conviction,

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:90%
with more intensity.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're going to see
a video here of cells wiring

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and firing together,
but I want to ask you

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:90%
about the quantum model of this.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So when we see these
neurons that are literally

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:84%
creating these bridges,
where is the quantum field

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.502 align:middle line:90%
within the neurons?

00:08:01.502 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
the quantum field

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
is the space between the
atoms inside the neurons,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time, the field
energetically around them.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So learning is making
new synaptic connections.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Every time you
learn something new,

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
there is a physical change
that takes place in your brain.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:90%
The brain upscales its hardware.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.977 align:middle line:84%
So if you learn
something in this show

00:08:22.977 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
or you learn something
reading a book,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and you learn something
on a documentary,

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:84%
you have a footprint
of consciousness

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.350 align:middle line:90%
left in your brain.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness, then, has
to leave material evidence

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.211 align:middle line:84%
of what we've
learned biologically.

00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And so if learning is making
new synaptic connections,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:84%
then remembering is maintaining
and sustaining them.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So how do two neurons know
how to reach across a bridge

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.420 align:middle line:90%
and connect?

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Because not only is there
genetic changes taking place

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
where those genes are
creating proteins in a moment

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:84%
by moment state where
a branch can grow that

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:84%
quickly and connect-- when
you see these pictures,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
that's a gene being
switched on to do that.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.891 align:middle line:84%
And the gene switches on, and
then there's a physical change.

00:09:05.891 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But how do those two neurons
know how to bridge and connect?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the field of
information in consciousness

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:90%
that they're sharing.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's that consciousness and
the energy that's supporting it

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that allows that
information to connect.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So then you think you're this--
we think we're a physical body,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.340 align:middle line:84%
but actually we're the
field around the body using

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:90%
this body as a puppet.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin
to become aware

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.790 align:middle line:84%
that you are a consciousness,
then when consciousness begins

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:84%
to learn from something
in its environment,

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:90%
the biology has to change.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's that field
around you, consciousness,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
that's constructing that
change biologically.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness then causes
the circuits to connect.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a
look at this video

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and you can see
what we're talking

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
about with these cells that
are firing together and wiring

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:54.659 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:09:54.659 --> 00:11:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So what we just saw were
these neurons firing.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.372 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum field exists
outside and inside that

00:12:01.372 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:84%
This is really the how-to
on how to heal your body.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Well, it is a step.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Because knowledge is the
precursor to experience.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.230 align:middle line:84%
The more knowledge you
have, the more prepared

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:90%
you are for an experience.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So you have three
brains that allow

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
you to go from thinking
to doing to being.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.065 align:middle line:84%
When you learn
information, you store it

00:12:24.065 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:84%
in your analytical,
philosophical, theoretical,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.757 align:middle line:90%
thinking neocortex.

00:12:28.757 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the home of
the you and the me.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
That's that walnut
on the outside.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.052 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're learning
how to heal yourself,

00:12:35.052 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
or you're learning
about quantum physics,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're learning
about neuroscience,

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:84%
or you're learning about
love or forgiveness

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and letting go-- as
you're reading the book,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.037 align:middle line:84%
your brain is
physically changing.

00:12:46.037 --> 00:12:46.536 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:46.536 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you review it
and you think about it,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:84%
the contemplation process
begins to seal the connections.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So then your learning
is the first step.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you take that
philosophical information

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and you initiate it, you
apply it, you personalize it,

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.042 align:middle line:90%
you demonstrate it--

00:13:03.042 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You practice it.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now you have
to modify your behaviors

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.008 align:middle line:84%
in some way and do
something differently.

00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:10.676 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you change
your actions and then

00:13:10.676 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
the new experience
then is created,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
experience then enriches
the brain neurologically.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Now you begin to
add more connections

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to the semantic information
that you learned.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And now there's more
circuits in place

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:84%
that's mapping the experience
through your senses.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.012 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So that's the doing.

00:13:28.012 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Then there's
an emotional component

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that's created from the limbic
brain, the second brain.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, if
you get your behaviors

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
to match your intentions,
or your actions

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
equal to your thoughts, then you
should have a new experience.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And you should
create a new emotion.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:90%
And you should feel successful.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
You should feel like
a patient parent.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
You should feel
in love with life.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
You should feel
like a great leader.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you
feel that emotion, now

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:84%
you're teaching
your body chemically

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to understand what your mind
has intellectually understood.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So knowledge is for the mind
and experience is for the body.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And we could say in that moment,
you're embodying knowledge.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're literally signaling
new genes in new ways.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're beginning to
change the expression, not

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:84%
only in the brain, but
as well in the body.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the new experience
means that you

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.590 align:middle line:84%
have a neurochemical
change taking place

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:90%
where mind and body are aligned.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But really the mastery of
that philosophical information

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
after you initiate it
is the repetition of it.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
To be able to reproduce
the experience at will.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you can do
it enough times,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
then you begin to create
networks of neurons

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that you can
activate on command,

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and you can bring up the
emotion from the experience.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you go how
you think and how

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.629 align:middle line:84%
you feel working together,
when you align them,

00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:43.920 align:middle line:90%
that's called a state of being.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.253 align:middle line:84%
And you activate the third
brain, called the cerebellum.

00:14:46.253 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all those
implicit, automatic skills

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:90%
and habits exist.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So then now you
are compassionate.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Now you are a leader.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Now you are patient.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you have neurochemically
conditioned your body

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
to become the mind
of compassion,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
or we could say mind
and body are aligned.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's an evolution,
Lisa, of those three steps.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And so when you learn
that information,

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
that's the connection
in the brain.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And the research shows that
if you learn just a bit

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
of information, you can upscale
the connections in your brain

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
from about 1,300 connections
to 2,600 connections.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
That's just learning a
few bits of information.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
If you don't revisit
that information,

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.522 align:middle line:84%
those connections wither
apart in a matter of hours.

00:15:29.522 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Go away, interesting.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So you-- we have to
continuously review and remind.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about the study
around intensifying the emotion

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:90%
around the being part of it?

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Does the intensity
of the emotion

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
double or triple the
neurons, the connection?

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's
a great question.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So emotions either keep
us anchored to the past,

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.845 align:middle line:84%
like you have an experience
that brands you emotionally

00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:52.417 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get
past that emotion.

00:15:52.417 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.705 align:middle line:90%
That bad habit.

00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Then that emotion's
driving certain thoughts,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and for the most part,
you're thinking in the past.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that
enough times, you

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.140 align:middle line:84%
will condition the body to
literally live in the past.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And the body can't then
create a new future

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.965 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
connected to the past.

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:07.715 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hardwired.

00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But then if you can
take emotion-- and primarily

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:84%
elevated emotions, emotions
of love and gratitude

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and inspiration and
invincibility and courage--

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:84%
those elevated
emotions, then, we

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:84%
can use to drive us
into a new future.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So then when you learn new
information and you review it,

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
you're actually changing
your brain neurologically.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.737 align:middle line:84%
Now, your brain is classically
a record of the past,

00:16:30.737 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:84%
of all the things you've learned
and experienced in your life.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:90%
It's an artifact.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.104 align:middle line:84%
But now as you learn
new information

00:16:36.104 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to think about
how you're going to apply it,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
you begin to create a vision,
you're installing the hardware.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And now your brain is
now a map to the future.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, once it's a map
to a future and you

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
can begin to
revisit that vision,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and you can bring up the emotion
of what that vision is going

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
to create-- now, most
people say well, I'll

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:84%
give thanks when
my wealth shows up

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:84%
or I'll feel happy
when my lover appears.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.325 align:middle line:84%
Or we wait for
something outside of us

00:17:03.325 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
to change something
inside of us.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.445 align:middle line:84%
That's the Newtonian
model of physics.

00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Quantum model is to give thanks
ahead of the actual experience.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So much so that your body
as the unconscious mind

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know the difference
between actual experience

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.135 align:middle line:84%
in your life that
creates an emotion,

00:17:19.135 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and an emotion that you
fabricate by thought alone.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:21.885 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:17:21.885 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The body
literally believes

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:84%
it's in that future reality
in the present moment.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're going from
thinking to being

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.982 align:middle line:84%
without doing anything,
because the body literally

00:17:32.982 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:90%
does not know the difference.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So then you're selecting
new genes in new ways,

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
you're instructing those
genes, and your body's

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.710 align:middle line:84%
believing it's in that
future in the present moment.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're moving
into a state of being

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:90%
that's defined in the future.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So the research shows
with mental rehearsal,

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:84%
thinking about a future,
that it changes the brain

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:90%
and changes the body.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But the research that was
done to show that it changes

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.265 align:middle line:84%
the body is that when
people said-- like,

00:17:58.265 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
they were doing finger exercises
and one group of people

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.146 align:middle line:84%
were pulling a spring for an
hour a day for four weeks,

00:18:05.146 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and at the end of
four weeks they

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
had a 30% increase
in muscle strength.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.369 align:middle line:90%
Well, that makes sense.

00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:11.951 align:middle line:84%
Put a load on a muscle, you take
it through a range of motion,

00:18:11.951 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
you tear the protein fibers,
they grow back bigger.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.579 align:middle line:90%
That's adaptation.

00:18:15.579 --> 00:18:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But another group they had them
close their eyes and mentally

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:84%
rehearse pulling the
spring in their mind

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:90%
without ever pulling the spring.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they said
to these people,

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
when you pull that
spring in your mind,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:90%
say harder, stronger.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Bring up the emotion
to amplify the effort.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.125 align:middle line:84%
Well, it enhanced
their muscle strength.

00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, the average person

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:84%
had a 22% increase
in muscle strength--

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:90%
never lifted a finger.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So the body began
to change to look

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
like it was having the
experience for four weeks.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.177 align:middle line:84%
But the body never
lifted a finger.

00:18:50.177 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So now
the body now is

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
physically changed
by thought alone.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is this important?

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if your brain and body
look like the experience has

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:84%
already happened, then
relax, because the experience

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:90%
is going to find you.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the body already
is in the future.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can create
a memory into the future

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.547 align:middle line:84%
that your body then remembers
as if it's in the past.

00:19:13.547 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: In our
advanced workshops,

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
we teach people how
to remember a future.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.966 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at this video

00:19:20.966 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
where Doctor Joe is
describing the three brains.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.479 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:32.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Good afternoon.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, we have three
brains that allow

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:10%
us to go from thinking
to doing to being.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:10%
Each brain is its own
individual biocomputer

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:10%
with its own anatomy and own
circuitry, its own physiology

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and chemistry.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.720 align:middle line:84%
They even have their
own history, as well as

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.920 align:middle line:84%
their own sense
of time and space.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first
brain, the neocortex,

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
it's the newest
brain in evolution.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It's that walnut
shaped structure

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:84%
that sits on the
outside with all

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
of its folds and
valleys in yellow there.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the newest,
the most evolved

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
and highly specialized
in human beings.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Right under the neocortex
is called the limbic brain,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
the chemical brain,
the emotional brain,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:90%
or the mammalian brain.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It's about the size
of a lemon, and it's

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.152 align:middle line:84%
responsible for regulating
internal chemical order.

00:20:27.152 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Right in the back
of the brain stem

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
there in red is
called the cerebellum.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:90%
The reptilian brain.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the oldest
brain in evolution.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the seat of the
subconscious mind.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, your brain is made up
of about 100 billion neurons.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
If you take 100
billion sheets of paper

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and stacked them on
top of each other,

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:90%
it would be 5,000 miles high.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the distance from
Los Angeles to London.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, nerve cells possess
the unique ability

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to store and communicate
information between each other.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:84%
So your neocortex,
your thinking brain,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
is the seat of your
conscious awareness.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to me right
now with your neocortex.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And what the neocortex loves
to do is to gather information.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
learn something new,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
you make a new
synaptic connection

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:90%
in your thinking brain.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what learning is.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Learning is forging
new connections.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
learn something new,

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.550 align:middle line:90%
your brain physically changes.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So you read a book on
how to ride a bicycle,

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:84%
you read a book on how
to build a doghouse,

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
read a book on how
to dance this salsa,

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
how to cook French cuisine,
how to become successful,

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:84%
how to be a better parent,
and your brain literally

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:84%
upscales its hardware to
reflect the new level of mind.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:84%
The principle in neuroscience
says this-- nerve cells

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that fire together
wire together.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
learn new information,

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
you biologically
wire that information

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:90%
into your cerebral architecture.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So if learning is making
new synaptic connections,

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
then remembering is
maintaining and sustaining

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:90%
those connections.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And just like any relationship,
the more you communicate,

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:90%
the more bonded you become.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And neurons are
exactly the same way.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, once these neurons begin
to fire and wire together,

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
they actually form
networks, what

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:84%
neuroscientists call
neural networks.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, neural networks
are just gangs

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:84%
of neurons that have
fired and wired together

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to form a community of
neurosynaptic connections.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It could be related
to an idea, a concept,

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
of memory, experience, a
skill or behavior, an action.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But these networks actually have
an electrochemical component.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to see
mind in action, watch this.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:90%
That's a thought right there.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, so you generate
more electrical impulses

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
in your brain in one
day than all the cell

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
phones on the
planet put together.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, the neuroscientific
definition of mind

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:90%
is mind is the brain in action.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Mind is the brain at work.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Mind is what the brain does.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And because we have 100 billion
neurons seamlessly pieced

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
together, we can
make the brain fire

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.920 align:middle line:84%
in different sequences,
different patterns,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:90%
and different combinations.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:10%
And whenever we make the
brain work differently,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:10%
we're changing our mind.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.330 align:middle line:10%
So once you've understood
something intellectually,

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.370 align:middle line:10%
theoretically, once you've
understood something

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.330 align:middle line:10%
philosophically, if you take
what you intellectually learned

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:10%
in your thinking brain and you
apply it, you personalize it,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:10%
you demonstrate
it, it means you're

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:10%
going to have to modify
your behavior in some way.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you change your
actions and you do something

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
differently, you're gonna
have a new experience.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're in the
midst of an experience,

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
everything you're seeing
and smelling and tasting

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and feeling and hearing,
all of your five senses

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
are gathering this
vital information

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:90%
from the environment.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.725 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to process
all this information

00:24:11.725 --> 00:24:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's rushing back to your
brain, jungles of neurons

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
begin to organize
themselves into patterns.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
The moment those neurons
string into place,

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
the brain releases a chemical.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:10%
And that chemical is called
a feeling or an emotion.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:10%
So experience, then, enriches
the circuitry in your brain

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:10%
neurologically, but then
it produces a chemical

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:10%
that's released in the
second brain, called

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:10%
the limbic brain or
the emotional brain.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So you can remember
your first kiss.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:84%
You could remember
graduating from college.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:84%
You can remember the
birth of your first child.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
You can remember
finishing a marathon.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.940 align:middle line:10%
You can remember catching a
fish off the coast of Mexico

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.850 align:middle line:10%
and then taking it home and
cooking it, and drinking

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:10%
some really good wine
that tastes good,

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:10%
and feeling the ocean
breeze on your face,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:10%
and seeing the sunset.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:10%
And we could say that you were
altered from that experience.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
you can't remember

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
what you had for dinner
the night before.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:84%
That's because routine
lulls the brain to sleep.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned that if you
have positive experiences

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.729 align:middle line:84%
of elation or
inspiration, that those

00:25:25.729 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:90%
create hard wires in the brain.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
What if you have
things like anger,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.920 align:middle line:84%
where you're just so mad
about somebody being treated

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
so poorly that that
inspires and motivates

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.270 align:middle line:90%
you to do something different?

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Where you have that kind
of range that comes up

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.910 align:middle line:84%
that puts you into making
a difference direction.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Does that hard wire
and encase itself

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.144 align:middle line:84%
the same way a
positive emotion would?

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Wow.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:84%
We need a bottle of wine and two
hours to answer that question.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good with me.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.329 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:25:50.329 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So when we react
to someone or something

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:84%
in our life, there's a change
in our internal chemical state.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:90%
We're altered in some way.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And the emotions
of stress are anger

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:90%
and aggression and hostility.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.540 align:middle line:84%
They're frustration, they're
hatred, they're judgment.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
They're fear, anxiety,
insecurity, competition,

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.310 align:middle line:84%
hopelessness, powerlessness,
depression, guilt,

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:90%
shame, unworthiness.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Those are all created by
the hormones of stress.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, those emotions
tend to produce

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.161 align:middle line:84%
a very strong
energetic signature.

00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're being
chased by a lion in antiquity,

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:84%
you better wake up
and pay attention

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:84%
to your body, to your
environment, and time.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And those hormones give
us a rush of energy.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So the adrenalin that's created
produces a strong branding

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.703 align:middle line:84%
And we can remember
experiences better

00:26:47.703 --> 00:26:49.720 align:middle line:84%
because we can
remember how they feel.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we're altered
in some way because

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:84%
of some emotional reaction
from someone or something,

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:90%
it alters our perception, too.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
feeling differently

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:84%
because of the experience,
if we react during that time

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.514 align:middle line:84%
that we're altered, if we say
something, if we do something,

00:27:10.514 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
if we write an
email, we'll always

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.690 align:middle line:84%
say I should have
never said that.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:90%
I should have never done that.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.664 align:middle line:84%
I should have never
sent that email.

00:27:16.664 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Because our
perception is altered.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:90%
We're acting as in survival.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in survival, we
tend to be highly predictable.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Just very limited and selfish.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Big hormones
make you do that.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Horomones
make us do that.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So then if you can't control
your emotional reaction

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and you allow that refractory
period of chemicals

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:84%
from some event that's happened
to you in your day or week,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and you allow it to
linger for hours or days,

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:90%
that's called a mood.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.566 align:middle line:84%
A mood is just one long
emotional reaction.

00:27:45.566 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So you say to someone,
what's wrong with you?

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a mood.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.146 align:middle line:90%
Why are you in a mood?

00:27:49.146 --> 00:27:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, this thing happened
to me five days ago.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.200 align:middle line:84%
They're basically living
by the same emotion.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:84%
If you keep that same
refractory period going on

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
for weeks or months, that's
called a temperament.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.029 align:middle line:84%
Why is he so
frustrated and angry?

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:02.069 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:02.069 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Because this experience
happened to me six months ago.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Which means the person
is still reacting

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.084 align:middle line:90%
to the same past event.

00:28:09.084 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you keep that refractory
period going on for years

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
on end, that's called
a personality trait.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:15.330 align:middle line:90%
So then--

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are those neurons
just bundled together and--

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So then the emotion
from the experience then,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:84%
we begin to identify
with as who we are.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We're not our emotions, but
we wear those emotions layer

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:90%
by layer.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the problem.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Those emotions then
drive our thinking.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And so then we only can
think equal to how we feel.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And when feelings
become the means

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
of thinking where we can't think
greater than how we feel, then

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, the emotion
drives certain thoughts

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Those neurons fire and wire
in a very specific sequence,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:90%
pattern, and combination.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Those neurons then produce
the chemicals for us

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.526 align:middle line:90%
to feel more anger.

00:28:55.526 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And then once we
feel more anger,

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
we're going to think more
thoughts equal to how we feel.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And this cycle goes
on, and we begin

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:84%
to hard wire our brain
into very fixed patterns.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And we emotionally condition
the body to live in the past.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So now the body
is believing it's

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.860 align:middle line:84%
in the same environmental
conditions 24 hours a day,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:90%
7 days a week, 365 days a year.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.190 align:middle line:90%
The body's in the past.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So a person who's motivated
by justice because

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:84%
of an experience that created
anger in them, if they regulate

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.820 align:middle line:84%
their emotions
properly, then they're

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:84%
using that emotion
as inspiration.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
They're transmuting the
anger into inspiration

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.030 align:middle line:84%
as long as they
understand its energy.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they get in
similar situations that

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
create the same emotion because
it's similar to the event that

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:84%
happened in the past,
then their challenge

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%
is to not experience anger.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if they haven't
overcome that anger,

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:90%
then they haven't evolved.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.589 align:middle line:84%
Really what they're
doing is they're

00:29:55.589 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
saying I'm standing up for
the justice of this cause

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
branded emotionally.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't gotten
beyond that emotion yet,

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps them
anchored to the past.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:06.866 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes
that's the emotion--

00:30:06.866 --> 00:30:11.770 align:middle line:84%
like an activist that
feeds into that injustice

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:84%
in order to propel
them towards justice.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that
it's like the activists

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:90%
without the anger.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.037 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you actually
rewire the brain to create--

00:30:20.037 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So then as you begin to
overcome the emotions

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:84%
from past experiences, the
memory without the emotion

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:90%
is called wisdom.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the name of
the game here, isn't it?

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's evolving.

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's evolving.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So then as you begin
to inhibit certain thoughts,

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.535 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to restrain
certain habits, and behaviors,

00:30:41.535 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and actions, and
choices, and as you

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.800 align:middle line:84%
begin to become aware of the
emotions that keep bringing you

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:84%
to a lower denominator, nerve
cells that no longer fire

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:84%
together no longer
wire together.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:84%
You begin to
silence the circuits

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:84%
in your brain that are
connected to the old self

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
use it, you lose it.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.150 align:middle line:10%
So then there are
physical changes

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:10%
that take place in the brain.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.100 align:middle line:10%
And we call that pruning.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.540 align:middle line:10%
And so as you begin to no
longer use those circuits,

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:10%
the brain doesn't need them.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So it begins to prune
those connections away.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, every place where
one neuron connects

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:84%
with another neuron
is called a memory.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you're pruning
the circuits away

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that are connected
to the old self,

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.770 align:middle line:84%
then the memory of the old self
no longer exists biologically.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, we could say
you're born again

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.130 align:middle line:84%
or we could say
you're reinvented.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And so then where is
that memory stored?

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's stored in
the soul as wisdom.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we
get to then begin

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.710 align:middle line:84%
to create new experiences,
because the soul now

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is no longer anchored
to the emotion that

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.077 align:middle line:84%
keeps reliving the
past experience.

00:31:44.077 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what about you?

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Do you get angry?

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you get hooked?

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you get tricked?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: I do.

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:48.790 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we always joke
around about this.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think emotions
are part of life.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:56.280 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
emotions make life fun.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I react
to something, it's

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.680 align:middle line:84%
not the question
of that I reacted.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.660 align:middle line:84%
The question is
how long I react.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Like a kid.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You see a kid go, I don't
want to put my shoes on.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:06.250 align:middle line:90%
You're putting them on.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:06.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.796 align:middle line:84%
They put their shoes on
and then all right, I've

00:32:07.796 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:90%
got my shoes on.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.164 align:middle line:84%
So like adults, I mean what's
one of the greatest things

00:32:11.164 --> 00:32:12.455 align:middle line:90%
that we can teach our children?

00:32:12.455 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Emotional intelligence
is shortening

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.225 align:middle line:84%
the refractory period of
their emotional reactions.

00:32:16.225 --> 00:32:17.002 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:17.002 --> 00:32:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's resilience.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: That's resilience.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So then if they can't get
beyond their emotions,

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
it's going to become
part of their personality

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.233 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to use those
emotions to get what they want.

00:32:25.233 --> 00:32:30.089 align:middle line:84%
So it's key because,
as we live our life,

00:32:30.089 --> 00:32:31.630 align:middle line:84%
we're always going
to be dissatisfied

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to have thwarted
intentions or unfulfilled

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.095 align:middle line:90%
expectations.

00:32:34.095 --> 00:32:35.678 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot
that's going to go on.

00:32:35.678 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can go damn, ah, and
then just get on with it.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's me.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.199 align:middle line:84%
I always go-- and my assistant
and I always laugh about it

00:32:43.199 --> 00:32:43.740 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.452 align:middle line:84%
Because I always say
don't respond yet.

00:32:47.452 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's wait for the
chemicals to wear off.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's just wait.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:51.172 align:middle line:90%
Just wait.

00:32:51.172 --> 00:32:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What a great way to--

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know, I want to, too.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.230 align:middle line:90%
It feels so good.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But if we get beyond it, then
the gap between the way things

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:84%
appear and the way things
really are close down,

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.370 align:middle line:84%
because now we're not
looking at that experience

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.690 align:middle line:90%
through that emotional window.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So then when the emotion wears
off, you have more clarity,

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.970 align:middle line:84%
you have more resilience,
you can make better choices,

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:84%
because that refractory
period has been altered.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.555 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
it's bad to react.

00:33:16.555 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I came from
an Italian family--

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's normal.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.048 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --it's
just what we do.

00:33:20.048 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
But how long you
react is the question.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:26.582 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
true, true evolution.

00:33:26.582 --> 00:33:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's interesting,
because that Italian part

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.580 align:middle line:90%
of you, though, is hardwired.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.099 align:middle line:84%
And you can and you
have changed it.

00:33:32.099 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:90%
You have evolved out of--

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Oh,
I certainly have.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --certain areas of that.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:34.930 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.596 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at this video

00:33:36.596 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:84%
here where Dr Joe
explains what that means

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:84%
to break that habit
of being yourself.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.375 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Hi.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:10%
My name is Dr Joe Dispenza.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.200 align:middle line:10%
I want to take a moment and
introduce you to my new book.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:10%
It's called "Breaking the
Habit of Being Yourself:

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.940 align:middle line:10%
How to Lose Your Mind
and Create a New One."

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's a basic
premise in the book that

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.550 align:middle line:10%
says your personality creates
your personal reality.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:04.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, your personality is made up
of how you think, how you act,

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:10%
and how you feel.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So the present personality
who's listening to me right now

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:84%
has created the present personal
reality called your life.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.389 align:middle line:84%
It also means,
then, if you wanted

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:20.070 align:middle line:84%
to create a new personal
reality, a new life,

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
then on a fundamental
level, you would

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.750 align:middle line:84%
have to change some thoughts
that you have about yourself

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:84%
or your life,
behaviors or habits

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:84%
that you continuously
demonstrate,

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.040 align:middle line:84%
or feelings and
emotional reactions

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
that you've memorized that's
become part of your identity.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, the new science
tells us that we are not

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:84%
doomed by our genes,
that we're not hard

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
wired to be the same for
the rest of our life,

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:84%
that we're marvels of
adaptability and change.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And most people, then--
I think all of us--

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:84%
try to create a new
personal reality

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.750 align:middle line:90%
as the same personality.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But this new science
tells us that we

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:84%
can change both our
mind and our bodies

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.360 align:middle line:84%
because of this new science
called neuroplasticity.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity
tells us that we're

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.400 align:middle line:84%
changed by every
thought we think,

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.540 align:middle line:84%
every experience we have,
every new choice we make,

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:84%
every new experience and
emotion that we can conjure up.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:23.400 align:middle line:84%
The brain literally changes
to reflect the new mind.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
science of epigenetics,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.820 align:middle line:84%
we can signal new
genes in new ways.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But if we keep doing
the same things

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and thinking the same
thoughts, and responding

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.030 align:middle line:84%
to the same circumstances
in the same way,

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.810 align:middle line:84%
we keep signaling the
same genes that ultimately

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.860 align:middle line:84%
cause us to head to
our genetic destiny.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.700 align:middle line:10%
Change your mind,
though, and you

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:10%
can begin to signal new genes
that can change your health.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And because of this
theory in quantum physics

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:10%
that says that your
subjective mind

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:10%
has an effect on
your objective world,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.520 align:middle line:10%
then maybe then when we
change how we think and feel

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:10%
inside of us, that those
thoughts and feelings become

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.570 align:middle line:10%
the very blueprints
of our destiny.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.260 align:middle line:90%
This is what the book is about.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And it gives people
permission to experiment,

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
time in history where

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
people not only want to know,
but they want to know how.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So after I appeared in
the movie, "What the Bleep

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Do We Know?," when I wrote my
other book called "Evolve Your

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Brain: The Science of
Changing Your Mind,"

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the common question
was how do we do this.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So science is the contemporary
language of mysticism.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And because we can use science
to demystify the mystical,

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.850 align:middle line:84%
it gives every person
the opportunity

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.510 align:middle line:90%
to experiment in their life.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So can you believe
in a future that you

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.860 align:middle line:84%
can't see or experience
with your senses yet,

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.480 align:middle line:84%
but you've thought about
enough times in your mind

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.880 align:middle line:84%
that your brain is
literally changed

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.230 align:middle line:84%
to look like that event
has already happened?

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:00.520 align:middle line:10%
And can you emotionally
embrace a future or reality

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.120 align:middle line:10%
that already exists as a
potential in the quantum field?

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:10%
And can you emotionally embrace
that reality over and over

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.370 align:middle line:10%
again, so you begin to
signal new genes in new ways,

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:10%
so that your body is
physically changed

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.980 align:middle line:10%
to look like the
event has happened?

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when your brain and
body are physically changed

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.640 align:middle line:84%
ahead of the actual
event, then they

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.400 align:middle line:84%
are no longer a record of
the past, but now, in fact,

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.230 align:middle line:90%
a map to the future.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And to live by this law is to
live by the quantum law, which

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.470 align:middle line:84%
says that the environment
is an extension of our mind.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we truly change
our mind, our life changes.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:40.150 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoy.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So your latest book is
"You are the Placebo."

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And you outline three scientific
principles in that book.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain that
and why you wrote

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.492 align:middle line:90%
the book about the placebo?

00:38:11.492 --> 00:38:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
one of the things

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that started happening
in the workshops

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.263 align:middle line:84%
that we've been teaching around
the world is we've been seeing

00:38:17.263 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
people right during our
events that have MS, or Lupus,

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.550 align:middle line:84%
or of cancer, or chronic
pain, or food allergies,

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of different
health conditions.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.790 align:middle line:84%
We've seen dramatic
physical changes take place

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
either during the event,
right during the workshop,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:38.060 align:middle line:84%
or we're getting emails saying
hey, I just got my blood values

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and my condition doesn't
exist any longer.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, so it
affects afterwards.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So when you start
thinking about the placebo,

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:45.456 align:middle line:84%
why is it you can
give someone the sugar

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:51.850 align:middle line:84%
pill, a saline injection, or do
a sham surgery, a fake surgery,

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and a certain percentage
of those people get well.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
accept, believe,

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and surrender to the
idea, the thought,

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that that drug that's not a
drug-- it's a sugar pill--

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:84%
that saline injection
or that sham surgery,

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.994 align:middle line:90%
is going to produce the effect--

00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:11.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is the percentage?

00:39:11.285 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Sorry for interrupting.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The percentage,
by the way, in placebos,

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:18.710 align:middle line:90%
varies from 10% to 100%.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:90%
For example--

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a wide range.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.603 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --three
out of four people

00:39:21.603 --> 00:39:25.522 align:middle line:84%
who are given a sugar pill and
told it's an antidepressant,

00:39:25.522 --> 00:39:26.980 align:middle line:84%
three out of those
four people will

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.270 align:middle line:84%
have pretty significant
changes in their depression.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's high.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Some
of those people you

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.359 align:middle line:84%
can do a brain scan
on them, and you

00:39:32.359 --> 00:39:36.190 align:middle line:84%
can see that there's been
physical changes in their brain

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:90%
as if they've taken the drug.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when a
person accepts, believes,

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and surrenders to the
thought that they're

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
going to get better
and doesn't analyze it,

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:84%
it begins to activate their
autonomic nervous system.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And now the body makes
its own pharmaceuticals

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to match the exact drug
that they're taking.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people, I don't think
they get this on a deep level.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if you begin to
understand that this occurs,

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:84%
then I ask the question why
give a person a sugar pill?

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.750 align:middle line:84%
A saline injection
or a sham surgery?

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.307 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we teach them how
to do it by thought alone?

00:40:15.307 --> 00:40:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And so the
research that we've

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:84%
been doing over the last
year and a half or so shows

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need a sugar
pill or a saline injection

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:90%
or a fake surgery.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.000 align:middle line:84%
That there are three
principles that

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.890 align:middle line:84%
come into the effect
of the placebo.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you can teach people
these three principles,

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
you should be able to
produce the same change

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:90%
in their state of being.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.650 align:middle line:10%
So the first principle
is called conditioning.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.040 align:middle line:10%
And conditioning is
based on the idea

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:10%
that if you give someone--
this is a great study.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:50.660 align:middle line:10%
They gave a group of children
an inhaler for asthma.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they
blended the scent of cinnamon

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.200 align:middle line:84%
with the stimulation
of the drug.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And every time they had
an asthmatic reaction,

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:84%
they would inhale
the albuterol and it

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.000 align:middle line:90%
would cause bronchial dilation.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And it would help
them breathe better.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But what they were doing
is they were inhaling also

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:15.260 align:middle line:84%
the scent of cinnamon,
unbeknownst to the children.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And they kept lowering
the value of the drug.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And the children were just
spraying the cinnamon water

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.130 align:middle line:90%
in their mouth.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were conditioning
their body chemically

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.640 align:middle line:84%
by removing the drug
and anticipating

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.730 align:middle line:90%
the effect of the drug.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it works
with pain as well.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.216 align:middle line:84%
You can give people
a morphine injection,

00:41:43.216 --> 00:41:45.840 align:middle line:84%
give them a morphine injection,
give them a morphine injection,

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and then don't give them
the morphine injection.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And the brain makes
their own morphine.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You can give
a Parkinson's patient

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.222 align:middle line:84%
a certain drug to help
their dopamine levels.

00:41:55.222 --> 00:41:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Do it again, do it again,
do it again, and then

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.840 align:middle line:90%
give them a saline injection.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.256 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it, they're
making their own dopamine.

00:42:01.256 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, not just a little
dopamine, 200 times the amount

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.880 align:middle line:90%
of dopamine.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you are
conditioning yourself

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.750 align:middle line:84%
to take an aspirin every
day because it helps

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.640 align:middle line:84%
to reduce your headaches
or your pain in your back,

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.860 align:middle line:84%
in time, then, if you produce a
pill that looks like an aspirin

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.955 align:middle line:84%
and you give it to a patient,
a certain percentage of them

00:42:18.955 --> 00:42:20.670 align:middle line:84%
will accept, believe,
and surrender

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that they're taking the
aspirin when they're just

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.190 align:middle line:90%
taking a saline injection.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And their body will create
their own anti-inflammatories

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:90%
by thought alone.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, they can't consciously
make their pain go away.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:35.839 align:middle line:84%
They can't consciously increase
their dopamine levels--

00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's the routine.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.338 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --it's
the conditioning

00:42:38.338 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:84%
in which if you
keep conditioning

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.780 align:middle line:84%
the body, the body,
in anticipation,

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:46.210 align:middle line:84%
just like Pavlov's
dogs, begins to salivate

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.990 align:middle line:90%
when the bell is rang.

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.360 align:middle line:84%
The body begins
to prepare itself

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.890 align:middle line:84%
for the event ahead
of the actual event

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.080 align:middle line:84%
by creating the exact
chemistry in anticipation

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:90%
of it occurring.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So then there's a
great study where

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:84%
we talk about
anticipatory nausea.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Like many, many
people when they're

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:09.600 align:middle line:84%
going to their first
chemotherapy treatment,

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:84%
they get nauseous on their
drive to the first chemotherapy

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.720 align:middle line:84%
treatment because
their doctor told them

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.670 align:middle line:84%
that they were going to
get sick from chemotherapy.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So on their way
to the treatment,

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.500 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking
about getting nauseous

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and they're accepting
the idea that they could.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And then in a matter
of moments, they begin,

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:39.130 align:middle line:84%
their body begins to create the
chemistry to match the thought.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:90%
And they begin to get nauseous.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
if 50% of those people

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.620 align:middle line:84%
can get nauseous on their drive
to their first chemotherapy

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.870 align:middle line:84%
treatment, 50% of the
people in the world

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.690 align:middle line:84%
can get healthy on
their drive to work

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.910 align:middle line:90%
in anticipation of being well.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:57.779 align:middle line:84%
We tell our staff at our
clinic, if 50% of those people

00:43:57.779 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:84%
can get sick on their drive
to their first chemotherapy

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.620 align:middle line:84%
treatment, 50% of our patients
can get well on their drive--

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
you're anticipating.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.495 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --and
because as they

00:44:05.495 --> 00:44:10.900 align:middle line:84%
begin to think about what
the treatment's going to do,

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.980 align:middle line:84%
they begin to make their
own chemicals to match it.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So which brings me
to the second point,

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.210 align:middle line:84%
which is what we
call expectation.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:21.550 align:middle line:10%
So then expectation is
really highly important,

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:25.900 align:middle line:10%
because when you start
administering some type

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:29.875 align:middle line:10%
of placebo, what a person does
is they say-- someone says hey,

00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:32.080 align:middle line:10%
this saline injection is
a-- they don't say saline,

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:37.480 align:middle line:10%
they say this new drug is going
to take away your Parkinson's.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And the doctor's enthusiastic.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And the patient begins to select
the potential in the quantum

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:49.640 align:middle line:84%
field, a new reality, a
new idea, a new future,

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and then they begin
to emotionally embrace

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:84%
what it would feel
like to be well.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:58.290 align:middle line:84%
They begin to create
an elevated emotion.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you combine
a clear intention

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.500 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated emotion,
the way you think

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and the way you feel creates
a new state of being.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And it is those
chemicals that begin

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:10.970 align:middle line:84%
to change the body
by thought alone.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you create it in the
quantum field and bring it in?

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Or do you go to it?

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Doesn't matter.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It really is-- the
patient has no idea.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.660 align:middle line:84%
You can tell a
patient hey, look,

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.550 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do this
serious surgery on your knee.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:27.250 align:middle line:84%
You can wheel them in there and
you can slice their knee open

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.300 align:middle line:90%
and never do the surgery.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened more
than once, it's Mosley's work.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And it shows, then, that in
two years, six years later,

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.710 align:middle line:84%
these men are running
around with no knee pain,

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:38.585 align:middle line:90%
full range of motion.

00:45:38.585 --> 00:45:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, how the heck
did that happen?

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, they selected,
they believed, accepted,

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and surrendered to the idea
that the surgery would work.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And the thought began to imprint
into the autonomic nervous

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.390 align:middle line:84%
system, and it was the
autonomic nervous system

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:53.506 align:middle line:90%
that healed the cartilage.

00:45:53.506 --> 00:45:55.380 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't consciously
heal the cartilage.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But they selected
the idea that they were better,

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:84%
they emotionally
embraced it, and then

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.233 align:middle line:84%
they surrendered it
to a greater mind.

00:46:01.233 --> 00:46:04.432 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly the formula for
how the second mechanism works.

00:46:04.432 --> 00:46:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've said the word
surrender several times.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do you mean by that?

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.370 align:middle line:84%
You give up all of the
ideas of it not working?

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:11.620 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by surrender?

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.078 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: If I said to you,
hey, I know you're stressing,

00:46:14.078 --> 00:46:16.855 align:middle line:84%
but you're leaving town and
I'm going to clean your house.

00:46:16.855 --> 00:46:18.980 align:middle line:84%
If you know I'm going to
come and clean your house,

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.210 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
surrender like, OK.

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:22.456 align:middle line:90%
I'm letting go.

00:46:22.456 --> 00:46:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you let go,
it means you're not

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.640 align:middle line:84%
going to analyze how
it's going to happen

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.720 align:middle line:90%
or when it's going to happen.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you have no
expectations of the outcome.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.231 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: That's right.

00:46:29.231 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to
control the outcome.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So people who surrender
really well tend

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.959 align:middle line:84%
to be the people who just have
the most trust in the future.

00:46:37.959 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a key right
there is surrendering.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a big part of it, because
you can create the imagery

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.370 align:middle line:90%
and intensify the emotion.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the surrendering
has a huge part

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to do with it, because
you let go of the control.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.206 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
get out of the way.

00:46:51.206 --> 00:46:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen hundreds
of brain scans,

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and we know that you and I are
at our best when we get out

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:55.900 align:middle line:90%
of the way.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So the second point
is expectation.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the third--

00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.758 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And
we've taught people

00:46:59.758 --> 00:47:01.269 align:middle line:90%
how to do that exact thing.

00:47:01.269 --> 00:47:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Number one, if we're going
back to the first one,

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:04.726 align:middle line:84%
we've taught them
how to condition

00:47:04.726 --> 00:47:05.880 align:middle line:90%
their body to a new mind.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.250 align:middle line:90%
We do that in our workshops.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.700 align:middle line:84%
In the second
scenario, we have them

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.960 align:middle line:84%
select the potential
in the quantum field,

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:84%
emotionally embrace it, begin
to teach their body emotionally

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.620 align:middle line:84%
what it's going to feel
like ahead of the event.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we allow them to
surrender to a greater mind

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and to live as if their
prayer's already answered.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's that exact
mechanism that

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:27.280 align:middle line:84%
begins to start the
healing process.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.050 align:middle line:10%
But the third thing is
called assigning meaning.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.150 align:middle line:10%
And when you assign
meaning to something,

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.810 align:middle line:10%
you increase your intention.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:35.130 align:middle line:10%
Here is a great experiment.

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:36.880 align:middle line:84%
They took a group of
Latin American maids

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that worked in a hotel, and
they followed them around in one

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:40.460 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And they saw them flipping
mattresses, and moving

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:47.200 align:middle line:84%
furniture, and scrubbing
the walls of the bathroom,

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and making beds,
and pushing carts.

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists realized
that these women were actually

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.354 align:middle line:84%
exceeding the Surgeon General's
requirement for exercise.

00:47:59.354 --> 00:48:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, they didn't know
that they were doing it.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So they divided them
into two groups.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.180 align:middle line:84%
They allowed one
to continue doing

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.034 align:middle line:90%
what they were doing mindlessly.

00:48:06.034 --> 00:48:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And they selected
the other group,

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and they said do you know
the benefits of exercise?

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.820 align:middle line:84%
You're actually burning more
calories than you're making.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of them
were overweight.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, exercise
helps reduce body fat.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.070 align:middle line:84%
It helps to lower
your heart rate.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It will change your
lean body mass.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:90%
It'll increase your self esteem.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And they told them all
the benefits of exercise.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, in one month,
without changing anything,

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:35.900 align:middle line:90%
those women lost weight.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.539 align:middle line:84%
Their heart rate
went down 10 points.

00:48:37.539 --> 00:48:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Intersting.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.038 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: They had
greater self esteem.

00:48:40.038 --> 00:48:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Their lean body mass
ratio was better.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they put intention or
they assigned meaning to what

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.250 align:middle line:90%
they were doing.

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So the more you know, the
better results you get.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So when a doctor says
we have this new drug,

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and he or she is
enthusiastic about it,

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:03.270 align:middle line:84%
or a person begins to understand
because they're participating

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.775 align:middle line:84%
in their therapy what
they're doing and why--

00:49:05.775 --> 00:49:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Participating
in their therapy.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --they're
taking responsibility.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.972 align:middle line:84%
That's why we use so
much scientific knowledge

00:49:11.972 --> 00:49:12.680 align:middle line:90%
in our workshops.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we want people to
understand what they're doing

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:15.440 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So that there's nothing
left to conjecture,

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.674 align:middle line:84%
nothing left to faith,
nothing left to dogma.

00:49:19.674 --> 00:49:21.590 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly what
they're doing and when.

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you assign
meaning to something,

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:26.130 align:middle line:90%
you increase the intention.

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.790 align:middle line:84%
It's when you
then-- the more you

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:31.090 align:middle line:84%
know, the better
results you get.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That explains a lot
in terms of placebo and why.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.576 align:middle line:84%
And I like the fact that
you don't leave it up

00:49:35.576 --> 00:49:37.580 align:middle line:84%
to chance or circumstance,
that you actually

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.380 align:middle line:84%
scientifically validate these
points around the placebo.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at Dr
Joe talking about his new book,

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:46.645 align:middle line:90%
"You are the Placebo."

00:49:46.645 --> 00:49:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Hi.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:49.142 align:middle line:90%
My name is Doctor Joe Dispenza.

00:49:49.142 --> 00:49:51.600 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to take a moment and
introduce you to my new book,

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.410 align:middle line:10%
"You are the Placebo:
Making Your Mind Matter."

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I loved writing
this book because it

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.070 align:middle line:84%
was an opportunity for me
to help people understand

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:01.410 align:middle line:84%
that they have within
their reach all

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.990 align:middle line:84%
the biological and
neurological machinery

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.510 align:middle line:84%
to produce greater levels
of health in their body,

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and produce some pretty
astounding changes

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.920 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.510 align:middle line:90%
The book is about you.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:13.100 align:middle line:10%
It's about an
opportunity for you

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:17.380 align:middle line:10%
to understand the importance of
changing your health by thought

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:17.910 align:middle line:10%
alone.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:19.770 align:middle line:10%
That's what the
placebo is about.

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:22.140 align:middle line:10%
Why is it that you can
give a person a sugar

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:26.350 align:middle line:10%
pill, a saline injection,
or perform a fake surgery,

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:28.820 align:middle line:10%
and a certain percentage
of those people

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:32.510 align:middle line:10%
actually have greater effects
in healing than the people who

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.910 align:middle line:10%
actually got the real
drug, got the real surgery?

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:39.030 align:middle line:10%
There must be some
element of mind involved,

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:40.870 align:middle line:10%
and that's why I wrote the book.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I take people on a
journey in this book

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.060 align:middle line:84%
with some really
interesting stories

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:47.870 align:middle line:84%
of how people were
healed by thought alone,

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.780 align:middle line:84%
how they were believing
that they were taking

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.470 align:middle line:84%
a real medication and, in fact,
they were taking a placebo.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And the brain
changed to a degree

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that it looked like they had
been taking the real drug.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.640 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when that
person accepted, believed,

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and surrendered to the
condition without any analysis,

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.810 align:middle line:84%
they began to program
their subconscious

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:84%
mind or their autonomic
nervous system.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And their body, through its
own pharmacy of chemicals,

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.820 align:middle line:84%
produced the same response as
if they had taken the drug,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.290 align:middle line:84%
or had the surgery, or
received some type of therapy.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The question is can
you teach people

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:27.590 align:middle line:84%
how to utilize the
placebo response.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:29.150 align:middle line:10%
And instead of
putting their belief

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.940 align:middle line:10%
in something that's inert
and known to them, can they

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.930 align:middle line:10%
begin to select a
new possible reality

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.250 align:middle line:10%
and emotionally embrace
it to such a degree

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.440 align:middle line:10%
that they begin to condition
their body into a new state

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.800 align:middle line:10%
of being, and their
autonomic nervous system

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.700 align:middle line:10%
begins to make their
own blend of chemicals,

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.570 align:middle line:10%
that causes the
body to literally

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:50.630 align:middle line:10%
to respond to a new mind?

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is yes.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 25
years, we've been

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.980 align:middle line:84%
teaching people around the
world that they are the placebo.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.010 align:middle line:84%
We have demystified
some of the principles

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:04.440 align:middle line:84%
so that they understand how
to apply it in certain ways

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.080 align:middle line:84%
so they can begin to
experience the benefits.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We'll show you and
introduce you to people

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:11.090 align:middle line:84%
in the book in our
workshops-- some of them

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that had rare genetic
disorders that science

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.380 align:middle line:84%
had no solution for-- and
they healed themselves

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:90%
by thought alone.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We have scientific evidence
in the book, brain scans,

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:23.190 align:middle line:84%
to show that those
people that actually

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:25.810 align:middle line:84%
made the significant
changes, that there were

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.680 align:middle line:84%
permanent changes that took
place in their brain as well.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:32.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll also end the book with
a nice exercise or meditation

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.150 align:middle line:84%
so you can begin to understand
how to apply the principles so

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:38.967 align:middle line:84%
that you can begin to
be your own placebo.

00:52:38.967 --> 00:52:39.800 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoy it.

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:46.510 align:middle line:90%


00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
role does meditation

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:53.480 align:middle line:84%
play in the placebo effect,
instead of medication?

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I mean, if
you really want to make change

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and teach people how
to do it, to change

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.540 align:middle line:84%
is to be greater than
your environment,

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to be greater than your body,
and to be greater than time.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So much of our
life is interacting

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.500 align:middle line:84%
with our external environment,
going to certain places,

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.460 align:middle line:84%
seeing certain people,
doing certain things

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.340 align:middle line:90%
at the exact same time.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's our
external environment

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:18.357 align:middle line:84%
that's controlling
how we think and feel.

00:53:18.357 --> 00:53:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep thinking
and feeling a certain way,

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.330 align:middle line:84%
we condition the
body to be the mind.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And a habit is when
your body is the mind.

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So then to change is to
be greater than your body,

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.380 align:middle line:84%
or to be greater than the habits
and addictions emotionally

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.630 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:35.404 align:middle line:84%
And then if your yesterday is
going to be like your tomorrow,

00:53:35.404 --> 00:53:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and your tomorrow is
just like your yesterday,

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.050 align:middle line:84%
then people's
predictable future's

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:41.120 align:middle line:90%
just like their familiar past.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So teaching people how
to get beyond their body,

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.870 align:middle line:84%
get beyond their identity
connected to their environment,

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and to get beyond time,
is how we meditate.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin
to close your eyes

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and you eliminate the
sensory stimulation

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.080 align:middle line:84%
from your external
environment, and you

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.950 align:middle line:84%
play soft music
in the background

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:05.650 align:middle line:84%
or you put ear plugs in,
and you put your body away,

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and you forget about time,
if you do that properly,

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.210 align:middle line:90%
then you will become nobody.

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:14.080 align:middle line:90%
You will become no one.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.000 align:middle line:90%
You'll become no thing.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.750 align:middle line:84%
You'll become
nowhere in no time.

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:22.040 align:middle line:90%
You will become thought alone.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And only when you are
pure consciousness,

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:28.830 align:middle line:84%
not connected to your body,
your environment in time,

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:31.410 align:middle line:84%
do you have dominion
over your body--

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:32.890 align:middle line:84%
you can change your
body-- that you

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:36.370 align:middle line:84%
can create something
new in your environment.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can create some
new future in a new time.

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So our research
shows that if you're

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.080 align:middle line:84%
going to change your
body by thought alone,

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:48.280 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
become thought alone.

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So we now know from
all the research

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that we've done
that that's a skill.

00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And we know how to teach
people how to do that.

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And when they do it
properly, now they

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.500 align:middle line:84%
can begin to instruct
new genes in new ways

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.904 align:middle line:90%
and change their brain and body.

00:55:01.904 --> 00:55:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I listened
to a meditation

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:07.500 align:middle line:84%
that you did about our body
in comparison to space.

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And what was the intention?

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, the
research that's been done--

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and remember, I'm just a way
to take practical information.

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm a facilitator to take
practical information

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.537 align:middle line:84%
and disseminate it and simplify
it so that you understand.

00:55:21.537 --> 00:55:23.370 align:middle line:84%
When you're living by
stress, right, there's

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:84%
something that you
and I do really well.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:28.550 align:middle line:84%
We focus on one
particular outcome,

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and we cannot stop thinking
about it over and over again.

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And we become very
narrow in our focus.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And we become very
object focused.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.030 align:middle line:84%
We focus on our bodies, our
things in our environment,

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.730 align:middle line:90%
we have problems, time.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're pretty much
now a body living

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:45.290 align:middle line:84%
in the environment
living in time.

00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the quantum model,

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:50.050 align:middle line:84%
we're focusing on the
particle instead of the wave.

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We're focusing on matter instead
of possibility and energy.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you do that, your
brain gets very disintegrated.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.450 align:middle line:90%
It gets very disorganized.

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:00.752 align:middle line:90%
It gets incoherent.

00:56:00.752 --> 00:56:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Different compartments
of the brain

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.460 align:middle line:90%
are not talking to each other.

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.650 align:middle line:90%
That's why you feel so confused.

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Long term stress creates a lot
of incoherence in the brain.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.141 align:middle line:84%
And when your brain's
incoherent, you're incoherent.

00:56:11.141 --> 00:56:12.640 align:middle line:84%
When your brain's
not working right,

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.681 align:middle line:90%
you're not working right.

00:56:13.681 --> 00:56:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to close
your eyes and open your focus,

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.720 align:middle line:84%
the research shows
when you focus

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.850 align:middle line:84%
on the space, when you
focus on the wave instead

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of the particle, when you focus
on energy instead of matter,

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.030 align:middle line:84%
when you focus on nothing
instead of something,

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to broaden
and open your focus,

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.440 align:middle line:84%
the moment you begin to
sense the space around you,

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.200 align:middle line:84%
your brain gets
highly organized.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.662 align:middle line:90%
It gets highly coherent.

00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Different compartments
of the brain

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that weren't talking
to each other

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.540 align:middle line:84%
begin to reach out
and hold hands.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:84%
You start to see this whole
brain state taking place.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.957 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
front brain talking

00:56:48.957 --> 00:56:51.290 align:middle line:84%
to the back of the brain, the
left talking to the right.

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
a person starts

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.168 align:middle line:84%
to feel more like
themselves than they've

00:56:54.168 --> 00:56:55.430 align:middle line:90%
felt in a long time.

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, that coherent signature
that's created from the brain

00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.290 align:middle line:84%
sends a very coherent
message down the spinal cord.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And the immune system
gets a coherent message.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:05.590 align:middle line:84%
The cardiovascular system
gets a coherent message.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:07.464 align:middle line:84%
The digestive system
gets a coherent message.

00:57:07.464 --> 00:57:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Things are working in rhythm.

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So we call that our induction
because when you teach people

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.742 align:middle line:84%
how to do this and
they're sensing space,

00:57:15.742 --> 00:57:17.950 align:middle line:84%
they're not analyzing and
they're not thinking, which

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:20.770 align:middle line:84%
means their brainwave
patterns naturally

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.780 align:middle line:84%
change from beta to alpha,
and some into theta.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Not only just change into those
states, but coherent brain wave

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:27.840 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we start to see
the most significant changes

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.580 align:middle line:90%
that we have measured.

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you help
me with something?

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:39.350 align:middle line:90%
I think you can.

00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Just to make it
practical, I want

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:44.740 align:middle line:84%
to use a personal example of
something that I'm experiencing

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and how to maybe help
me get out of it.

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So I miss a lot of
opportunities with my daughter.

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:54.390 align:middle line:84%
She has firsts, or
she has experiences

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:57.440 align:middle line:84%
that I can't be at because I
can't be there all the time.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm a working mom.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's my choice
to do what I do.

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it doesn't
work out so well

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:07.940 align:middle line:84%
because I miss really cool
key events, and it hurts.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: I understand.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We went to the
Olympics in 2012 in London,

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.100 align:middle line:90%
and she's a soccer player.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.564 align:middle line:90%
And I had to leave.

00:58:16.564 --> 00:58:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And my husband and I left
my husband and my daughter

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:21.020 align:middle line:84%
there, because
they really wanted

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.160 align:middle line:84%
to go to the US versus
Japan soccer game.

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Really wanted to see Hope Solo.

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And it wound up that
they won the game

00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and that moment was like burned
in her memory, that has then

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:37.120 align:middle line:84%
propelled her on to
become a rock star goalie.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And she had-- and
I wasn't there.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I have this enormous
amount of guilt for that.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
register that into her,

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:48.160 align:middle line:84%
because it registers
to me all time.

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So how do I get over that
moment of not being there

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:53.480 align:middle line:84%
during the moment
that propels her

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.140 align:middle line:84%
every time in a
game to do so well?

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
first of all, guilt

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:00.309 align:middle line:84%
doesn't serve you
or serve her well.

00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It doesn't.

00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.474 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And
that's a program.

00:59:02.474 --> 00:59:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have three
children, and I

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:08.390 align:middle line:84%
missed certain special days
because I was on the road.

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:10.470 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just a creative dude.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:13.622 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, OK, let's
film this and we're

00:59:13.622 --> 00:59:14.830 align:middle line:90%
going to watch this together.

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:16.788 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
celebrate it in the same way

00:59:16.788 --> 00:59:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that you celebrated, or
watch the big game together.

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So the guilt is feeling bad
because you think on some level

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:27.570 align:middle line:90%
that you're not a good parent.

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.140 align:middle line:84%
See, if you know
you're a good parent,

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.850 align:middle line:90%
then you can't have guilt.

00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you're clear
that what you're doing

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:38.200 align:middle line:84%
is making a difference
in the world.

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're clear
that you're providing

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:44.650 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of revenue
for your family, an income.

00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at it
through the lens of guilt.

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have guilt
around it any longer,

00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:52.680 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
to feel that way.

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.130 align:middle line:84%
What I have is like, OK, I
have to get creative now.

00:59:56.130 --> 01:00:00.812 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm missing an event,
then let's videotape it

01:00:00.812 --> 01:00:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and let's plan on getting
together and watching

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:04.015 align:middle line:90%
it and celebrating it together.

01:00:04.015 --> 01:00:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good idea.

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:06.408 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Let's
watch the-- let's

01:00:06.408 --> 01:00:09.620 align:middle line:84%
get the copy of the soccer game
and let's relive it together.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.925 align:middle line:90%
And let's make it a fun thing.

01:00:10.925 --> 01:00:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: >>DISPENZA: She actually
came up with a great solution.

01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:16.740 align:middle line:84%
She says, mom, you're going
to be with me there in spirit.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.140 align:middle line:90%
And she said that back to me.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Or you know what?

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.240 align:middle line:84%
The best thing is have her
recount the whole thing

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and celebrate it with her
while she's telling the story.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, that's incredible.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact that you're
guilty, or feel guilty, means

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
then you're not participating
in the event authentically.

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.900 align:middle line:84%
If there's no
guilt-- I mean, look,

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.200 align:middle line:90%
I've got an Italian mother.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.470 align:middle line:84%
My mother can't make
me guilty any longer.

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:40.055 align:middle line:84%
I just don't feel
guilt around her.

01:00:40.055 --> 01:00:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I just,
I don't have it.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And I love her.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:44.025 align:middle line:90%
And so--

01:00:44.025 --> 01:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you
get rid of guilt?

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, sitting
in meditation for many hours

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and becoming aware what guilt
feels like and realizing

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.670 align:middle line:90%
that's not healthy to me--

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.378 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --and that's
not the kind of relationship

01:00:55.378 --> 01:00:56.470 align:middle line:90%
I want with my mother.

01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:58.900 align:middle line:10%
So now I see my mother, I
kiss her all over the face,

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.330 align:middle line:10%
I hug her, I play with her.

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:03.020 align:middle line:10%
There is no time for
guilt with me with her

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.780 align:middle line:10%
and that's the relationship
I want to have.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So you bring your
best to your daughter.

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:09.580 align:middle line:90%
What's your best?

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:13.926 align:middle line:84%
Your best is a genuine sense
of celebration of life.

01:01:13.926 --> 01:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what you bring
to your daughter.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:16.816 align:middle line:90%
And enthusiasm.

01:01:16.816 --> 01:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you say, gosh,
I'm going to miss this.

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:21.070 align:middle line:10%
I really want to be there,
but let's think together

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:23.650 align:middle line:10%
how we can do it--
relive it again.

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:30.450 align:middle line:10%
And so if you decide that
that feeling isn't going away

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:33.330 align:middle line:10%
and it means more to you
than what you're doing,

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:36.750 align:middle line:10%
then you have to make a
choice to leave this and be

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:41.250 align:middle line:10%
present at those events because
it has more value to you.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But if your value is clear
that you're making a difference

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and this is your life, then
you just have to get creative.

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And a guilty person will
never see creative options.

01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: All they're
doing is waiting

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
for the feeling of oh
my god, I blew it again.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm bad.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.678 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You just
got to get creative.

01:01:57.678 --> 01:02:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So emotions are the end
product of experience.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
The emotion of guilt is
connected in some level

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.630 align:middle line:90%
to your past.

01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And you on some level
feel bad because you

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:10.410 align:middle line:90%
did something wrong.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And now you feel like
you've done something wrong,

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
until you get the clear that
there's nothing wrong with what

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
you're doing and
that you are actually

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:20.622 align:middle line:84%
making a huge difference
in so many people's lives

01:02:20.622 --> 01:02:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and contributing in some way.

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:23.205 align:middle line:84%
And your daughter's
one day going

01:02:23.205 --> 01:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
to watch these videos when
you're long gone and love you.

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And your grandkids are
going to watch these videos

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to say,
wow, that woman was amazing.

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're right.

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Guilt does rob time.

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:35.020 align:middle line:90%
It does.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
It takes away time--

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: And energy.

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --from us and together.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I can now
take that knowledge

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and move that into
experience and then

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.297 align:middle line:90%
move it into a pattern.

01:02:50.297 --> 01:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Just
create something new.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.379 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yep.

01:02:52.379 --> 01:02:53.640 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I'll do.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll take the thinking
to the doing to the being

and create a new experience.

>>DISPENZA: And plus, your
daughter has mirror neurons

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.127 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want her
to watch you in guilt.

01:03:05.127 --> 01:03:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Because then
she will imprint that--

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There goes the pattern.

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --and you will
pass that on to her daughter

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.823 align:middle line:90%
and to her daughter.

01:03:10.823 --> 01:03:12.617 align:middle line:90%
You have to be the ideal.

01:03:12.617 --> 01:03:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a bigger picture.

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:14.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now,
that's the greatest

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
thing you can do
for your daughter.

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's true.

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Greater than
showing up at those events.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It could affect
future generations.

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:22.215 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Free
yourself and free her.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:22.964 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

01:03:22.964 --> 01:03:23.906 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.
