00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:84%
We are coming to you live
from the Gaiam studios

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.180 align:middle line:90%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And since this is a
live show, I encourage

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:84%
you to interact with me
via Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
We encourage your questions
throughout the show.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And we will be asking the
guests questions as well.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So you see the bumper
stickers on the cars that say,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:90%
create world peace.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen
the Occupy Movement

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:90%
rush across the country.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But what is really
being done right now?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
What's really being done
about our current economic and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:90%
environmental structures?

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Are we moving towards
a global domination?

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And if we are, what
can we do about it?

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about today.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Experts say that awareness
is 80% of the solution.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And today we're talking
about solutions.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Joining me are Foster Gamble
and Kimberly Carter Gamble.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
visionary filmmakers

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
of the movie "Thrive" which is
an inspirational documentary

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:90%
that raises so much awareness.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, it
brings about solutions.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Thank you both very
much for being here.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.834 align:middle line:90%
Incredible film.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people
have already seen it.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:90%
It's offered here on Gaiam TV.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
How long did it take
you to make this film?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.344 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMBERLY CARTER GAMBLE: It
actually took us eight years.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.634 align:middle line:84%
Eight years to make the
film and the website.

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:34.169 align:middle line:84%
Really there's a super
comprehensive website,

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:90%
thrivemovement.com.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.315 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:38.505 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of ways
we've said the movie

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:90%
is a trailer for the website.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
a two hour movie.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a long trailer.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: It's
quite comprehensive.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what was
the vision behind it?

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Why did you need
to create something

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.311 align:middle line:84%
like this that brought about so
much awareness and solutions?

00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSTER GAMBLE: My answer
would probably be 50 years.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it really has been a
lifelong pursuit and then dream

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
come true for me to
finally get this film out.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I
described in the film,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I had a vision when I was
14 of a fundamental energy

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:90%
pattern of the universe.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher that I
told about this vision

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
had the wisdom to say, wow,
what an interesting idea.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.474 align:middle line:84%
Keep going on that, and let
me know what you come up with.

00:02:14.474 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it would
be the rest of my life.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you see pictures
in your mind of this, or--

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: No, I was
riding on a school bus

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and looking out the window.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think the light
blinking through the trees

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:84%
probably helped put me in
a somewhat altered state.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
there was this whirlpool

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
that I was seeing, as if
it were out in the air.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I was seeing an
atom in the middle of it.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Then the atom transformed
into a solar system

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
so I was seeing the
similarity between those.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a
whole body sense

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
that somehow I was
that same pattern.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
That remained a mystery
to me for a long time.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.461 align:middle line:84%
But it gets addressed
in the film.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It gives me chills
just to hear you talk about

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.061 align:middle line:84%
that because that was a real
vision that came through

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And you carried it out which
is a story in and of itself.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.386 align:middle line:84%
But the idea behind
the film-- I want

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
you take a look at
this clip because it

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
shows the concept
behind the film

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.732 align:middle line:84%
and this energy,
this toroidal energy

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:90%
that Foster is talking about.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NASSIM HARAMEIN:
These toroidal dynamics

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:90%
are visible at various scales.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
One of them is at
the galactic level,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
which are huge spinning
structures with billions

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:90%
of stars in it.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Looks like, typically, big arms
of galaxies spinning around.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And they have vortices
that goes from the center

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
out to the edge of the galactic
halo that surrounds them.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Stars move from this galactic
disc out to the halo,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
down the vortices,
and back out again.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Stars like Arcturus,
for instance,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
we know have done
that path already.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the appropriate
description

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:84%
even for the atmosphere
of our planet.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
The weather goes from the
North Pole down to the equator

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:90%
and then back up.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
From the South Pole up to the
equator and then back down.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.189 align:middle line:84%
Even the dynamics on the surface
of the sun are very similar.

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
Of course here
we're looking at it

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
from an external perspective
on a small scale model.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.655 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
solar system embedded

00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy, embedded
in the cluster,

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.378 align:middle line:84%
embedded in the
super cluster, we're

00:04:40.378 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
traveling in this boundless
sea of infinite torus flow.

>>LISA: I particularly love
the visuals in this movie.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
It really helps
represent something

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.085 align:middle line:84%
that we can't see
with the normal eye.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And you have put
so much into this.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.407 align:middle line:84%
I love the aesthetics
that it brings.

00:04:58.407 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
It's like a whole 'nother guest.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: We really wanted
to help people see in 3D.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.809 align:middle line:84%
And we've been getting
communications from people

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:84%
From spiritual communities,
from healers, from growers,

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
thanking us for finally
putting into graphics

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
what they have been
seeing in their intuition,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and what they've been
using in their healing,

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and teaching their students,
and so forth for years.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's really
connecting with people.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>>F. GAMBLE: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very good.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you started seeing
this energy in the universe,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.395 align:middle line:84%
did you start to see it
everywhere in history?

00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Did you look back?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was it like
attracting like?

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Well, one
thing led to another.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea where
it was going to lead.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
When I came to the realization
with a lot of other scientists

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that I was working
with that this torus

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
pattern and the-- what
he calls the vector

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium structural geometry
that is a pair with it-- when

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
we realized that that was
fundamental at all scales,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.261 align:middle line:84%
I realized that we couldn't be
the first ones to know that.

00:05:58.261 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, as we started
looking back through history,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and I got educated by people
like Nassim Haramein and Graham

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Hancock and Stan
Tenen and others

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
who really looked into
this-- it turns out

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.495 align:middle line:84%
that ancient mystics have
encoded this information

00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:14.689 align:middle line:84%
and actually send
it across millennia.

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is what
I find so fascinating.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.521 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this clip.

00:06:17.521 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
You can see where
the torus shows up

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:90%
in history, ancient history.

one of the world's oldest

00:06:26.728 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
sacred sites, the Osirian
Temple at Abydos, Egypt.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:90%

However, there is one
very significant piece

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:90%
of information in that Temple.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not etched into the
rock; it's not carved.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It's burned into
the atomic structure

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of the rock in some
extraordinary way.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense the codes
relaying information

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
about our world also wouldn't
be limited to flat designs.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
His three-dimensional
version of the Osirian symbol

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:84%
starts with the
vector equilibrium,

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
a perfectly balanced force
field with 12 equal energy

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:90%
lines radiating out.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.955 align:middle line:84%
They stabilize its center
like the 12 spokes of a wheel.

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
The primary pattern of
balanced energy flow

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:84%
around this structure
is the torus.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Here we expand to
the next larger scale

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.463 align:middle line:84%
with a total of 64
pyramids called tetrahedra.

00:07:56.463 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.550 align:middle line:84%
If we then put spheres
in representing

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the toroidal energy
field surrounding

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
each of the pyramids and then
we drop away the pyramids,

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
we end up with a matrix
that is, amazingly,

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
an exact overlay for
the Osirian icon,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:84%
a three-dimensional model
of the same pattern that

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
was burned into the rock
wall of the Egyptian temple

continents, from Egypt to China,

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:84%
where the same geometry appears
at another sacred site built

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:90%

where the sun gods reside.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.892 align:middle line:84%
And where you find that
the ancients, the fu

00:08:47.892 --> 00:08:51.580 align:middle line:84%
dogs, the guardians
of the knowledge--

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
they guard the knowledge
under their paw.

geometry of 64 energy units

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:90%
is encoded again.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I started wondering, is
it just a coincidence

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that the exact
same design appears

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.035 align:middle line:84%
in significant places on
two different continents?

00:09:09.035 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But then Nassim showed me
that this geometry of 64

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
is encoded time and again in
cultures across the centuries

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.569 align:middle line:90%
and from all over the world.

speaks to-- some
people naturally see

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
the geometry of space and are
interested in these patterns.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I came into this more
with sort of a social justice

orientation.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.428 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: And what does
this mean to human beings?

00:09:47.428 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
look like-- we were so grateful
to work with Liquid Buddha

who don't just naturally
see it everywhere,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.380 align:middle line:84%
to sort of unpack it
and put it in terms

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:90%
like 12 spokes of a wheel.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And to do that and make it
available to a wider audience

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see
something that's-- I mean

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:90%
it's so fascinating.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And that does have such
profound human implications

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
because this pattern-- you
know as we're going to see,

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and as the movie explores,
is related to energy.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And that really is
fundamental to the well-being

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:90%
of people on the planet.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Whether it has to do
with can they stay warm,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
can they get clean water,
can they get hospital care.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:90%
All of that is energy related.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So this fundamental pattern
that's been encoded.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Like, why has it been encoded?

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:90%
What is it here to teach us?

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And what's its
relation to energy?

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.386 align:middle line:84%
Is really where the science

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to our fossil fuels?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.176 align:middle line:84%
What does it means
to our energy?

00:10:53.176 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Well,
for me the key

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is that it's the
pattern of wholeness

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.395 align:middle line:84%
And that wholeness is the key
to sustaining relationships,

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to sustaining our health, to
sustaining economic systems,

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is actually
showing us at every level

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
how to create a system
that can continue.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:84%
If you have a smoke
ring in the air

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and you cut it with your finger,
the whole thing will dissipate.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it will actually
last for quite awhile

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:90%
because it's a whole dynamic.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So if we can understand
this pattern,

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.220 align:middle line:84%
then we can access energy
in a clean, free, safe way.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
If we understand
this wholeness, we

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
can create an economy based on
true freedom and transparency

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:90%
that can prosper like a garden.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Just in an unlimited way.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing in
health care, holistic health

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:90%
care.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's the pattern that's
reminding us and showing us

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
how to align with the
natural flow of the universe.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it, in and
of itself, is an example

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
of how all of our systems
can correct themselves and be

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:90%
fully self-sustaining.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:90%

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>K. GAMBLE: It is a template.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:90%
That's the way we relate to it.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.623 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this next
clip shows this--

00:12:00.623 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:84%
how the torus creates unlimited
amount of free energy,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.854 align:middle line:90%

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: A modern day
inventor, Adam Trombly,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:84%
was inspired by Tesla's work
and by the possibilities

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:90%
of the torus.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Trombly built a dynamo, a
direct current generator

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that accessed electrical
power right out of the air.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.776 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM TROMBLY: We were
trying to demonstrate

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that by mimicking the
magnetic field of a planet

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and rotating this
device, we could actually

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:90%
create a dynamo that would work.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.900 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it did work.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:90%
And it does work.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So when we contemplate nature,
when we contemplate Jupiter,

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
or we contemplate a dynamo like
the Earth rotating in space,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.823 align:middle line:84%
we're basically
talking about a magnet

00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:90%
which is rotating in space.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And the lines of
flux of the magnet

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:84%
are pouring down in through
in this toroidal pattern

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:90%
of the magnetic field.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's also expanding
and contracting.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:90%
It's breathing.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It's taking in the
energy of space,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:90%
literally, and transforming it.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Right here in the toroid
we have enough energy

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:90%
to transform the entire Earth.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just a
theoretical statement.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.700 align:middle line:90%
It's literally true.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
To contemplate the
implications of this

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
means that every single place
on Earth suddenly has power.

Every single person on

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.955 align:middle line:90%
We have universal abundance.

I found an inventor

with a promising new technology
in the field of free energy,

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
he told a similar
story of suppression.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Inventor John
Bedini began working

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
with Tesla's theories of
radiant energy decades ago

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and has produced an assortment
of battery charging devices

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:84%
that generate more energy
than it takes to run them.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
He announced that he was
going to start offering them

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:90%
at low cost.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Soon after that, he
was attacked in his lab

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.440 align:middle line:84%
For his own safety,
he had to let

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.801 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So Paul, one of our
Facebook viewers is asking,

00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
do you fear for your
safety when you're

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
presenting this information
on the "Thrive" DVD?

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: Well, I would
say that our strategy for this

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
was that we put it
out in 10 languages

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
all over the
internet in one day.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
facts in the movie

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
have been corroborated
by third party

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and are mentioned at
thrivemovement.com.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:90%
So clearly, it's risky.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, the more
people who are aware of it,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:90%
the safer we are.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So our strategy
really was get it out.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It's now-- it's about to be
in 16 different languages.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:84%
People are translating
it on their own

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:84%
in order to get it
into their own culture.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like we knew that we
were taking a risk in doing it.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
having this conversation

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
about free energy, having
more people talk about it

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and know that it's
possible makes

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.109 align:middle line:90%
it safer for the inventors.

00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And having more people
know about the information

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that "Thrive" reveals
makes it safer for us.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's about awareness.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.915 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to the people to get
this information to take legs

00:15:26.915 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:90%
and to have movement.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
What would our world
look like if we

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:90%
had access to total free energy?

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:90%
How would that change?

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Well, first of
all, imagine people anywhere

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
on the planet having
access to heat.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Or having access to
air conditioning.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Or having access to the
energy to pull the water up

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:90%
out of their well.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:84%
To transport their goods
and services around.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So that people would
not have the burden

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
of having to spend a
tremendous amount of their life

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
just trying to get
a drink of water

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:84%
or just trying to
grow their food.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.888 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To pay for it?

00:15:59.888 --> 00:16:01.346 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Well,
to pay it for it

00:16:01.346 --> 00:16:03.803 align:middle line:84%
or to walk three
miles for it-- back

00:16:03.803 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and forth just to get the water
for the family for the day.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So fundamentally, to
free up somebody's time,

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and also then to
free up their money

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.114 align:middle line:84%
to put into things
that are actually

00:16:14.114 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
can make a difference
in other people's lives.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the
beginning of what

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:84%
it would be like being
in a healthy economy.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And one where we're blending our
systems with the natural flow

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:84%
of energy instead of
going up against them

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:90%
in every single area.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: We did have a
chance to visit these labs.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's a whole
different kind of energy.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to make

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.065 align:middle line:84%
the distinction about the
notion about perpetual motion

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:90%
is not possible.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
The parts that make up
the device wear out.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.311 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy that's
infinite and abundant.

00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.018 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you've seen this?

00:16:47.018 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: --a
cold, white light.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not hot and yellow.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:90%
We've seen it.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I am absolutely, thoroughly
convinced that it is a reality.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
I understand the
motive to suppress it,

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that-- we put out
"Thrive" for free, to go viral,

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
because we really believe that
people knowing that this exists

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
can help get it out, and
that it can transform

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:84%
the geopolitical
dynamic on this planet,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.480 align:middle line:84%
really, faster than anything
in recorded history.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So why is it suppressed?

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Well,
it's a great question

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:84%
because we're never going
to convince anybody,

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
even with video,
that this exists

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
until they can
use it themselves.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But the powerful question
is, if it's not real,

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
why are all these
inventors being so

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:90%
systematically suppressed?

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story short,
I think there's two reasons.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
One is for money and
one is for power.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a
lot of people-- well,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.865 align:middle line:84%
there are a few people who still
own what Stephen Greer refers

00:17:41.865 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to as this 200 trillion
dollar piggy bank, which

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.016 align:middle line:84%
is the oil, gas, and coal
reserves still in the ground.

00:17:48.016 --> 00:17:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to
give up those profits.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, a lot of those
same financial elites use

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
money, use energy,
use food in order

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:90%
to control other people's lives.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden everybody
having democratic access

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to energy frees up a
lot of people's lives.

conversation, Foster.

different aspects

>>ALAN GREENSPAN:
Well, first of all,

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve is
an independent agency.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And that means,
basically, that there

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is no other agency
of government which

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
can overrule actions
that we take.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.148 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.148 --> 00:19:06.010 align:middle line:84%
There is no other
agency of government

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.395 align:middle line:84%
which can overrule
actions that we take.

00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:09.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CATHERINE AUSTIN FITTS:
We have a private bank

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that prints money on
behalf of the treasury.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve prints
money on a debt-based system

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:90%
which creates scarcity.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But it puts a group of insiders
in a position of having access

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
to all the data about the
economy when we don't.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So you have a small
group of bankers

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
who understand the data on how
the money works in the economy.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And it gives them the ability
to print money in a way

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
that the insiders are protected
and everybody else is drained.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So our Facebook
listeners are asking,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
can we really be
that controlled?

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Is that really a possibility?

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: Well, I think
that the evidence is there.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we did in "Thrive"

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and on the website is
we really unpack it.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so
socially challenging

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
just to talk about
notions of conspiracy.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you just understand
it and how it works, and you

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
understand a need-to-know
pyramid structure of how it is,

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
you can see it operate in
little ways and in big ways.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think the main point is
that the reason that we follow

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
the money, the reason
that we expose the banking

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
elite and the
conspiracy that we do

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
is because it informs us so that
we can have leverage solutions.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
We're not just
looking for bad news

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.650 align:middle line:90%
so people can feel powerless.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:84%
We're really looking to
empower self-creating movements

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that are already going
on and that are now

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:84%
happening even more and
more all over the world.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if you understand
what's in the way,

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
then you can actually
create a solution

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that's commensurate
to the task at hand.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And understanding
our money system,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and how-- if someone
can make up money,

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
then you're playing
in a rigged game.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And to recognize
that it's rigged

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:84%
is very important so you don't
keep playing in some ways.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Well if I just tweak this
or I just tweak that,

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to be able
to make this thing work.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't believe
that that's possible.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And so instead, in order
to have a-- really create

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:84%
a fair economic system and make
it so everyone on this planet

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
has a chance to
thrive, it's going

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
to take more than
a little tweaking.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing that is
a way that we can now

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:84%
be truly empowered for solutions
that will make a difference

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
instead of knowing people
are good, they're trying,

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and yet somehow there's just
this random failure everywhere

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:90%
you turn.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I feel more optimistic and
more empowered after having

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:84%
come to the
understanding that I have

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
in the course of making
"Thrive" than I ever did before.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.501 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is why
you focus so much

00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
on the solutions in the

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:90%
appreciate that.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, so if we are this
controlled, in what ways can

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.260 align:middle line:90%
we really break that control?

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's affecting
us in every single area

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.167 align:middle line:84%
of our finances-- even on a
personal level with our cell

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:84%
phones and email,
that everything

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
is being tracked-- how do we
protect ourselves as citizens?

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.644 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.644 --> 00:22:04.185 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Well,
a couple of things

00:22:04.185 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that I think are
really critical.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:84%
One, to realize that
ultimately, real transformation

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:90%
always comes from the bottom up.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
If you're depending on
the next elected official

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
to bring you the kind of
freedom and prosperity

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that everybody dreams of, I
don't see the proof in history.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And secondly that
I think that what

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
we're missing is the
key word: voluntary.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're-- everybody
wants to be able to be free

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to make their own choices
and not having other people

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
invading their body, their
finances, their family,

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet, can we be
that controlled?

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It happened in
China, it happened

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
in Italy, it
happened in Germany.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.535 align:middle line:84%
It's happening all over

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
what if I tell my

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%

I would recommend

that anyone who wants to
share this with their children

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.039 align:middle line:84%
first watch it on
their own, first.

00:25:34.039 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:90%
I think that's important.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:84%

this an appropriate and
helpful thing for them?

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I know, for me,
with my children,

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.080 align:middle line:84%

an opportunity here.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
it lets you understand
that if you put your money

00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:84%
into a centralized bank, and the
bank uses your deposits to fund

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.990 align:middle line:84%
the corporations so that
the corporations can fund

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
their-- the banks can fund
the corporations to do

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
their projects, then if you stop
doing that and move your money

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:11.480 align:middle line:90%

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And the film, which
you just saw a clip of,

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.609 align:middle line:84%
is all about solutions
in the second part.

00:26:56.609 --> 00:26:58.025 align:middle line:84%
And that is
something, by the way,

00:26:58.025 --> 00:26:59.191 align:middle line:90%
that you can show your kids.

00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:84%
There's such amazingly
beautiful visuals

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
in this about our
future and how it

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%
can look if we were
to thrive, really.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're beautifully
put together.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:90%
So I really appreciate that.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some
of the organizations

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.305 align:middle line:84%
and how many people are
involved in the solutions.

00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:16.064 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.064 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Well,
there are many layers

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:90%
to the answer to that question.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Because as Paul Hawken
points out in the movie,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:84%
there are over a
million, probably

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
more like two million
organizations worldwide,

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:84%
independent, who are
dedicated to the environment,

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.390 align:middle line:90%
to social justice, and to peace.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's the greatest
emergence of social action

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing
with "Thrive" is

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:84%
looking to empower self-creating
solutions groups anywhere

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.010 align:middle line:90%
that they want to spring up.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And they are
springing up in cities

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
all across the country,
all across the world.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Where they can address by
sectors-- by education,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:84%
environment, health, and
so forth-- whatever issues

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:84%
are relevant to their
local community.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And also then linking them
together with other cities

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and other organizations
around the world

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:84%
so that people aren't having
to reinvent the wheel.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.940 align:middle line:84%
They can share best
practices, inspire each other,

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.700 align:middle line:84%
join in on petitions,
and so forth.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And it is just
absolutely thrilling

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.459 align:middle line:90%
to see what's going on.

00:28:10.459 --> 00:28:12.583 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: I just want
to say that you can really

00:28:12.583 --> 00:28:14.870 align:middle line:84%
see what happens
because-- like on the GMO

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.280 align:middle line:84%
free zones, for
example, which is

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.540 align:middle line:84%
a hugely successful
movement throughout Italy.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.005 align:middle line:84%
Now Maureen county,
California is GMO free.

00:28:23.005 --> 00:28:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:84%
You know we're going to have
this app out early this summer

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that will allow people to
connect with each other who

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
are engaged so that
all of the-- whatever

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:84%
it is that they did to help make
that happen can just be taken

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
on by other communities
and adapted slightly.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.605 align:middle line:84%
But people don't have to
keep on recreating it,

00:28:39.605 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:90%
as Foster was saying.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And that can happen.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:84%
There can really be model
cities in any number of places

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.480 align:middle line:84%
that will take on
a specific issue

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:90%
and then share that with others.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's important,
as is knowing that just whatever

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.750 align:middle line:84%
your passion is
and your purpose,

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:90%
you can bring that to it.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So that you don't
have to do it all.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.911 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a lot
coming in through Facebook.

00:28:58.911 --> 00:29:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Dave says that there's
a currency that's

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.490 align:middle line:84%
being created in
Ithaca, New York.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Their own currency.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So if people have ideas
of things that they're

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:84%
doing in their own
communities that are working,

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
to create sustainability
within their own communities,

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.530 align:middle line:84%
they can go to this app
and connect and link

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Yeah,
related to that,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
what they call Ithca
Hours which has

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:84%
been a successful
alternative currency.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:84%
The key word, once
again, is voluntary.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.060 align:middle line:84%
If everybody gets to create
whatever currency they want,

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.950 align:middle line:84%
like they did in
Ithaca, then the most

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:84%
successful, trustworthy
ones will surface.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
If people want to create
a currency that's actually

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.960 align:middle line:84%
backed by commodities,
gold or whatever,

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.861 align:middle line:84%
then people are going to
gravitate to those ones rather

00:29:37.861 --> 00:29:39.860 align:middle line:84%
than the ones that are
backed by nothing at all.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the
Ithaca currency?

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it based on trade?

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Yes, it's
local trading of hours.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a time bank.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And the key thing is
that that's really--

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:84%
can be very successful
for a local community.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not great for trading
computers internationally.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.027 align:middle line:84%
But the key is, if people
can create what they want,

00:29:57.027 --> 00:29:58.609 align:middle line:84%
then you're going
to get the ones that

00:29:58.609 --> 00:30:00.675 align:middle line:84%
are appropriate to the
scales and the ones that

00:30:00.675 --> 00:30:01.550 align:middle line:90%
are most trustworthy.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just like
it was meant to be.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: That's why the
whole subsidies and bailouts

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:84%
give a completely false
picture because things

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that don't actually work
end up rising to the top.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So if that's one
of the strategies,

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
large scale is just make
sure that doesn't happen ao

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that something based on
integrity and performance

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.150 align:middle line:90%
is what can rise.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:90%
And really, it is happening.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
We are out now, around, and we
hear from people, literally all

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.802 align:middle line:84%
over the world, describing
different solution strategies

00:30:25.802 --> 00:30:27.885 align:middle line:84%
that they're getting going
in their own community.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And our job, really,
at this stage

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.640 align:middle line:84%
is to just empower those
self-creating movements.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:84%

to do through the website

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: Well
one of things we

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.240 align:middle line:84%
do is we sort of highlight
our top 10 actions.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And just briefly,
one idea is-- I

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:84%
mean, the notion of getting
informed and speaking up

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:90%
is critical.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.717 align:middle line:90%
And its challenging to do that.

00:33:22.717 --> 00:33:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I recommend

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is watching "Thrive" in a
community setting of some sort

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.300 align:middle line:84%
so that you can actually
get a support system going

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.280 align:middle line:90%
for people who are doing.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.550 align:middle line:84%
You can actually take
on the top 10 actions

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.250 align:middle line:90%
together as a community.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.325 align:middle line:84%
You can have friends
to talk to about it

00:33:38.325 --> 00:33:39.950 align:middle line:84%
who are exploring
the same information.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's key.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Banking locally.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.400 align:middle line:84%

this all spread.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.010 align:middle line:84%

that we recommend.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think, it's really
important to find those things

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that most-- you can most
relate to and begin there.

Laura is saying, is
homeschooling my children

a solution?

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
There's someone
else, from Chris.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Chris is basically saying,
are going to farmers markets

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and visiting farmers markets
part of the solutions?

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:39.750 align:middle line:90%
Are those?

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>K. GAMBLE: Absolutely.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.127 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to say
it, homeschooling--

00:36:45.127 --> 00:36:46.835 align:middle line:84%
it takes a community
to do homeschooling.

00:36:46.835 --> 00:36:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a privilege,
and it's something

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that communities need
to organize around.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.146 align:middle line:84%
I had an opportunity
to home school

00:36:54.146 --> 00:36:55.520 align:middle line:84%
some of my kids
some of the time.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:90%
And it was hugely helpful.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.830 align:middle line:90%
So I think, absolutely.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And especially not making
your children wrong

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:84%
if they're not doing well
in a public school setting.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
If they're not sitting
there well, if they're not

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.270 align:middle line:84%
taking the tests well, to really
be careful that you don't have

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.770 align:middle line:84%
them take on the
lack of self-esteem

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that comes from that or the
lack of critical thinking.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.547 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a huge
homeschooling advocate.

00:37:17.547 --> 00:37:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: And I would
say to Chris, absolutely.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled to see the
growth of farmers markets.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And people are catching
on to a lot of the stuff

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that you get in the
old-fashioned stores--

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
or the modern stores with
old-fashioned thinking-- it's

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:90%
not whole food anymore.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.415 align:middle line:84%
It's the pesticides, the
herbicides, the fertilizers,

00:37:35.415 --> 00:37:37.537 align:middle line:90%
it's the GMO, it's the fluoride.

00:37:37.537 --> 00:37:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So more and more
people are going, OK,

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.580 align:middle line:84%
how can I run this
gantlet of toxins

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and actually get clean
water and clean food?

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And farmers markets and non-GMO
actions are part of that.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's all part of
the global world domination--

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.492 align:middle line:90%
is the pesticides and the GMOs.

>>K. GAMBLE: Yes.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
pesticides and fertilizers

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.910 align:middle line:90%
make us oil dependent.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.532 align:middle line:90%

So do you have your own
personal solutions around this?

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.380 align:middle line:84%
What are your concepts,
your theories?

natural, organic food.

Keep chemicals out
of your environment.

There's that whole realm of it.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And then most fundamentally,
on the larger scale,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:84%
the core thing that I have
found in all of this research,

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that the one thing that all
human beings seem to agree to

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't want to be
violated against our will.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this
non-violation principle

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about in the movie
can be, I think, the compass.

I can't overstate
this-- that can

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:84%
allow us to actually
survive as a species

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and then thrive on a healthy
planet if we understand it.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And then begin taking it into
all the areas of our live.

well explained in the film.

Rather than focusing
on punishment,

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.025 align:middle line:84%
instead justice restores
lives and losses.

00:39:43.025 --> 00:39:44.380 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.835 align:middle line:84%
Insurance pays doctors
to keep people healthy.

00:39:46.835 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Education is voluntary,
serving the needs

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.010 align:middle line:84%
of individuals instead
of corporations.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.880 align:middle line:84%
We get honest feedback
from independent media.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.480 align:middle line:84%
There are no subsidies
and no bailouts.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:90%


00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that with an
honest money system, little

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:84%
or no taxes, and low
electric and fuel bills,

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:84%
you would have the money to
pay off your home and car,

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.740 align:middle line:90%
and be free to save and invest.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:20.010 align:middle line:84%
You would enjoy more wealth,
freedom, and security.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.034 align:middle line:84%
All while working the
same or probably less.

about this movie is it gives us

00:40:26.514 --> 00:40:28.090 align:middle line:90%
a vision of a possible future.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
If we don't see it in our
immediate communities,

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.970 align:middle line:84%
we can see it on
a movie like this.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Because you put it
together like this.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:38.762 align:middle line:84%
Does this exist anywhere
that you know of?

00:40:38.762 --> 00:40:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: It exists
in little pockets.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:84%
There are sustainable
communities

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that are growing their
experimental groups that live

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:90%
in houses or on land.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And there are organizations.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.839 align:middle line:84%
There's a Free State Project
going on in New Hampshire

00:40:52.839 --> 00:40:54.380 align:middle line:84%
right now where
people who are really

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.580 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to
non-coercive systems

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.870 align:middle line:84%
are all moving to New
Hampshire by the thousands

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and starting to create
an alternative society.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:07.490 align:middle line:84%
If you live in a family where
people honor each other's

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.352 align:middle line:84%
well being and don't
violate each other.

00:41:09.352 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Don't coerce, don't hit,
and all that kind of stuff--

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.934 align:middle line:84%
you get a taste
of what it can be

00:41:12.934 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:84%
like with the love
and the security

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.155 align:middle line:84%
that's there in a system
where people are not

00:41:18.155 --> 00:41:19.030 align:middle line:90%
violating each other.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.147 align:middle line:90%


00:41:20.147 --> 00:41:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: I think, also,
just this whole notion

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.302 align:middle line:84%
of voluntary and
local communities

00:41:25.302 --> 00:41:26.260 align:middle line:90%
really coming together.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Like Catherine Austin Fitts
has these Solari Circles

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:84%
where somebody who's in
debt with a credit card

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.640 align:middle line:84%
gets together with someone
who has money to invest,

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and the investor pays
off the credit card.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And instead they have a local
dynamic and relationship

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.190 align:middle line:84%
where maybe the credit card is
now a 5% interest rate, which

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is a good rate for someone
with an investment.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like
a local solution

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.120 align:middle line:84%
that they can
participate in in a way

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that you get the big middle
people out of the picture.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Or you can invest in something
in your local community

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, the
Boys And Girls Club.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And when it does well, the
whole community does better.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And you can make money that way.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So there are those
kinds of solutions

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.620 align:middle line:90%
that people are trying.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it might look
like a little thing,

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:12.550 align:middle line:84%
but one of the things about now,
facilitated by Thrive movement

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and other movements-- and
independent media, thank you.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.840 align:middle line:84%
As people become
aware of each other

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and all these best
practices can be shared,

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that we can
access these solutions

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.360 align:middle line:84%
much faster than has
happened in the past.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:30.012 align:middle line:84%
What do we do about the
cell phones, and the email,

00:42:30.012 --> 00:42:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and the passports, and the
tracking, and all of that?

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.631 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that we
can do to empower ourselves

00:42:35.631 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:90%
around that?

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.838 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: I think
grassroots movements

00:42:37.838 --> 00:42:39.912 align:middle line:84%
to do vast
demonstrations, petitions,

00:42:39.912 --> 00:42:40.870 align:middle line:90%
all that kind of thing.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Insist that your political
representatives not

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.840 align:middle line:84%
be in favor of
that kind of stuff.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Or vote them out of office.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, to just simply
withdraw our participation

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.030 align:middle line:84%
from any companies, any
intelligence organizations,

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.311 align:middle line:84%
any governments who are
violating us in that way.

00:42:59.311 --> 00:43:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: And I
want to point out there

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that campaign finance
reform is really

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:84%
a critical prerequisite to any
of these legislative changes.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Because right now the notion of
voting somebody in and having

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.950 align:middle line:84%
them represent you,
it's just not happening.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And it won't happen unless
they're publicly funded

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.234 align:middle line:84%
and unless corporate
person hood stops.

00:43:15.234 --> 00:43:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can make
sure that there's

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.640 align:middle line:84%
paper ballots that are
being counted fairly.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And that your vote is
actually going to count.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And that the person
running does what

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.690 align:middle line:90%
they say they're going to do.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So to me, campaign
finance reform

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.367 align:middle line:84%
is a critical part of any
kind of legislative hope.

00:43:28.367 --> 00:43:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I have to be the
skeptic as well because I'm

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:90%
so much the choir.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I need to see, is that
a possible future?

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that will ever happen?

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: Well,
I think it's either

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:44.146 align:middle line:84%
going to happen through
a more violent revolution

00:43:44.146 --> 00:43:45.520 align:middle line:84%
or it's going to
happen that way.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.353 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to happen
one way or another.

00:43:47.353 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm absolutely convinced.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.720 align:middle line:90%
There's a revolution brewing.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:84%
We're feeling it
all over the place.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:90%

And the Federal
Reserve-- I mean, just

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.960 align:middle line:84%
finding out that it's
a private corporation.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was mind blowing.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: And that
it's a rigged system.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And as people are watching
how difficult it is just

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:05.430 align:middle line:90%
to make it.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And you become aware of the
alternatives that exist.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm confident.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: It's also critical
to realize that we outnumber

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.400 align:middle line:84%
the few people who are actually
perpetrating these covert

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:14.900 align:middle line:90%
agendas--

>>F. GAMBLE: --by
over a million to one.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So as shows like
this wake up people,

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:20.970 align:middle line:84%
and as they do
their own homework

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.980 align:middle line:84%
through an open
internet and so forth,

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.560 align:middle line:84%
then people's creativity
gets unleashed.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And they will
insist, ultimately,

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:30.940 align:middle line:84%

>>F. GAMBLE: We can't
do everything at once.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I envision three
overlapping stages

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.725 align:middle line:90%
of the solutions process.

00:44:55.725 --> 00:44:58.640 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.900 align:middle line:84%
In stage one we bring as
much integrity as possible

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:02.925 align:middle line:90%
to our current systems.

00:45:02.925 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:90%


00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.880 align:middle line:84%
If we cut the US
military budget in half,

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.280 align:middle line:84%
it would still roughly
equal the defense spending

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.835 align:middle line:90%
of the entire rest of the world.

00:45:10.835 --> 00:45:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Between that and getting
rid of the Federal Reserve,

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:84%
over a trillion
dollars a year would

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.880 align:middle line:84%
be freed-- enough to feed
everyone on our planet,

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.685 align:middle line:84%
deal with social issues,
and heal our environment.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Many people believe that
widespread starvation

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:90%
and poverty are inevitable.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But compared to war,
eliminating poverty

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and restoring the
environment are cheap.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:38.020 align:middle line:84%
According to Lester Brown's
Earth Policy Institute,

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.860 align:middle line:84%
it would take under
$200 billion a year

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to restore the
Earth's environment

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.245 align:middle line:90%
and meet global social goals.

00:45:44.245 --> 00:45:46.780 align:middle line:90%


00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But this stage
isn't the end goal

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:49.675 align:middle line:90%
of the liberty perspective.

00:45:49.675 --> 00:45:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.300 align:middle line:84%
While stage one has a
lot of the compassion

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.590 align:middle line:84%
typically associated with
the liberal Democrat agenda,

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.260 align:middle line:84%
stage two reflects
much of the wisdom

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.330 align:middle line:84%
of the traditional,
conservative worldview.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:05.600 align:middle line:84%
In stage two we shrink
government's role to protecting

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.220 align:middle line:84%
individual liberty
and store it in things

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.584 align:middle line:84%
we share in common, like
ecosystems and the airwaves

00:46:11.584 --> 00:46:12.500 align:middle line:90%
we use to communicate.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.820 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.360 align:middle line:84%
As the system gains integrity
and we move to sound currency,

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:84%
people will have
enough money to have

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:24.650 align:middle line:84%
more control over everything
that affects them.

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Stage three grows out of
the increasing freedom

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.390 align:middle line:84%
that people gain in
stages one and two,

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.640 align:middle line:84%
as they have more
money and more time.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.940 align:middle line:90%


00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:84%
There is no involuntary
tax and therefore

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.855 align:middle line:90%
no involuntary governance.

00:46:38.855 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.390 align:middle line:90%
There's no monopoly on force.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.530 align:middle line:90%
There are rules but no rulers.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Rigorously protecting
individual rights

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.846 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be key for
honoring our interdependence.

00:46:50.846 --> 00:46:52.330 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.710 align:middle line:84%
We can be distinct and
unified at the same time.

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.320 align:middle line:84%
As Utopian as this
can sound at first,

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been thrilled to see how
much practical thinking has

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:05.410 align:middle line:84%
been done to deal
with tough issues

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.813 align:middle line:84%
like health care,
crime, and education.

00:47:08.813 --> 00:47:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:13.180 align:middle line:84%
These three stages
validate the best

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.650 align:middle line:84%
of both the liberal and
conservative perspectives

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that have divided us for so
long and then reconcile them

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.870 align:middle line:84%
at a new level
around non-violation,

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.540 align:middle line:90%
a core ethic we all share.

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.690 align:middle line:90%


00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Stage three honors
human incentive

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and finally includes the rights
of not just many, not just

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:35.517 align:middle line:90%
most, but everyone.

00:47:35.517 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is great.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.090 align:middle line:84%
We are getting a lot of
feedback coming back in.

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:41.385 align:middle line:84%
From Sarah, in her
apartment complex,

00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:43.440 align:middle line:84%
says that she's having
regular meetings,

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.390 align:middle line:90%
setting up a recycling program.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.105 align:middle line:84%
We've got Potter here
who says that he's

00:47:48.105 --> 00:47:50.470 align:middle line:84%
going to get his parents
to watch "Thrive".

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:54.376 align:middle line:84%
And then they can share it with
their friends, which is great.

00:47:54.376 --> 00:47:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: I want to
mention something about that

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.294 align:middle line:84%
because we've found a
lot of people sharing

00:47:58.294 --> 00:48:00.210 align:middle line:84%
this cross-generation
and also cross-politics.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.104 align:middle line:84%
Because really this is--
and Foster can talk--

00:48:04.104 --> 00:48:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a global.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>K. GAMBLE: --this more.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But this is really based
on principles not politics.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.090 align:middle line:90%


00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So we found over
Thanksgiving and the holidays

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.910 align:middle line:84%
that people were sharing
this and saying, jeez,

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I finally had a really
good conversation

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:84%
with my uncle who I never
could relate to before.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Or even parents, and
siblings, or whatever it was.

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think cross-generation and
cross-political perspectives--

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:84%
"Thrive" has a lot to offer
to have us actually find out

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.380 align:middle line:84%
what we have in common
and what we need to do.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it brings
communities together.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>K. GAMBLE: Yes, exactly.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: The conversation
is moving to a new level

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.580 align:middle line:84%
beyond you wear a red
shirt or a blue shirt,

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.230 align:middle line:84%
or you're a conservative
or a liberal-- to what's

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:41.640 align:middle line:90%
really going on in the world.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And what can we do it that's
based on principles that we all

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.935 align:middle line:84%
agree to rather than on
who's got the most power

00:48:47.935 --> 00:48:49.546 align:middle line:90%
and who's got the most money.

00:48:49.546 --> 00:48:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're thrilled
with what's going on.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.710 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing in communities
all across the world

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that people are organizing
in Thrive solutions groups,

00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:59.330 align:middle line:90%
on their own.

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're empowering
them with a model

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that we used successfully in
California to stop the Bush

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:08.600 align:middle line:84%
administration from spraying
toxic poisons on 7 million

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.100 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.350 align:middle line:84%
They were going to do
that for up to 10 years.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And we used this
model where people

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:16.980 align:middle line:84%
could come together and identify
what sector their passion

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.000 align:middle line:90%
and skills are in.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So the lawyers did
the justice part.

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists did the
environment or the health.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And we worked on the
follow the money thing

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to find out what
was really going on.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And it created this kind
of laser type coherence

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.350 align:middle line:84%
of activism that
ended up stopping

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.822 align:middle line:90%
that onslaught in six months.

00:49:35.822 --> 00:49:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're sharing this
model now so that people

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.340 align:middle line:84%
can, in their local communities,
not only initiate actions

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:45.015 align:middle line:84%
but find out what's already
going on in terms of GMO,

00:49:45.015 --> 00:49:47.490 align:middle line:84%
or fluoride, or
justice, or whatever.

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And just simply link
those organizations

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.400 align:middle line:84%
together so that the
different sectors are talking

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.220 align:middle line:84%
to each other and
each person can

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.130 align:middle line:84%
relax into the
level of engagement,

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:59.100 align:middle line:84%
either immediate needs,
or systemic change,

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.270 align:middle line:84%
or the consciousness
shift-- the level

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that they're most
excited about and realize

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that their community is
also addressing it all.

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has to do
it all, but it's

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.840 align:middle line:84%
important to have it
all be in communication.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And then linking those with
other cities around the world.

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.077 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
picture of this model

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:15.160 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And this can be found at
the thrivemovement.com.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>K. GAMBLE: Yeah.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's something where
that program was $300 million

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.360 align:middle line:90%
that we stopped in six months.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we used the
Freedom of Information

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:29.490 align:middle line:84%
to subpoena some of the
inside correspondence,

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:32.620 align:middle line:84%
they said we had anticipated
some resistance from Santa

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Cruz, but we didn't know it
would be so well organized.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's really true that
this provides an opportunity

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.830 align:middle line:84%
for-- we wanted to
follow the money.

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.735 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else is really
good at the politics.

00:50:42.735 --> 00:50:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Here is the
model that we were just

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.451 align:middle line:90%
looking up there on the screen.

00:50:45.451 --> 00:50:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: So you can see
the sectors around the outside.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:50.750 align:middle line:84%
For the viewers, pick
which one of those sectors

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:52.040 align:middle line:90%
draws you the most.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And then the levels.

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.380 align:middle line:84%
There's three toruses going
in towards the center.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Are you someone who wants
to be feeding the hungry

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.400 align:middle line:84%
or working on the system, the
political or economic system

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.930 align:middle line:90%
that is having people go hungry?

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:03.971 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want to be
working on the consciousness

00:51:03.971 --> 00:51:07.280 align:middle line:84%
shift from which-- the
worldviews from which

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.470 align:middle line:90%
all of those systems arise?

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So one of our
Facebook questions

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.910 align:middle line:84%
is coming in saying, does
the election really matter?

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.380 align:middle line:84%
If there is a world global
domination happening?

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.660 align:middle line:90%
What is the election mean?

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: Well
I have to be frank

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's pretty much come down
to Obama versus Romney now.

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:27.400 align:middle line:84%
In the research I've
done, they both work

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.240 align:middle line:90%
for the same entities.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in our
film and the website,

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:84%
this follow the
money pyramid, you'll

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.810 align:middle line:84%
realize the President
of the United States

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:38.170 align:middle line:84%
is not the most powerful
person even in this country,

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:39.330 align:middle line:90%
much less in the world.

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:43.700 align:middle line:84%
That's level two with five
levels of banks-- corporations,

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and banks, and international
banks, and secret societies,

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.070 align:middle line:90%
and so forth on top of them.

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular
election, I

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.850 align:middle line:84%
don't think it will
make much difference.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Based on principles, I'm very
enthusiastic about people

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.610 align:middle line:84%
like Dennis Cousinage
and like Ron Paul, who'd

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:01.100 align:middle line:84%
be willing to risk
their lives to speak out

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.150 align:middle line:84%
against the Federal
Reserve and to shut down

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:04.890 align:middle line:90%
these wars of aggression.

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.011 align:middle line:90%


00:52:06.011 --> 00:52:08.510 align:middle line:84%
That's where the conversation
is coming to principles rather

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.875 align:middle line:90%
to politics.

00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:09.916 align:middle line:90%
>>K. GAMBLE: Yeah, right.

00:52:09.916 --> 00:52:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
even the same party.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:14.730 align:middle line:84%
We're obviously not libertarian,
we're not conservative,

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:15.690 align:middle line:90%
we're not progressive.

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:17.737 align:middle line:84%
We're really going for
the principles here.

00:52:17.737 --> 00:52:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well there's
visionary leaders

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- that
you do have on the film

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.200 align:middle line:84%
as well that are
talking about this.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.748 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what they have to say.

00:52:25.748 --> 00:52:27.020 align:middle line:90%

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.853 align:middle line:84%
>>DEEPAK CHOPRA: In
order to heal the world,

00:52:28.853 --> 00:52:31.195 align:middle line:84%
we have to start telling a
different story to ourselves.

00:52:31.195 --> 00:52:35.480 align:middle line:84%
We have to start engaging in
a different story with others.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.509 align:middle line:84%
It's our collective story
that manifests as the world.

00:52:39.509 --> 00:52:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABET SAHTOURIS:
Humanity is now

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:44.700 align:middle line:84%
in a very interesting
evolutionary phase in which we

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:48.010 align:middle line:84%
move from hostile, aggressive
competition-- which

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.010 align:middle line:84%
is the nature of young
species-- into a more

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:54.009 align:middle line:84%
mature mode of
cooperation, collaboration.

00:52:54.009 --> 00:52:55.425 align:middle line:84%
>>AMY GOODMAN:
There's no question

00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:58.690 align:middle line:84%
in this country that
money, that capital,

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:00.910 align:middle line:84%
is being increasingly
concentrated

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:02.500 align:middle line:90%
in the hands of a few.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And those who are so powerful
are concentrating it further.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But there is a force
that's more powerful,

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
power of the people.

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.641 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA MARX HUBBARD: When
we look at the crises now,

00:53:12.641 --> 00:53:15.120 align:middle line:84%
it is so easy to fall
out of love with love.

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.130 align:middle line:84%
It is so easy to get
pessimistic and desperate.

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But from my
perspective, the crisis

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.170 align:middle line:84%
has matured to
the point of being

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:26.670 align:middle line:84%
on the threshold
of mass awakening,

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and that feeling inside
me gives me the vitality

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:36.590 align:middle line:84%
to know that, no
matter how small

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.730 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing looks
to me in the face

00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:42.580 align:middle line:84%
of these huge problems, that
the impulse of evolution

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.460 align:middle line:90%
is not small.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And when it's in everybody
who's waking up, it's huge.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:48.850 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: I love
Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:51.055 align:middle line:90%
She's so great.

00:53:51.055 --> 00:53:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>K. GAMBLE: You know, one
thing I just want to say

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.650 align:middle line:84%
is that the-- in
the course of this,

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:58.330 align:middle line:84%
we found that the people who
are the most informed, in fact,

00:53:58.330 --> 00:53:59.610 align:middle line:90%
are the most hopeful.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And we've really found
that we are increasingly

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.140 align:middle line:84%
hopeful and optimistic
because understanding what's

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.820 align:middle line:84%
in the way of our thriving--
it's like having a disease.

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.096 align:middle line:84%
Once you know the problem
and how it operates,

00:54:10.096 --> 00:54:11.720 align:middle line:84%
then you can have a
chance to solve it.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:14.502 align:middle line:84%
If someone just says
you're sick, good luck.

00:54:14.502 --> 00:54:15.710 align:middle line:90%
And that really is happening.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And that bears into how do I
share this with my children?

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some clips of it.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:23.370 align:middle line:90%
How old are they?

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And stuff.

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But to do it in a
way that's empowering

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.280 align:middle line:84%
for them to understand that
because of understanding this,

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:31.260 align:middle line:84%
then we can go at the
solutions in an effective way.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>F. GAMBLE: As a
teacher of aikido,

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I used to teach my students
the first imperative

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:38.277 align:middle line:84%
is to have an accurate
assessment of your reality.

00:54:38.277 --> 00:54:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't know
what's coming from behind you,

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.350 align:middle line:90%
you're going to pay the price.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's worth
exposing just enough

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.580 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's
really going on.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And then leading the whole
situation into the solutions.

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I said, we
outnumber the perpetrators

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.300 align:middle line:90%
by a million to one.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.540 align:middle line:84%
We're unleashing the
human creativity.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you're wondering
what one person can do,

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:01.580 align:middle line:84%
go to the website,
print out that top 10.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Tack it onto your
refrigerator, and just

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:07.534 align:middle line:84%
start marking off any ones you
believe in and that you can do.

00:55:07.534 --> 00:55:09.075 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Perfect and
like with aikido,

00:55:09.075 --> 00:55:10.640 align:middle line:84%
you could use that
energy as momentum

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.360 align:middle line:84%
to then work towards your
solution, which is great.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:18.010 align:middle line:84%
