00:00:11.104 --> 00:00:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.603 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:15.480 align:middle line:10%
and we are broadcasting
live from downtown

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.900 align:middle line:10%
Denver, Colorado at the
Hay House "I Can Do It!"

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.689 align:middle line:10%
conference.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.980 align:middle line:90%
And let me ask you a questions.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Is this-- you, do you identify
with this-- that you really,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:84%
really want to learn
how to meditate,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:90%
maybe tried to meditate before?

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You want to be less reactive
in stressful situations?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:84%
But you can't just seem to
sit still and empty your mind?

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, it could be
because you just

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.000 align:middle line:84%
haven't found the right
meditation style for you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And according to
my guest, davidji,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:84%
who is a meditation
teacher and has

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
been an apprentice
to Deepak Chopra

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
for nearly a decade
at the Chopra Center,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
he says that not
one size fits all

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.609 align:middle line:84%
where it comes to meditation,
and all you need to do

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
is find the right style
that works for you.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for being
here and enlightening us.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
whole conversation.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.442 align:middle line:84%
So let me just ask you, first
of all, you didn't always

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
start off as a meditation
teacher, right?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.733 align:middle line:84%
You were in corporate
America, and you

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:90%
did the whole corporate world.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: I started
meditating back in college.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And it was a Zen meditation.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:10%
There were 12 of us.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:10%
We were instructed to raise our
hands when we had a thought.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.540 align:middle line:10%
Our Zen master
stood in the corner.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:84%
In his hand he carried
an 18-inch bamboo stick

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:90%
known as a keisaku.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.816 align:middle line:84%
And when we raised our hands,
he would thwack us on the back.

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So I only stayed in that school
of mediation a couple of weeks.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.273 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my gosh.

00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Found myself
lying to my Zen master.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
When you're lying to your Zen
master, it's time to move on.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:10%
So I moved on to Vipassana
and Buddhist meditation, Zen

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:10%
biofeedback, and chakra
meditations, and energy

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:10%
meditations, and mindfulness,
and mantra meditations,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:10%
and chocolate
tasting meditations.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
on, off, on, off, on,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
falling off meditation
more than staying with it.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And then my life got
deeper and deeper

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
into the whole corporate world.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.877 align:middle line:84%
I was a mergers and
acquisitions adviser

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:84%
for quite a while working
in the World Trade

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Center in Tower Two.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And everything in my life
changed pretty much right

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:90%
after 9/11.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I was walking down in SoHo
past a row of cardboard boxes

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:90%
that people were living in.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And a hand reached out, grabbed
my leg, and a face peered up

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.534 align:middle line:84%
and said, "What's gonna
be on your tombstone?"

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a fairly
reflective question.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: So I went home that
night and I said to my wife,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%
I feel so disconnected.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm unfulfilled.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
My relationships really
aren't fulfilling.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing what I want to do.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, Deepak
Chopra is doing a meditation

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
retreat right now
in Oxford, England.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
You should check it out.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:90%
So the next day, I quit my job.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Within a month, I had headed
off to Oxford, hung out

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:90%
with Deepak, meditated.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:90%
He advised me to go to India.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Did my own eat,
pray, love thing,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:90%
without the eating and the love.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And just the praying.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And headed off to India
in search of the guru.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was after
six months in India

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:84%
that I realized
the guru is inside.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was just like this
profound aha moment for me.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Came back home, and
a friend of mine

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.766 align:middle line:84%
said, all you do is sit
around and meditate now.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what
am I supposed to do?

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, you
should teach meditation.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now, basically,
the interview's over,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.472 align:middle line:90%
because we just-- [LAUGHS]

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Thank you so much.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.138 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love you,
thank you, bye.

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:90%
So, now, let me just back up.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.574 align:middle line:84%
Why did you start to meditate
in the first place, though?

00:03:34.574 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You were going through
corporate America

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
realizing what-- I
mean, most people

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:90%
don't go towards meditation.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
They go towards
alcohol or something.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what were you
trying to achieve?

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.318 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Well, I
had touched it before.

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had remembered
that whatever

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
the style of meditation
that I was doing, even if I

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:84%
only stuck with it
a couple of weeks,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.222 align:middle line:84%
it introduced
balance into my life.

00:03:53.222 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it worked for you.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: So there I was,
a master of the universe,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
working 18 hours a day, 7 days
a week, so out of balance.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I had traded in my early morning
meditation for an early morning

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
train ride to the
World Trade Center.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I had traded in my evening
meditation for a double scotch.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And like that, balance
was gone from my life.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
In my mind I knew,
oh, I remember

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:90%
those days of meditating.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:90%
I was balanced.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.041 align:middle line:90%
I was happier.

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were you, when you
were in that corporate job,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and mergers and acqs
are pretty difficult

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and it gets pretty tense, were
you ever feeling discontent,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
that was wrong,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
that there were things
occurring around you didn't feel

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:90%
were right with you?

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I truly felt that my dharma
had been lost in the shuffle,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and that I was working
just to make money.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Which is fine, if that's
what you're trying to do,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.610 align:middle line:90%
work to make money.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.190 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.167 align:middle line:84%
Then you should keep
moving in that direction.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't really
what was in my heart.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:90%
I was working to be fulfilled.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
a giant disconnect

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what's
going on inside me

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and what's going
on outside of me.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
your inner dialogue

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and your outer dialogue don't
match up, it's a lot of work.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.654 align:middle line:84%
And you can get burnt out,
and you can get so depressed.

00:05:13.654 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:90%
And there's so many things--

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sidetracked.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: --that
can pull you down.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.609 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
You're speaking to many that are
going through that experience

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: I think most
people are doing that.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.002 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That are
trying to recover

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
from the recession,
that are trying

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
to make ends meet in a
very unfulfilled job,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
realizing that the things
that they are supporting

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
are harmful to maybe
themselves or the environment

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:90%
or other people.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
how to get out.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And I think pain can
be a very powerful motivator.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I think when you're
really feeling

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
the depths of your
darkness, that's

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.340 align:middle line:84%
enough to get you off
the couch to take a step.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:90%
For some people, it's not.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it was
really, I was like,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'm in
so much pain right now,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:90%
just show me anything else.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that opportunity
to find a new path--

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:90%
I knew what I didn't want.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
I did want, but I

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:90%
knew what wasn't serving me.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did you
say to the company

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
you were working with at the
time when you wanted to quit?

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:90%
What did you say?

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: I said, I
think I'm leaving here.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, every
one of my fellow masters

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
of the universe--
You know, these

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
are people who are
very, very comfortable.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's got an MBA.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a really nice
pedigree or a nice credential.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's making
a beautiful living

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and able to provide
for their families,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:90%
for generations to come.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's working hard.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
end of that, I was

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
perceived as being
absolutely crazy.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Why would anyone
step away from this?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.732 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was the desirable
thing to do at the time.

00:06:47.732 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Right.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it just
wasn't working.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure for most of them, it
still works many years later.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I had
to explore further.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
There was something that I
wasn't feeling or sensing

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
or connecting with, and I
needed to take that step.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you went to
the retreat that Deepak did,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
what was it that made sense
to you there as opposed

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to all the medication
that you had studied?

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Well, I had gone
to the retreat with such

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:84%
a heavy heart, such
a weight on my chest,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.876 align:middle line:84%
so emotionally I
was very, very sad.

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:84%
All my relationships
were struggling.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:84%
They were caustic
and abrasive at best.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Makes sense,
because you were not

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
doing your heart's
fulfillment at the time.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And I was
just trying to do my job

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and get it done with.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I
suddenly had this opportunity

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.070 align:middle line:84%
to connect to
stillness and silence.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It was as if my heart was
this white linen cloth that

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
had been immersed
in black India ink.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But each day of meditating
and hanging out with Deepak,

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I actually was draping that
cloth through a rushing stream.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:90%
And I became a little lighter.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:90%
And I forgave myself.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And I opened my heart to love.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And just within a few days,
I felt as light as a feather,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:90%
after I'd been so heavy.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was somewhat
traumatized by 9/11.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I lost a lot of friends,
and I was no longer

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
in the World Trade
Center during 9/11.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:90%
But you can imagine--

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You left right before.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Yeah, I left
about six months before.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so that experience
is also very shocking.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:84%
It was shocking to
the entire world.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.448 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Right.

00:08:32.448 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:84%
That's got its own list
of different aspects.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.175 align:middle line:84%
But I truly felt
for the first time--

00:08:38.175 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just 9/11-- but
I felt for the first time,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:90%
oh, my heart is so light.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
My spirit really wants to
connect on a deeper level.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And then Deepak
said to me, well,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:90%
you need to check out India.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing there.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK,
I'll go to India.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And I left right
from Oxford, England

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:90%
and headed off to India.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And I searched high
and low and went

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
to find His Holiness
in Dharamsala,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:90%
and he wasn't there then.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
But I cruised all over,
talking to roadside rishis.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I had a-ha moments.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:90%
I had all this wild stuff.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.069 align:middle line:84%
And I was laying in a
hammock in a cashew forest

00:09:14.069 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:84%
in Karala, reading
the Bhagavad Gita,

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:84%
chapter two, verse 48, which
I had read, I don't know,

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:90%
1,000 times.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.385 align:middle line:84%
But this time when I read it,
"yoga-sthah kuru karmani."

00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.315 align:middle line:84%
It's where Krishna
is talking to Arjuna,

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and he's like, establish
yourself in yoga-sthah,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
in the present moment,
in union, in oneness.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
"Kuru"-- then perform--
"karmani"-- action.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, yes, of course.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:90%
The guru rests inside.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.245 align:middle line:84%
The answer to every
question rests inside.

00:09:43.245 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And I had this amazing aha
moment, and raced up to Mumbai,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:90%
flew back home.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.006 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Left.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And I was just
like, I've got it, I've got it!

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:90%
The guru's inside.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:90%
I can stop looking.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I can stop seeking
everything outside of me.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized is, yes,
the answer to every question

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is inside, but only if you quiet
yourself down enough to hear

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.970 align:middle line:84%
those whispers of God, or
the whispers of your heart.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is the
most challenging part,

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.472 align:middle line:90%
for me at least.

00:10:11.472 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: I think
for most people.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Why for most people is that
the most challenging part?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Because we live
here in this modern world where

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
it's [SNAPPING]--
come on, get it done,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're from the
East Coast or the West Coast.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you're from?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: I'm from
Queens originally.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.812 align:middle line:84%
I live in Carlsbad, California,
the sweet spot of the universe.

00:10:31.812 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
there's so similar.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.435 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Yes, exactly.

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Identical.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Carlsbad doesn't
really have culture,

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really
have amazing food,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really have any finance,
doesn't have any fashion,

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.190 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have
sophisticated music.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's got the weather, and
it's got that ocean breeze,

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:90%
and we do.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Our culture is
LEGOLAND and Comic-Con.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.874 align:middle line:84%
So it's a big shift from
East Coast to Carlsbad.

00:10:55.874 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Coming
from Queens though,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
did you ever bring any of
that experience with you

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:90%
into the meditation?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.781 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Of course.

00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: I think we're
all brought up in New York

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
to-- First of all,
that there can only

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
be one winner in
any conversation.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that New
York City certainly

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:90%
is the center of the universe.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I think we would all
acknowledge that.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
I think that there's

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
some amazing
opportunities for us

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we are
such conditioned beings.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:84%
We are all beings of condition
and practicing something

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not
very reflective.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:90%
We're reflexive.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:84%
We're not very purposeful
with our actions.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:90%
We're knee-jerk.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And that really allowed
me, being from Queens

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and seeing that all
around me, and knowing

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.486 align:middle line:84%
that we have 60,000 to
80,000 thoughts a day.

00:11:52.486 --> 00:11:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
Queens you would say,

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.516 align:middle line:84%
or in New York City you would
say, I probably have more.

00:11:57.516 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Just because that's the
vibe of that whole world.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.870 align:middle line:84%
But I do a lot of
work in the city,

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.451 align:middle line:84%
and I do a lot of work in
the corporate world training

00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.454 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of work with the
military and law enforcement.

00:12:10.454 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you say
you work with them,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.685 align:middle line:84%
what is the main thing
that you're there to teach?

00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: I teach people how
to connect to the stillness

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.885 align:middle line:90%
and silence that rests within.

00:12:18.885 --> 00:12:22.214 align:middle line:84%
I teach people to
trust their silence,

00:12:22.214 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:90%
because that's what happens.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:84%
We pull up a light, we can't
even sit there for two seconds

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
without fidgeting around or
texting or doing whatever.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:84%
We're in this
environment where we're

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
taught as we come
out of the womb,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
the doctor who delivers you
whispers it into your ear,

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, here's how it
works, effort and focus.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not working?

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:90%
More effort, more focus.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's still not working?

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:90%
More effort, more focus.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're never taught, trust,
surrender, connect, listen.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
There's this
beautiful line, do you

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
have the patience to wait
until your mud settles?

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Do you have the patience to
wait until you water is clear

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and the right action
arises by itself?

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
No one in New York has that
patience, not inherently.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.125 align:middle line:84%
And no one who's really working
hard and making stuff happen,

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
using their winning
formula has that patience.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is a whole 'nother
conversation coming in.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you just chill for a little
bit and let things unfold?

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this
is the first time

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I've heard this term, crisis
meditation, that you teach.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.115 align:middle line:84%
And first of all,
you don't teach it.

00:13:33.115 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
But tell me what
crisis meditation is.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Well, most of
us are crisis meditators.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But that's similar to being
like a crisis toothbrusher.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
We brush our teeth from
we're five years old

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and they teach us,
OK, brush your teeth.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really
like to do it.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Our parents keep saying, or our
caregivers tell us to do that.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.294 align:middle line:84%
We wet the brush,
we make believe,

00:13:53.294 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and then at a
certain point we go,

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:84%
oh, this helps me keep my
teeth, and I'm used to it now,

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:84%
and my breath is fresher,
and it feels good,

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.615 align:middle line:90%
and we've ritualized it.

00:14:03.615 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:90%
We've created the routine.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, very few people
proactively sit down and do it.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you brushed
your teeth only

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
when the dentist told
you you had a cavity.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Then you would
have not teeth left.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.728 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most
people do with meditation.

00:14:18.728 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I
help people bring

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:84%
some very specific routines
and rituals into their life

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
so they can not meditate when
the crisis suddenly comes.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Because most people,
they're living

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:84%
their lives and everything's
fine, and suddenly crisis,

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and you magically find
spirituality in that moment.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And you could probably, if you
were meditating in advance,

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't even be a crisis.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Since I'm meditating
every single day,

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's going on
about 12 years,

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:84%
twice a day, crises
don't happen to me.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I see things, well,
that's a disappointment,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's an uncertainty,
oh, that's a surprise.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost like it's
coming at me in slow motion.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I teach
law enforcement, I

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
teach the military to
help them step away

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.420 align:middle line:84%
from all that swirl of
60,000 to 80,000 thoughts,

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and trust themselves,
trust out there.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a woo-woo
kind of conversation.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:84%
It's truly slowing yourself
down and connecting

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to who you really are,
not the conditioned layers

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:90%
that are around you.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.267 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's kind of
untraining the mind.

00:15:22.267 --> 00:15:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: It's exactly
untraining the mind.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, because
we are so conditioned

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
to jump on or fix
or focus and do

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
what it is that it
does almost take effort

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:90%
to untrain the mind.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.224 align:middle line:84%
But when you do it,
it's effortless.

00:15:36.224 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Absolutely.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:90%
So it takes a little practice.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:90%
It takes showing up.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk
about the practices,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
because we like to grab
onto concepts in our minds.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Let's make it real.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have
names for these things.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
One of them you call
metta meditation.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.922 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what is metta meditation?

00:15:52.922 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: So let's say you
really angry at somebody.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's say your harboring a
grievance or some resentment.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Metta meditation
is, actually, it's

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:84%
the very, very first step
of Buddhist meditations.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't mean you
have to become a Buddhist.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't mean you
have to pay homage

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:90%
to some deity or god.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
This essentially means--
metta means loving kindness.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're feeling
a little blame-y or finger

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
pointy at somebody.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And I start every day
with a metta meditation.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:90%
And so you breathe in.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's a breathing technique.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Breathing techniques
are so powerful,

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.801 align:middle line:90%
because no equipment necessary.

00:16:26.801 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:90%
We have it all built in.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:10%
And so you slowly breathe
in through your nostril,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:10%
and you allow that breath
to come into you, down

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:10%
into your belly, and you
actually breath in metta.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.100 align:middle line:10%
You breathe in loving
kindness from the universe.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:10%
And when you flow
it back out you

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:10%
flow it back out
to your teachers.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.760 align:middle line:10%
Then you do it
again, one more time.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.505 align:middle line:10%
Breathe it in, fill
your heart with metta,

00:16:47.505 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:10%
loving kindness, universal
unconditional love.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:84%
When you flow it
out, you flow it out

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:90%
to your family and your friends.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
You do that one more
time, breathe it in,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you flow
it out to those

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.849 align:middle line:90%
with whom you have a grievance.

00:17:01.849 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And you don't stop to
think, wait a second,

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:84%
who's this person
and what's going on?

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's the grievance?

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:06.758 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Right.

00:17:06.758 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Just next breath in, you breathe
in that same loving kindness

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and flow it out to every single
sentient being on the planet.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And then with you
last breath in,

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.763 align:middle line:84%
you flow it to every
corner of the galaxy.

00:17:18.763 --> 00:17:20.304 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it gets
larger and larger.

00:17:20.304 --> 00:17:21.262 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Gets larger.

00:17:21.262 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you take all that
love from every single corner

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, and
breathe it in, and then

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:90%
just release it again.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:90%
That could take what?

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:90%
A minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes?

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:90%
However long you'd like.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And who doesn't
feel like they want

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.047 align:middle line:90%
the universe to kiss their soul?

00:17:38.047 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Who doesn't feel good
after something like that?

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: So in
that moment, even

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:84%
if you were just
vindictive or angry,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
at least for those few
moments, you're not anymore.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:84%
That's beautiful, because
there's past hurts or family

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
members you haven't spoken to
because of stupid things that

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we do that.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And we take years
before we speak

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:90%
to people over stupid things.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So this could really help
you take the high road

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:04.942 align:middle line:90%
on that type of situation.

00:18:04.942 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: You don't have to
call them up and forgive them.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to call them
up and beg for forgiveness.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Really all you're doing
is establishing your flow

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:90%
for the day.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And now, is this also
a breathing meditation?

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:84%
There's also breathing
meditation that you teach.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:19.905 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Yes.

00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of the most
beautiful meditations

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:10%
that I teach I call it
16 seconds to bliss.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:10%
But when I'm teaching the
military or law enforcement,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:10%
I call it 16 seconds to clarity.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.795 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes I call it
tactical breathing.

00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
different experience.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.294 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Know your audience.

00:18:35.294 --> 00:18:36.254 align:middle line:90%
Nope, that's fine.

00:18:36.254 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Languaging
is so important with all

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.545 align:middle line:84%
these teachings,
because that's I

00:18:39.545 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
think what turns
so many people off.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.464 align:middle line:84%
If it sounds too woo-woo
or if it sounds like,

00:18:43.464 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
oh no, I'm not going
to connect to that,

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:90%
then they won't show up.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:90%
So here's how it works.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.037 align:middle line:84%
You envision a
current grievance.

00:18:50.037 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't go back to
your childhood traumas.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not therapy.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
But you just really want to like
maybe someone disappointed you

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:90%
this week.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And so you envision
them in your mind's eye.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:90%
You actually see that person.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually even
feel place in your body

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:90%
that's disturbing a little bit.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And then close your eyes
and for four seconds

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:84%
slowly breathe in
through your nostril

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and observe, witness your breath
as it comes into your sinuses

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:84%
through your chest
down into your belly.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you hold it
there for four seconds,

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and then witness it,
observe it, watch it.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you allow it to come
back up, move up your chest,

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
into your throat,
into your sinuses,

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:90%
out through your nostrils.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you watch
it as it dissipates.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:90%
You observe it.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:90%
You witness it.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:84%
In those 16 seconds
you're not in the past,

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
you're not in the future.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:90%
You're fully present.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to
have thoughts and file

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:90%
your breath simultaneously.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe, in second 17 you're
back with all your grievance.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.220 align:middle line:84%
But we just had a
pattern interrupt.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.797 align:middle line:90%
We do it with our iPhones.

00:19:57.797 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:90%
We do it with our laptops.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:90%
We do it with our computers.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:90%
We power them down, reboot.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:90%
We don't reboot ourselves.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.192 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everyone has 16 seconds.

00:20:06.192 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Right.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Even the people who claim,
no no, I'm very, very busy.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't got it.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has it.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And so for those
who-- Oprah has it.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Barack Obama has it.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.324 align:middle line:90%
Richard Branson has it.

00:20:20.324 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:90%
These are famous meditators.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Deepak Chopra has it.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
If they have 16
seconds, so do we.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.545 align:middle line:84%
If I'm teaching a yoga crowd,
I call it 16 seconds to ananda.

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:33.045 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm teaching
law enforcement,

00:20:33.045 --> 00:20:34.990 align:middle line:90%
it's 16 seconds to clarity.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.796 align:middle line:90%
And they love it.

00:20:37.796 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, one of the
things that I noticed

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
here is that it kind of allows
you to distance yourself

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
from a situation that might be
happening and to, as you said,

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
what was the word you said,
to bring it to a place

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
where it doesn't affect you as
easily, that you can actually

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
observe it before
it comes at you.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: When we can view
parts of our life as a witness,

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
then we can truly
experience a disconnection

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:90%
from our emotional turbulence.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:90%
So we're learning here.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:90%
What is the sensory meditation?

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDJI: Well see, the
reason that a lot of people

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.500 align:middle line:10%
don't show up for
meditation is because they

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:10%
think you have to sit in
utpluthih, full lotus.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:10%
Your eyes have to be closed.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:10%
You have to sit in
a certain space.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to repeat the magic
sound over and over again.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't work
for a lot of people.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
There's 8 billion
people on the planet.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:84%
We each have to find our access
point to stillness and silence.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So sensory meditation
allows us to connect

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:90%
to aromas that are around us.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Even a massage is a form
of sensory meditation.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.916 align:middle line:84%
Most of us, we get a massage,
and then we're out cold.

00:21:52.916 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it's like,
are you still massaging me?

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:90%
I just levitated off the table.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we can realize that,
that's a sensory meditation.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:08.755 align:middle line:84%
It's a practice whether
that's just breathing in lilac

00:22:08.755 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
or breathing in
lavender, breathing

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:84%
in something that truly calms
you, such as sandalwood, rose,

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.045 align:middle line:84%
especially for Pittas
in Ayurveda, those who

00:22:19.045 --> 00:22:21.160 align:middle line:84%
are, like, totally
fired up, and fire's

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:90%
coming out of their fingers.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
These types of citrus, rose,
lavender, patchouli even,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
vanilla, sandalwood,
they're very,

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
very grounding and
very, very slowing.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.357 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you can have a
whole meditative experience.

00:22:34.357 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Through smell,
through aromatherapy.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.102 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:37.102 --> 00:22:37.810 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.625 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a
neuroscientist who

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
has done many studies on the
brain and meditation-- Andy

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Newberg.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And he actually can see
the SPECT scan studies

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of different meditations and
how it impacts individual brains

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying
has wonderful validity

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:84%
in the neuroscience
world as well,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.830 align:middle line:90%
because people are different.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.220 align:middle line:90%
We all are different.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And things impact us differently
and reward us differently.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I know someone exactly like
that, who is so enhanced by

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
smells that it puts her in
a totally different place.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.957 align:middle line:90%
So that makes perfect sense.

00:23:13.957 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Some of
us are very visual.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Some of us are very olfactory.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are very kinesthetic
and very tactile related.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those are different
forms of meditation.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: We need to find
the one that works for us.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.228 align:middle line:84%
And so one could
say, oh, you know,

00:23:26.228 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I tried and fell off
the wagon 30 times.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.476 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
you say, smell this.

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And they suddenly
are transported,

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're fully
present, and it works.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's whatever gets
us to the place of presence,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:84%
however it can in
a meditation realm.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And it gets us because that
is such a break for the stress

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
levels in the body and
for the nervous system.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And it enhances immunity,
because it releases

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:84%
all those great
endorphins of those

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.441 align:middle line:84%
feel good chemicals in the body
that really do repair and heal.

00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And there's
so many studies now

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.564 align:middle line:84%
that prove that meditation
changes the physical structure

00:24:01.564 --> 00:24:06.630 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, studies that
show that meditation allows us

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:84%
to bully less and to feel
that we're more connected

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:84%
to each other
through gamma waves

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and through other types of waves
that come into our physiology

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:90%
when we're meditating.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We've now proven
that whole process.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that amazing, that all
these great scientific studies

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.040 align:middle line:84%
have come out around something
that you've been doing

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and that many have been
doing for centuries?

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the scientific
world needs to validate that.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's great, because
it gives our mind something

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:90%
to grab onto.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But yes, it increases--
there's like 14

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:84%
different medical
benefits from meditating,

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
including the release
of the endorphins.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
It reduces cortisol and
the effects of cortisol

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
in the body, increases immunity
and enhances the immune system,

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.837 align:middle line:90%
improves the relationships.

00:24:48.837 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all those wonderful things.

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And that recent
University of Massachusetts

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Mass General study proved
that meditation actually

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.460 align:middle line:84%
changes the physical
structure of your brain.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It increases the gray matter
in your hippocampus, which

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for learning,
memory, spatial orientation.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having that senior
moment, meditation can help.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And we know now that it
shrinks the gray matter

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
in your amygdala, which is your
anger, your fear, your stress

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.630 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's shrink our amygdala.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Increases
tolerance and patience,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:84%
which every parent
needs, everybody needs.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.694 align:middle line:84%
So you are making
meditation practical.

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing
that I really like.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And you come from the
cold corporate world,

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
so you're able to really
talk on that level,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.025 align:middle line:84%
as well, to someone
who's busy in the mind,

00:25:37.025 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
how to bring this
into a practical way,

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
because of the massive health
benefits of it, as well.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And not to mention
the ancient tradition

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient wisdom that
comes in from meditation.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
meditations for people.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone through
metta, breathing, sensory.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.480 align:middle line:84%
What about Heart
Sutra meditation?

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Well, the heart
is a beautiful place.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.100 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways
that we can connect

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:90%
to heart type meditations.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things
that I'll start my day with.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Just like we were doing that
other type of meditation,

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:84%
if we can just breathe into
our heart and feel it expand,

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and then allow it
to just flow out,

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:84%
ultimately our heart
becomes a conduit.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
There's this beautiful
poem by Hafiz.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
"I am the hole in the flute
through which the Christ

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:90%
breath flows."

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.224 align:middle line:84%
So you're not the flute,
you're not Christ,

00:26:34.224 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:90%
you're not the breath.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:90%
You're the hole.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:90%
We are channels of love.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And so just breathing in.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
beautiful Heart Sutra.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It's peace, harmony,
laughter, love.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:10%
And if we can just
close our eyes

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:10%
and then just breathe into our
heart as we silently repeat,

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:10%
peace, harmony, laughter, love--
do that just for a minute.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:10%
Do that for two minutes,
especially when you think,

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:10%
oh, I'm getting angry,
or I'm disappointed,

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:10%
or I'm not feeling
whole right now.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.130 align:middle line:10%
And you can do
that for 30 minutes

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.995 align:middle line:10%
or you can do that
for 15 seconds.

00:27:06.995 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And just by putting
your attention,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.844 align:middle line:84%
it's all about where
attention goes, energy flows.

00:27:10.844 --> 00:27:12.593 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That would
have been great for me.

00:27:12.593 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I was on the trampoline with
my daughter the other day.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was bouncing
around, and I turned around

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to talk to someone,
and she accidentally,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
complete accidentally, did
a cartwheel into my head.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And she kicked me
super hard in the head,

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.760 align:middle line:84%
so much that it took
a chunk of hair out.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this hair
sitting on my jacket,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:90%
and I panicked for a second.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And that moment of ouch,
and I don't want to yell,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.734 align:middle line:84%
because it was
totally an accident,

00:27:39.734 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and she would have never
done that on purpose.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to make her
feel bad, but I was in pain.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I was shocked
because the hair.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:52.617 align:middle line:84%
And so that would've been
a great thing for me to do.

00:27:52.617 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I actually went and I said,
just give me a minute,

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I went and sat in
my car for a second.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.146 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.146 --> 00:28:01.690 align:middle line:90%
The car wasn't far.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But that would have been a
great, practical thing for me

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.779 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Peace,
harmony, laughter, love.

00:28:08.779 --> 00:28:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Peace,
harmony, that would've

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
been a great way for me to
calm down a little faster.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: There's
another technique

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that I would love
to share with you.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It took me a lot longer.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.346 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: It's called
reaching for SODA.

00:28:17.346 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't even drink soda.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.221 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: I don't
drink soda either,

00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:84%
but I reach for SODA
when I find myself

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:84%
in a cartwheel, trampoline,
hair on my jacket moment.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So any time that moment
occurs, and we all

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:35.090 align:middle line:84%
have a moment like that once
in a while, reach for SODA.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:90%
S-- stop.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, just stop
and take a breath in.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:84%
O, the O in SODA--
observe, witness.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, sort of
lift up until it's just

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:90%
you and another child of God.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you may have to go
up to the Empire State Building

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:90%
height.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.423 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you may have
to go up to the moon.

00:28:59.423 --> 00:29:00.529 align:middle line:90%
But just keep going up.

00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can just
hover on the ceiling

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and say, ah, two
children of God.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.100 align:middle line:90%
And D-- detach.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, you need to
create a physical as well

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
as an energetic space between
you and the cartwheeler,

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.959 align:middle line:90%
or whatever that is.

00:29:15.959 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Car accident, whatever.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.576 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Absolutely.

00:29:18.576 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Even if you're reading an email.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So the detach is you just
taking a deep breath in

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:27.830 align:middle line:84%
as you physically
move your body back

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:90%
a little bit from the situation.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.800 align:middle line:90%
So just go [BREATHES IN].

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you're on the
phone, [BREATHES IN].

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:90%
If you're texting.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're typing,
roll your chair back.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.667 align:middle line:84%
But if you're with
someone, just ease

00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:41.750 align:middle line:84%
yourself back a little
bit, take a deep breath in.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:90%
That's the detach part of that.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And then A, awaken.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.640 align:middle line:90%
Awaken to you most divine self.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Awaken to your best version.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.730 align:middle line:84%
You would say, how would
the best version of Lisa

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:90%
respond in this moment?

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:84%
How would the best
version of me respond?

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The best version of
you doesn't bark.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:84%
The best version of you is
loving and leads with love,

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and is magnanimous, and
can handle anything.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
The best version of you is
compassionate and forgives

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:middle line:90%
instantly.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.960 align:middle line:84%
The best version of you
turns the other cheek.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:84%
The best version of you
never needs to be right.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you can go through
that-- and we're human.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So of course, we're going
to try all those things.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But if we can go stop,
observe, detach, awaken,

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.870 align:middle line:84%
it can be less than five
seconds that whole process,

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and it just allows you to
take the emotional charge,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:90%
leave it someplace else.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And now you can respond.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Who loves your
daughter more than you?

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:90%
No one on the planet.

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.520 align:middle line:84%
You could do this when you're
talking to your parents

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.936 align:middle line:84%
and something
triggers you, or you

00:30:40.936 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:84%
have a teenager whose
brain is confused.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in any way,
you could bring this

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:84%
into very practical--
Bosses, work environments,

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:90%
losing money, clients, whatever.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.520 align:middle line:90%
You can bring it in.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Any scenario,
reaching for SODA works.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Reaching for SODA works.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And neither
of us drink it.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:90%
So that's perfect.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:58.306 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm a big
fan of SODA now.

00:30:58.306 --> 00:30:58.991 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:30:58.991 --> 00:30:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Perfect.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.483 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, this is great.

00:31:00.483 --> 00:31:02.070 align:middle line:84%
There was also
something you mentioned

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.390 align:middle line:90%
about a chanting meditation.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.724 align:middle line:84%
And this comes in, of course--
You bring a little bit of fun

00:31:06.724 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:90%
into it, which I like.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.098 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDJI: Well,
a lot people think

00:31:09.098 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:10%
that if you're considering,
oh, maybe I'll go out to a show

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:10%
tonight, or maybe I'll
see some music tonight,

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.220 align:middle line:10%
they see that more as
like a separate thing,

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:10%
maybe because they're
going to drink or party.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.510 align:middle line:10%
But that can be-- we
can go to a concert,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:10%
and whoever our favorite musical
artist is, we can get into it.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:90%
We can connect to that.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we can all
chant the Tryambakam,

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
or we can all
chant some Gayatri,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:84%
but we can also repeat the
words with our favorite singer

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:84%
or performer and
get into that flow.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Can be Johnny Cash
or Loretta Lynn.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, or
The Grateful Dead.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Or Metallica.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.191 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Think about that.

00:31:50.191 --> 00:31:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You could bring in that,
because it brings you back

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:90%
to those great memories.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:90%
And you bring them in.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And what
happens is suddenly, again,

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.040 align:middle line:84%
you're living in
the present moment.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.951 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And so if
you are having issues,

00:32:01.951 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:84%
if you are struggling, if it's
been very, very tough day,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:84%
before you pound
that second shot,

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.620 align:middle line:84%
instead you can just
do your chanting

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.162 align:middle line:84%
with your favorite
performers and get into that.

00:32:12.162 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
going to go to the gig,

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.020 align:middle line:90%
you could do it at home.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
This, all of what
you're talking about,

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.953 align:middle line:90%
makes this world a better place.

00:32:18.953 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:84%
If we could all do
something like this,

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:84%
we could really completely shift
the vibration of this planet,

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:24.821 align:middle line:90%
because people would be nicer.

00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:25.861 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: They would be.

00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Kindness actually does matter.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you
interact with in any given day?

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:84%
From the market, to the
freeway, to the airports,

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:84%
whatever, how beautiful
would this world

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:84%
be if everyone that you
interacted with in a day

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.500 align:middle line:90%
was kind?

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: We need to recognize
the power of our ripple.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:84%
We need to truly know
that, wow, I actually

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:52.940 align:middle line:90%
am impacting the world.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
From the Starbucks barista to
the person sitting in the car

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:90%
next to us to--

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Someone who
hates their job.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.148 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Right.

00:33:01.148 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you just look
at them-- David Simon,

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
one of my great teachers,
used to say this to me.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Whenever he felt I was feeling
less than, then he would say--

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can't do this a
lot with your employees,

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.777 align:middle line:84%
because it may violate or
cross certain boundaries.

00:33:18.777 --> 00:33:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you looked
at someone and said,

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.502 align:middle line:84%
you're beautiful, that's
like the first thing

00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that you could ever
say to someone.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.730 align:middle line:90%
You're doing a great job.

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:90%
And I love you.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Upon hearing that, you will
always crack your heart open.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It never makes anyone feel
worse about themselves.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So if could say that
to-- It's a little tough

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
if it's an employee,
because I don't

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:84%
know if you can tell
employees that you

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:90%
love them or you're beautiful.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.235 align:middle line:84%
But you can certainly
say it to everyone else.

00:33:45.235 --> 00:33:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can certainly
say to employees,

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.780 align:middle line:84%
you're doing a great
job, thank you.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can say it in your
mind too, with the energy.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Sending Namaste
to people is so powerful.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going
to take a look here

00:33:55.625 --> 00:33:56.981 align:middle line:90%
at a video of davidji in action.

00:33:56.981 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:05.820 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDJI: Being human on
planet Earth can be challenging.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.540 align:middle line:10%
It's tough out there.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:10%
The elements can be brutal.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:10%
The stresses of nature can
threaten our very existence.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.889 align:middle line:10%
The unknown,
uncertain, unexplained,

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:10%
and relentless aspects of
life can confuse us, scare us,

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.460 align:middle line:10%
and overwhelm us.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.730 align:middle line:10%
Through the ages,
people have reached out

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.699 align:middle line:10%
to the timeless
wisdom traditions

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:38.570 align:middle line:10%
to receive clarity,
calm, and insight.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:10%
The ancient masters
held the keys

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.860 align:middle line:10%
to peace of mind, deeper
understanding, and the answers

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.789 align:middle line:10%
to our most profound questions.

00:34:46.789 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:10%


00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:54.000 align:middle line:10%
But these days, life is more
intense and complicated.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:10%
The pressures, deadlines,
and stresses of every day

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:02.630 align:middle line:10%
have separated us from clarity
of thought, peace of mind,

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.890 align:middle line:10%
and daily balance.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:10%
I worked in the corporate
swirl for 20 years,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't have the tools to
be the calm amidst the chaos.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:17.070 align:middle line:10%
In the wake of 9/11, I left that
world and set out on a journey

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.920 align:middle line:10%
to uncover the timeless
secrets of inner piece

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.180 align:middle line:10%
and personal transformation.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:10%


00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.160 align:middle line:10%
I met world-renowned teacher,
author, and spiritual adviser

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:29.915 align:middle line:10%
Deepak Chopra.

00:35:29.915 --> 00:35:32.720 align:middle line:10%


00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:10%
For 10 years, I travel
the world with him,

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:10%
sat at the feet of the masters,
studied the ancient texts,

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.490 align:middle line:10%
and began sharing these
timeless tools and techniques

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:10%
with thousands
throughout the world.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:52.110 align:middle line:10%
And now, I'm sharing
them with you,

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:57.078 align:middle line:10%
so you can more fully enjoy
what matters most in life.

00:35:57.078 --> 00:36:41.990 align:middle line:90%


00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.230 align:middle line:10%
My story of transformation
is your story.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:10%
Your struggles have
been my struggles.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:10%
Your challenges have been mine.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:10%
And now these timeless
secrets are ours.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:10.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So now that we
understand that there

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.790 align:middle line:84%
are various types of
meditations that really work

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.100 align:middle line:84%
for us, that we can
make them practical,

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm really interested in what
you talked about in terms

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:25.060 align:middle line:84%
of sound and meditation
through sound.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Can different types
of music really elicit

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.680 align:middle line:84%
that type of feeling
that you really

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:84%
get from a chanting meditation
or, what you mentioned,

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.154 align:middle line:90%
Kamasutra meditation?

00:37:38.154 --> 00:37:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: It's really
a great question,

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:84%
because we figure we're in
the womb for nine months,

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and so we're hearing that
drumbeat of our mother's heart

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.740 align:middle line:90%
for nine months, constantly.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, that's a very
comforting and grounding

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.632 align:middle line:90%
environment for us.

00:37:53.632 --> 00:37:55.673 align:middle line:84%
Then we come back out into
the rest of the world,

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:58.150 align:middle line:84%
where there's all this other
crazy, kooky stuff, noises

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that don't necessarily
nourish us.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when we can
get the opportunity

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to connect to music,
connect to a beat,

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:84%
connect to a flow
of sound waves--

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Sound healing is one of the
most powerful present moment--

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.120 align:middle line:84%
because it takes us
into the present moment.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It takes us away from
every other thing that

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:84%
could be bothering us, or
scaring us, or making the sad,

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.780 align:middle line:90%
and brings us back to the womb.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Imagine when
we were in the womb.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.796 align:middle line:90%
You're immersed in water.

00:38:27.796 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been
in a swimming pool,

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and you hear music from
underneath the swimming pool,

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's like a dullened
sound, but you really

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:90%
get the vibration of it.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.786 align:middle line:84%
It probably goes through
the water to you.

00:38:40.786 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's exactly
what we felt like.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: We're used to hearing
things just through our ears,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.400 align:middle line:84%
not really aware that the
vibrations are touching

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.100 align:middle line:84%
every single cell
in our physiology.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So you created something
called-- what is it,

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.014 align:middle line:90%
Ayurvedic opera?

00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Yeah.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.610 align:middle line:84%
About a year ago I wrote
an Ayurvedic opera.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: So
Ayurveda acknowledges

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that the mahabhutas, the five
master elements-- space, air,

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:05.580 align:middle line:84%
fire, water, and earth--
are flowing outside of us

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.410 align:middle line:90%
in a most universal context.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're flowing
into us as well.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So space is all about
infinite possibilities.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Air is all about
movement and change.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Fire is all about
transformation.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Water is about nourishment.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:90%
And earth is about stability.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote this opera, sort of
like a spiritual song cycle,

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.680 align:middle line:84%
about weaving those five
elements through this process.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And Ayurveda's the
5,000-year-old science

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.920 align:middle line:90%
of healing.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I connected with
sound healers, Sacred Fire,

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.240 align:middle line:90%
they're a Canadian group.

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And we took my
libretto and turned it

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:46.290 align:middle line:84%
into this really amazing
healing mantras and music

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.484 align:middle line:90%
and meditations.

00:39:48.484 --> 00:39:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're
a musician also.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Just to a
very, very small extent.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I would never say that
to real musicians.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.721 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we could
take a look at this.

00:39:55.721 --> 00:39:56.710 align:middle line:90%
We'll be the judge.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.626 align:middle line:84%
In this video, take a look
at this Ayurvedic opera.

00:39:59.626 --> 00:40:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: It's called
"Journey to Infinity."

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.848 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sounds cool.

00:40:02.848 --> 00:40:04.342 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:40:04.342 --> 00:40:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Journey to infinity
is a profound experience.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like channeling the divine.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.737 align:middle line:90%
Emotionally, it's cathartic.

00:40:12.737 --> 00:40:14.198 align:middle line:90%
It's healing.

00:40:14.198 --> 00:40:16.146 align:middle line:90%
It's nourishing.

00:40:16.146 --> 00:40:19.270 align:middle line:84%

The fire tracks
are inspirational.

The earth tracks are grounding.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.795 align:middle line:90%
They'll center you.

00:41:26.795 --> 00:41:31.414 align:middle line:84%
They'll allow you to connect

The space tracks, they
flow pure potentiality.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:84%
They're pregnant
with possibilities,

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.756 align:middle line:84%
and we can actually
awaken that within us

00:42:11.756 --> 00:42:15.370 align:middle line:90%
when we listen to those tracks.

00:42:50.458 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel the air?

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.990 align:middle line:90%
That wisp is thought.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.055 align:middle line:84%
And the air tracks are all
about creativity and flowing

00:43:02.055 --> 00:43:04.360 align:middle line:90%
your creativity.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So one listen to
"Journey to Infinity"

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have taught
about the myths of meditation.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.242 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the myths
around the meditation?

00:43:20.242 --> 00:43:22.033 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: That's really
one of the reasons

00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:23.840 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote Secrets
of Meditation,

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:84%
because I felt that so many
people stopped meditating

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:84%
or didn't meditate because
they had a misconception.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I really had
gone on this journey

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.440 align:middle line:84%
to demystify all of the
myths that prevent people

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:84%
from accessing the
stillness that rests within.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:42.406 align:middle line:90%
So myth number one.

00:43:42.406 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:84%
What we probably all
learned about meditation

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.840 align:middle line:84%
by watching David Carradine
on "Kung Fu" with Kwai Chang

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and Grasshopper.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Or we watch Jim Carrey
levitate in the jungle

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:52.360 align:middle line:90%
with the guano and the monkey.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Or we read something about it.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But all of those teachings would
say, oh, you want to meditate?

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, first stop your thoughts
and clear your mind.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.019 align:middle line:90%
As if.

00:44:04.019 --> 00:44:05.060 align:middle line:90%
That's not even possible.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.685 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what that even means.

00:44:06.685 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:90%
What do you clear the mind with?

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:08.969 align:middle line:90%
The mind clearer?

00:44:08.969 --> 00:44:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
another one, and then you

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.610 align:middle line:90%
have to clear that.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And so suddenly there's all
these mind clearers stacked up.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't clear the mind
and we can't stop thoughts.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, consciousness-based
teachings

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.770 align:middle line:90%
never tell you to stop this.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.510 align:middle line:84%
They just tell
you to drift here.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And by drifting here, this
doesn't really exist anymore.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.612 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why 16 seconds
to bliss actually works.

00:44:34.612 --> 00:44:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all these
other techniques where

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.740 align:middle line:84%
we drift our attention
to here suddenly work,

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's not about
stopping anything else.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is so
relieving, because I

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.050 align:middle line:90%
have a busy mind over here.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really
know how to do that.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: So you're
probably meditating,

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're making lists, and
you're feeling like a loser,

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:53.140 align:middle line:90%
and you're like--

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I sit down to meditate,
and then I have a thought,

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.069 align:middle line:84%
and then I get distracted
by that thought,

00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and I forgot that I
was going to meditate.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Three
hours later, you're

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.790 align:middle line:84%
journaling and doing
all this other stuff.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.427 align:middle line:90%
That's most people.

00:45:04.427 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to give
ourselves permission.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.450 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to
clear our thoughts.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying
to clear the mind.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.070 align:middle line:90%
We can't stop them.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:13.890 align:middle line:90%
There's one every 1.2 seconds.

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are cool.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.676 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are ridiculous.

00:45:16.676 --> 00:45:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are gibberish.

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Some of them mean nothing.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:21.080 align:middle line:90%
But they're coming.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we can bring our attention
to our breath or to a mantra

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:27.960 align:middle line:84%
or to music or to
something else, whatever

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that object of our
attention is, that's

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.670 align:middle line:84%
one of the secrets
of meditation.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Just find an object of your
attention, an aroma, a candle,

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.280 align:middle line:90%
tasting a chocolate truffle.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Repeating Aham
Brahmasmi or some type

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.420 align:middle line:84%
of mantra, a personal
mantra, over and over,

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.850 align:middle line:84%
using an affirmation--
any of those things

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.450 align:middle line:84%
can allow you to create
an object of attention.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you'll find
yourself in thought.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can say, oh, I'm
not going to scold myself.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm having a thought.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll gently drift back
to the object of my attention.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And so if that's
your breath, that's

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.657 align:middle line:84%
really what mindfulness
is all about.

00:46:05.657 --> 00:46:06.740 align:middle line:90%
It's taking in everything.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:07.956 align:middle line:90%
Sounds aren't distractions.

00:46:07.956 --> 00:46:09.580 align:middle line:84%
They're are all part
of the meditation.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So a major
myth is that you

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.609 align:middle line:84%
don't have to clear
your thoughts.

00:46:12.609 --> 00:46:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Exactly.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just focus on
what it is that you want.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Give me another myth.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.159 align:middle line:90%
That was a good one.

00:46:20.159 --> 00:46:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: What's another myth?

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Another myth is that-- and this
is a fairly important one--

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:30.080 align:middle line:84%
if I meditate, I'm a superior
being or I'm enlightened.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't meditate to
become superior beings.

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:34.210 align:middle line:90%
It's all Namaste.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:36.820 align:middle line:84%
We're neither above
nor below anyone.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And meditation actually doesn't
stop us from being a jerk.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But it might make us
after the fact go, whoa,

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't really want
to behave that way.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:52.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to act that way.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you may go
back and apologize.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So His Holiness the Dalai
Lama loses his temper.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.840 align:middle line:84%
The people we find as
the most spiritual beings

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.670 align:middle line:84%
on the planet
misspeak or mis-act.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:06.710 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual journey allows
us to take a step back and say,

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's not really
how I wanted to show up.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll go
back and apologize.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll change
the trajectory.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So the myth is, oh, if
I do this, I'm perfect.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.690 align:middle line:84%
You're human, and you'll
always be human, hopefully.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.148 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Gives you a chance to
reflect on who you are really

00:47:22.148 --> 00:47:24.640 align:middle line:84%
being, and how you react
in certain situations.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Yes.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.388 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mentioned
earlier that Barack Obama

00:47:27.388 --> 00:47:28.050 align:middle line:90%
is a meditator.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Well, I don't
know that he calls it that.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.470 align:middle line:90%
He's a fairly religious guy.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And he likes to hang out
with spiritual advisers,

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.680 align:middle line:90%
his spiritual advisers.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I know he's friends with
Deepak Chopra, as well.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And during the debates between
Barack Obama and Mitt Romney,

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.680 align:middle line:84%
my book got woven
into the White House.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.280 align:middle line:90%
It may be a coaster there.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.600 align:middle line:90%
But it got woven in there.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And he's very reflective.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I bet that he does
some meditation techniques.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.470 align:middle line:84%
We can see, he's not
necessarily reactive.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.450 align:middle line:90%
He takes a step back.

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And I like to say if
prayer is talking to God,

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.542 align:middle line:90%
meditation is listening.

00:48:16.542 --> 00:48:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:19.624 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: So if we can
quiet ourselves down,

00:48:19.624 --> 00:48:21.539 align:middle line:84%
we can actually
hear God responding.

00:48:21.539 --> 00:48:23.080 align:middle line:84%
We can hear the
whispers of our heart

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.230 align:middle line:84%
if we believe in the universe,
as opposed to something else.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well I do I really
appreciate the ways that you

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:32.650 align:middle line:84%
make meditation
practical for everyone.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's caught the
attention of media.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And you obviously see it
circling different circles

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that we would never
even have thought about.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you teach
children meditation?

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: One of the
most beautiful things

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that I get to do is I teach
at schools once in a while.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't even use
the word meditation.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I call it ocean breathing.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:01.514 align:middle line:84%
So we're all familiar with
like Ujjayi breathing.

00:49:01.514 --> 00:49:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't know
how to do Ujjayi breathing,

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.360 align:middle line:90%
it's a yogic form of breathing.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But you make believe
your hand is a mirror

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and you go [EXHALES HOARSELY]
and fog the mirror.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And now you close your
mouth, and now you

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.580 align:middle line:84%
breathe through your
nose, and you essentially

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.520 align:middle line:84%
make that same sound,
almost like your throat

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.170 align:middle line:90%
was the mirror.

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's like--
[SLOW, HOARSE BREATHING]

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:32.294 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can really feel
that inside of your throat.

00:49:32.294 --> 00:49:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: If you
close your eyes,

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:35.251 align:middle line:84%
it's exactly what
it sounds like when

00:49:35.251 --> 00:49:36.860 align:middle line:84%
you're scuba diving
or snorkeling.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So for kids, we call
it ocean breathing.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And so kids close their eyes.

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course we
say, again, it's

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.840 align:middle line:84%
secretly focusing
on your breath.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Witness your breath.

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And as they put all that
attention, they're not here,

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:51.460 align:middle line:90%
they're not there.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.070 align:middle line:90%
It works with 5-year-olds.

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It works with 15-year-olds,
because it's cool.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
start to do that--

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:02.575 align:middle line:84%
One of my students
is Ariana Grande.

00:50:02.575 --> 00:50:04.872 align:middle line:84%
She's one of the most amazing
vocalists on the planet.

00:50:04.872 --> 00:50:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Her voice is amazing.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.455 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: So
isn't it refreshing

00:50:07.455 --> 00:50:10.180 align:middle line:84%
that someone like that, who's
got all the potential things

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.699 align:middle line:84%
pulling her in a
million directions.

00:50:11.699 --> 00:50:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She's a teenager.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: She's meditating.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that allows
her to not get

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.850 align:middle line:90%
distracted by all the things.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:23.459 align:middle line:84%
And that's why she actually
acts who she is inside.

00:50:23.459 --> 00:50:24.750 align:middle line:90%
There's a certain authenticity.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can tell.

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.117 align:middle line:84%
I saw her perform once,
where all of the electronics

00:50:29.117 --> 00:50:30.700 align:middle line:84%
broke down, her
microphone broke down.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And she was smooth,
completely effortless.

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:35.690 align:middle line:90%
She just flowed right into it.

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The performer before her, same
technical issues happened,

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.570 align:middle line:90%
she stormed off stage.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.430 align:middle line:90%
And that makes a lot of sense.

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:46.320 align:middle line:84%
That's a great example of
seeing how it can actually

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.080 align:middle line:84%
allow you to roll with
the punches even more.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is such
a perfect example

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:52.690 align:middle line:90%
of why meditation works.

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:54.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
to the mountaintop.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.650 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to wear orange.

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.690 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
get to a place where

00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:59.760 align:middle line:84%
it helps you in
your practical life.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to pick up on
something you said, a client.

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:05.460 align:middle line:84%
You have clients that
you help meditate?

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.069 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Well, mostly
I work with groups.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I work with SEAL teams, and
I work with special forces,

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:17.000 align:middle line:90%
and I work with companies.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But every once in a while
someone says, listen,

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.610 align:middle line:90%
this is so important to me.

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:22.960 align:middle line:90%
I want to lock it down.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I want to get my mantra.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to flow this
through my business, my family,

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.280 align:middle line:90%
my whatever.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times
I'm like, well, just

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.990 align:middle line:84%
come to one of my
workshops or become

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:90%
one of my certified instructors.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.707 align:middle line:84%
So I do teacher trainings,
and I teach people.

00:51:37.707 --> 00:51:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Masters of
Wisdom and Meditation Teacher

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Training.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.256 align:middle line:84%
And every once in
a while, someone

00:51:42.256 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:84%
says-- there's like
love a connection,

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.350 align:middle line:84%
just like we have here,
where someone says,

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:48.520 align:middle line:90%
help me with this process.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So every once in a
while, we stumble

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.210 align:middle line:84%
into a beautiful
meditation relationship,

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:56.880 align:middle line:84%
where I teach them pretty
much all my techniques,

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and then we figure out
what works with them.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Then they keep it
flowing in their lives.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And so many of my teachers
don't actually teach others.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.382 align:middle line:90%
They teach it to themselves.

00:52:07.382 --> 00:52:08.840 align:middle line:84%
You really want to
learn something?

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Learn to teach it.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Do people call you to say that
they're really upset, something

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.610 align:middle line:84%
happened that was
horrific, they really help?

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even a grieving
process or something.

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you help them get through
crises in their lives?

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Sometimes I do.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather teach
people all the tools

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.010 align:middle line:90%
than give them the answer.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I get maybe 50 emails
a day by people saying,

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.450 align:middle line:90%
should dump my loser spouse?

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the best person
to answer that question.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But I can teach them the tools
so that they can actually

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:45.490 align:middle line:84%
make that decision more
deeply inside and make

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:46.572 align:middle line:90%
a more conscious choice.

00:52:46.572 --> 00:52:47.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I teach.

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:49.799 align:middle line:84%
I teach people to
make better decisions.

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter to me
what that decision is,

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:52.967 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want
to convince them

00:52:52.967 --> 00:52:55.300 align:middle line:84%
whether they should open a
business or close of business

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:59.520 align:middle line:84%
or move out of town or get
divorced or start something.

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But I can teach them the
tools so that they'll

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.850 align:middle line:84%
make the most conscious
choice in that.

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
tools that you teach

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:07.500 align:middle line:84%
help people make
better decisions?

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Yes.

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because?

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: Because they're not
coming from a reactive space.

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:14.170 align:middle line:84%
They actually are
being able to come

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:18.590 align:middle line:84%
from that most genuine space,
which is not conditioned.

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To think things through,
and to not regret what you do.

00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:25.549 align:middle line:84%
It does require reflectiveness
and stillness, observation,

00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:27.090 align:middle line:84%
all the things that
you talked about.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:28.756 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: It goes
back to that ancient,

00:53:28.756 --> 00:53:31.340 align:middle line:84%
2000-year-old statement,
"yoga-sthah kuru karmani."

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.250 align:middle line:84%
If we can come from
a place of stillness

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:37.550 align:middle line:84%
as we make a decision,
we'll make better decisions.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:41.210 align:middle line:84%
If you see athletes when
the crowd is going crazy,

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:45.764 align:middle line:84%
someone like LeBron James, on
the line, shooting a foul shot.

00:53:45.764 --> 00:53:47.930 align:middle line:84%
When you see some of these
quarterbacks in football,

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.513 align:middle line:84%
and they're right
about to take it in,

00:53:49.513 --> 00:53:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and 60,000 people
are going crazy,

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's going crazy, they
are the calm amidst the chaos.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They are.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.530 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And they're going
to make the best move, the best

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.420 align:middle line:84%
choice, the best
decision from that.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're in the zone.

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: They're in the zone.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
zone is what you

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:05.170 align:middle line:90%
can recreate through meditation.

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:05.525 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Absolutely.

00:54:05.525 --> 00:54:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That you
teach how to do that.

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:08.211 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: And you're
seeing it more.

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The Super Bowl champs,
the Seattle Seahawks,

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:12.430 align:middle line:84%
they all started doing
yoga and meditation.

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: And they won.

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:16.829 align:middle line:84%
I know we're in
Denver right now.

00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right over
there, they played that.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDJI: It's not a
very popular conversation.

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure after
that, we'll suddenly

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:27.880 align:middle line:84%
see more and more teams saying,
well, I want that edge as well.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.920 align:middle line:90%
I want to do that.

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the LA
Lakers under Phil Jackson,

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.180 align:middle line:84%
he introduced meditation
to all of them.

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:37.630 align:middle line:84%
He's got a bunch of
rings on his fingers.

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:38.884 align:middle line:90%
So we know that it works.

00:54:38.884 --> 00:54:40.425 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
popularizing meditation.

00:54:40.425 --> 00:54:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: It is.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.156 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I did not
know that unless someone

00:54:43.156 --> 00:54:44.230 align:middle line:90%
like you would tell us.

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:47.515 align:middle line:84%
Because I kind of see that
you walk both worlds here.

00:54:47.515 --> 00:54:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Yes.

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share
it with everyone.

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're a
heavy metal headbanger

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.510 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're an athlete,
whether you're a business

00:54:56.510 --> 00:55:00.096 align:middle line:84%
person, whether you're a
nanny, whether you're just

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:03.600 align:middle line:84%
a stay-at-home mom, regardless
of where you are in life,

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.010 align:middle line:84%
you can weave this
into your life

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.581 align:middle line:84%
to take your life
to the next level.

00:55:07.581 --> 00:55:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So now you mentioned Navy
SEALs, and you mentioned a lot

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.580 align:middle line:90%
about the military.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.897 align:middle line:84%
Are these going into any other
different types of practices?

00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Are you just teaching
them meditation,

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.477 align:middle line:84%
or do you teach them how
to view into other realms?

00:55:21.477 --> 00:55:22.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you do remote viewing at all?

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: It's funny.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I work with the
Department of Justice

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and their Blue Courage
initiative, which

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:31.170 align:middle line:84%
is helping restore
nobility to policing.

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.781 align:middle line:84%
And so I just
finished a retreat out

00:55:33.781 --> 00:55:37.500 align:middle line:84%
in Carlsbad at my
mini retreat center.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.840 align:middle line:90%
And there were 19 cops.

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And we studied
Buddhist philosophies.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:46.240 align:middle line:84%
We studied the
five remembrances.

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.100 align:middle line:90%
We studied Patanjali.

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And we studied
eight limbs of yoga.

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.137 align:middle line:84%
We studied a lot of
different things.

00:55:52.137 --> 00:55:54.220 align:middle line:10%
And I've been working with
them now for two years,

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:56.090 align:middle line:10%
so they're very, very open.

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:58.390 align:middle line:10%
But we started with
tactical breathing.

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:01.830 align:middle line:10%
And now we're talking
about teachings

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.010 align:middle line:10%
that we know make them better.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:10.870 align:middle line:10%
So just looking at the--
some basic Buddhist tenets.

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to convince
them to become Buddhists,

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:16.800 align:middle line:84%
but I'm trying to show them
these teachings have existed

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.350 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of
years, and they work.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So maybe connecting to
these ancient teachings,

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.720 align:middle line:90%
this ancient wisdom.

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.620 align:middle line:90%
And they love it.

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.350 align:middle line:90%
They were practicing Ayurveda.

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So if they're a Pitta,
they're cooling themselves.

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:33.886 align:middle line:84%
And if they're a Vata,
they're grounding themselves.

00:56:33.886 --> 00:56:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And so these types
of ancient teachings

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:38.400 align:middle line:84%
are now being flowed
into their lives.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Not to convert them, but just so
they can truly have awareness.

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And the more aware we all are,
the better decisions we make.

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:45.141 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:56:45.141 --> 00:56:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We can make better decisions
and be more patient as well.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, if you could
teach this to everyone,

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.907 align:middle line:90%
then you create a kinder world.

00:56:52.907 --> 00:56:54.365 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so
much for everything

00:56:54.365 --> 00:56:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that you've contributed in
this conversation, of really

00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:01.150 align:middle line:84%
bridging the gap between
the idea of myths

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:04.410 align:middle line:84%
around meditation, and
actually making it practical.

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.284 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDJI: Thank you, Lisa.

00:57:06.284 --> 00:57:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Great stuff.

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:10.030 align:middle line:84%
