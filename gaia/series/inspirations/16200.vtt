00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.850 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:10%
coming to you live from Boulder,
Colorado at the Gaiam Studios

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:10%
And since this is a
live, interactive show,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:10%
I encourage you
to connect with us

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:10%
and communicate with us
through Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:10%
Many of you have already done
that, so thank you so much.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.248 align:middle line:10%
And keep the comments
and questions

00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:10%
coming throughout the show.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you a question.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you find it hard
to make changes?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you keep doing the same
things over and over again

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that bother you, but
then you know better,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.697 align:middle line:90%
and you keep doing it anyway?

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you find yourself
in that position?

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, today we're going to talk
about how the brain evolves

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and how to actually make
changes in the brain,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
so we can break some
of these old patterns,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and better yet, create new ones.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is
Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:90%
He's a neuroscientist.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
He's an expert on brain
functionality and brain

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:90%
chemistry.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.160 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of
the book, "Breaking

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
the Habit of Being
Yourself," and get this,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I love this subtitle--

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
"How to Lose Your Mind
and Create a New One."

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.723 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:13.723 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining me.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely great book.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:90%
And this is your latest release.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit about the book?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.852 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well the second
book, "Breaking the Habit,"

00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:84%
really was an opportunity for
me to contribute to people

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:90%
that wanted to really know how.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a time in
history where people just

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.320 align:middle line:10%
don't want to know, but
they want to know how.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:10%
So the premise of the
book really is simple.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:10%
It says your personality
creates your personal reality.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:10%
And your personality is made up
of how you think, how you act,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:10%
and how you feel.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So the present personality
sitting here today

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
has created the present personal
reality called your life, which

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
also means that if you wanted to
create a new personal reality,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
then on a fundamental
level, you would have

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
to change some thoughts,
begin to behave differently,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and begin to live by
different emotions.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think the biggest
problem with all of us

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
is that we try to create
a new personal reality

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.178 align:middle line:84%
as the same personality,
and it never works.

00:02:10.178 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you said, the way
to change that personality

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.595 align:middle line:90%
is to change your thoughts.

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Easier said than
done, and it's not just

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:90%
about the thoughts.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to change your
entire physiology around it,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Absolutely.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.413 align:middle line:84%
So the key element to
change is to be greater

00:02:25.413 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
than your environment, to
be greater than your body,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:90%
and to be greater than time.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And when we get about
the business of change,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
we're always interacting
with the same people,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and doing the same things,
and going to the same places.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.212 align:middle line:84%
And it's the environment,
our external world

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that's controlling
how we think and feel.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.087 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Our patterns, right?

00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The moment we
begin to react in the same way

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
to the same conditions
in our life,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
then we begin to cause
different circuits in our brain

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
to turn on, equal to everything
that we know in our life.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And that repetition
over time begins

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to hard wire our
brain to everything

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:90%
familiar in our life.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.813 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So give me
an example of that.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, you
wake up in the morning.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:90%
You go to work the same way.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.625 align:middle line:84%
You see the same
people, that push

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:90%
the same emotional buttons.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
You get at your desk
and you do the things

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:90%
that you know how to do so well.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:84%
You drink coffee out
of your favorite mug.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:84%
You complain to the same
people in the same way, that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:90%
stir up the same emotions.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:84%
You see the same people that
push the same emotional buttons

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, in time, we could say
that the environment, really,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
is shaping and molding
how we think and feel.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So to change then is to be
greater than the environment,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:84%
to begin to act, and
think, and feel differently

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:90%
than our present circumstances.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So it doesn't work
that you even just change

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:10%
your routine, because you
will automatically set it up

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.323 align:middle line:10%
to create the same
type of circumstances

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:10%
with a whole different
routine-- if you change jobs,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:10%
if you take your child to
school, or whatever it is.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's a concept
in neuroscience

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:90%
called neuroplasticity.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And plasticity
tells us that we're

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
changed by every
thought we think,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
every new experience we have,
every different choice we make,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
every new dream
that we fabricate.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:84%
The brain literally
reorganizes itself

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.330 align:middle line:90%
to reflect a new level of mind.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Which begs the
question, I think,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that most people
really are thinking

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
the same way every day,
acting the same way,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the same way,
but really hoping something

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.967 align:middle line:84%
will show up differently in
their life, and it never does.

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So hard wiring our
brain over time

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
to the same
conditions in our life

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
then causes us to think
equal to everything we know.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And if we believe in any
way that our thoughts have

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
something to do with
our destiny, then

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
as long as we're reacting to
everything we know in our life,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
we keep creating
more of the same.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So neuroplasticity is
the way that the brain actually

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:90%
makes those changes.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the connections of
neurons, is that what it is?

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.147 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, they used
to say that your brain is hard

00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:84%
wired, and you're going to turn
out just like your parents,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and that you're
doomed by your genes,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.130 align:middle line:90%
and that's the end of your life.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we're marvels of
plasticity and adaptability.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you're
evolving your actions

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and modifying your behaviors
to do a better job in life,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:84%
your brain literally
installs new circuitry

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
to reflect your own evolution.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so
that new circuitry

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
comes, though, from our own
thoughts changing our brain,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:84%
or does it come from
the environment?

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I
think most people really

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
wait for trauma, or crisis,
or loss, or disease, tragedy

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.730 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
get to that point

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:84%
where we reach our
lowest denominator,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that's when we begin
to examine ourselves.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And that concept in neuroscience
is called meta cognition.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And meta cognition says
that we can pay attention

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:90%
to how we think.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:90%
We can notice how we feel.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We can become aware
of how we act.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So that those are in place so
we can modify our behaviors

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:84%
to begin to produce
different outcomes.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So plasticity gives us
that permission to do it.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But once again,
though, biology then

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
is a direct result
of consciousness.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep
everything the same,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
then your biology
stays the same.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And now you're headed
for your genetic destiny.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So Dr.
Joe was in a movie

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
called "The People versus
the State of illusion."

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's all about how
we have positive thoughts

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:10%
and they get overridden
by our negative thoughts.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And the whole movie--
it's a great movie.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.567 align:middle line:90%
It made a huge impact on me.

00:06:15.567 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:90%
And I see a lot of movies.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But this was a
transformational film

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:84%
set around a storyline
of a man who basically

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%

single parenting.

And all of those reactions

to our brain, to our

What does that look like in
the brain, negative emotions?

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.005 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, one of the
key components about emotions,

00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
thoughts are the
language of the brain,

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and feelings and emotions
are the language of the body.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we react to
difficult situations

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
in our life,
stressful situations,

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:84%
we turn on that fight or flight
nervous system that begins

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:90%
to mobilize all of this energy.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And what was once very adaptive,
like if you were being chased

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
by a lion thousands
of years ago,

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to mobilize a lot of
energy to either stay and fight

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:90%
or to run.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Now it becomes more
complex in our society,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
because you could
see a co-worker,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
you could see your
mother-in-law--

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%

You could begin to auto suggest
about problems in your life.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And the privilege of
being a human being

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
is that we can make thought
more real than anything else.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we begin
to turn on the stress response

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.037 align:middle line:90%
just by thought alone.

00:09:37.037 --> 00:09:39.245 align:middle line:84%
And stress is when the body's
knocked out of balance.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.315 align:middle line:84%
The stress response is what the
body does to innately turn it

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:43.115 align:middle line:90%
back to order.

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The problem is if you keep
turning on that fight or flight

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
nervous system, that imbalance
now becomes the new balance.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
headed for disease.

>>LISA: Chronic, mm-hmm.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So the
stress in the brain

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:84%
causes the forebrain, or
rational brain to turn off,

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and the hindbrain to begin
to secrete all these juices.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So what was once very adaptive
thousands of years ago

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
becomes very
maladaptive, because it's

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
those chemicals of stress that
push the genetic buttons that

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:90%
begin to create disease.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about this, we
can turn on the stress response

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:90%
just by thought alone.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Then by very nature, our
thoughts can make us sick.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So if our thoughts
can make us sick,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that our
thoughts could make us well?

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a clip that
shows this, that really shows

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:84%
the entire fight or flight
response in the body,

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.463 align:middle line:90%

>>DISPENZA: Sure, we
were just talking about--

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.598 align:middle line:84%
you see a lion in
the Serengeti, you're

00:10:35.598 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:84%
going to turn on a very
primitive nervous system.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
have to be a lion,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.488 align:middle line:84%
it could be your
mother-in-law and you'll

00:10:40.488 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:90%
have the same reaction.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Or you can begin to think
my bills are overdue,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
rent is overdue, I
have problems at work.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And just by you thinking
about your problems,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.770 align:middle line:84%
you begin to turn on the same
reaction in your brain and body

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:84%
as if you were being
chased by a lion.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And that effect, then, that
begins to knock the body out

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:84%
of balance, begins to turn on
this primitive nervous system

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that begins to secrete a lot
of adrenaline and cortisol.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And those chemicals,
those stress hormones,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:90%
give the body a rush of energy.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.820 align:middle line:84%
You're prepared for an
emergency situation.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:90%
So your pupils dilate.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Then your salivary juices
begin to slow down.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
You start to get more blood
pumping into your body.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.197 align:middle line:84%
Your heart rate and respiratory
rate begin to increase.

00:11:25.197 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And blood is sent
to your extremities.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And you're prepared for
an emergency situation.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Now you're ready to
either fight or run.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:90%

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is that
if you're confronting

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.442 align:middle line:84%
the same person in your life,
you're going to the same job,

00:11:39.442 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing the
same co-worker that

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
pushes the same
emotional button,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
that in time then,
you're subconsciously

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
or unconsciously knocking your
brain and body out of balance.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And the long-term effects
then begin to create disease.

become then addicted

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:84%

If you think about
it, if you're getting

00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
a rush of energy, a
rush of adrenaline,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:90%
that's like a triple cappuccino.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you get this
heightened sense of awareness.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
The brain and the body
wake up momentarily.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Now that only should
last for about 90 seconds

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:90%
to two minutes.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I tell my
children all the time,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
if you're angry for more than
two minutes, you're faking it.

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when the
stress response happens,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.400 align:middle line:90%
we should be able to control it.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
A good example of an addiction
is something you can't stop.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you were in the midst
of say an angry reaction

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:84%
to something in your life,
and I came up to you,

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Lisa, listen, I
know you're angry, but why

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:90%
don't you just stop right now?

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Most people would say,
are you kidding me?

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.218 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's because of
this situation and this person.

00:12:43.218 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, yeah, yeah, I
know, but just stop that.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you're unable to stop
the emotional reaction,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
then that's the definition
of an addiction.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So these chemicals
really are highly charged

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:90%
energetic signatures.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And they create the
emotional states

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
of anger, and aggression, and
hatred, and judgment, and fear,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety, and hopelessness,
and powerlessness,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:90%
and depression.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Those chemicals knock
the body out of balance.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to call those
altered states of consciousness

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:90%
normal states of consciousness.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, they're
really causing

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.790 align:middle line:84%
us to live as
primitive human beings.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then they
turn into habits.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.035 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Right, because
as the emotion begins to run,

00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
the chemicals that
run through the body

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:84%
begin to signal the very
thoughts that we think.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in the midst
of an emotional reaction

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:84%
to something or
someone in our life,

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
there's always a gap between the
way things appear and the way

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:90%
things really are.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals alter
our perception.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we react during
the refractory period

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:84%
of those chemicals,
we'll always say,

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:90%
I should've never said that.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:84%
I should have
never thought that.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.650 align:middle line:90%
I should have never done that.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.968 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I mean, if somebody
did something that was wrong,

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and I get upset over it, are
you telling me not to get upset?

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: No, no, I'm saying
that emotions are part of life.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong with
having an emotional reaction.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how long the
refractory period of chemicals

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:90%
run.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep an emotional
reaction running for hours

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:90%
or days, that's called a mood.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask a person,
why are you in this mood,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.737 align:middle line:84%
they'll tell you because
something happened 10 days ago.

00:14:17.737 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep that
refractory period

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.725 align:middle line:84%
going for weeks or months,
that's called a temperament.

00:14:21.725 --> 00:14:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And you'd say, why do you have
such an angry temperament.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And that person
would say something

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.428 align:middle line:90%
happened to me 10 months ago.

00:14:27.428 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep the refractory
period going for years on end,

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
that's called a
personality trait.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And so if we wanted to change
some aspect of our personality,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at the
emotions, layer by layer,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
that we memorize, that's
become part of our identity.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And if emotions are
the record of the past,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.438 align:middle line:84%
and you're living by the
same emotion every day,

00:14:46.438 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:90%
then you're living in the past.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And your body as
the unconscious mind

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
is believing that it's
in the same circumstances

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:90%
24 hours a day--

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.582 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Moment by moment.

00:14:54.582 --> 00:14:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --seven days
a week, 365 days a year.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.303 align:middle line:84%
And that body can't take the
redundancy of those chemicals.

00:15:00.303 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it
begins to break down.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Just like being in the presence
of a lion, in the same cage

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.215 align:middle line:90%
with a lion day long.

00:15:06.215 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All the time.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So emotional
intelligence, then,

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
is learning how to shorten
that refractory period.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to shorten
that refractory period,

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't create your identity.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
You get to say,
just like a child,

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:84%
you move through the
emotion, you get rid of it.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't filter
your perception

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.640 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your day or
for the rest of your life.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is what
resilience is essentially.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have some clips
that I talked to you

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:84%
about that are actual slides of
what the neurons in the brain

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:84%
look like when they create
new responses to things,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:90%
new memories, right?

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Sure, we'll talk
about primarily-- the first two

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:84%
clips show how we have
neurons actually connecting

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and hard wiring into
certain patterns.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK so this could
be a negative pattern or--

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It could
be a negative pattern

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:90%
or a positive pattern.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.870 align:middle line:84%
If you have good habits, and
you have things about yourself

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.390 align:middle line:84%
that you like, and
you do certain things

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that you have become
skilled at, well, that's

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
a good hardwired pattern
that you want to maintain.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
some habits that are

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:84%
self-destructive
or self-limiting,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:84%
those are fired and wired
by your own volition.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Now the principal says that
if you stop thinking, acting,

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the
same way, the nerve

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
cells that no longer
fire together no

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:90%
longer wire together.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:84%
As you stop communicating
neurologically, just

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.880 align:middle line:84%
like any relationship,
you begin to break apart

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:90%
those connections.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.472 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have a
thought in the brain.

00:16:24.472 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:90%
This is what it looks like.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:26.927 align:middle line:90%
Or is this a memory?

00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: So this is a memory.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.720 align:middle line:84%
When two neurons have
fired and wired together,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
they have a lasting
relationship that

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
can be related to any thought,
skill, behavior, concept,

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:90%
or some idea.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.437 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so they
create a synapse together.

00:16:39.437 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: They develop
a long-term relationship.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And those connections facilitate
a stream of consciousness.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:90%
They facilitate a level of mind.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's
another slide here.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So this is
another hardwired neuron.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
They're in a long-term
relationship.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:90%
This could be fear.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:90%
It could be joy.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:90%
It could be brushing your teeth.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Those neurons now have
been used enough times

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:84%
that they're mapped
neurologically in the brain.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they create a
bridge, essentially a chain.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.553 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:17:04.553 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
If you look at this slide here,
this slide represents learning.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Every time you
learn something new

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
you make a new synaptic
connection in your brain.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
So as you pay attention and
you begin to become present

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, your
brain literally up

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
scales its hardware to
reflect the new level of mind.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like it reaches--

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as if it's
reaching for the new--

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: There's
an intelligence there.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's amazing,
because we reach

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:84%
a certain point in our life, I
think, where we stop learning

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.170 align:middle line:90%
and we start feeling.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.155 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we trade
off our own personal evolution.

00:17:40.155 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do
you mean by that?

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, we get
to a point in our life

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:84%
where we pretty much can
predict the feeling of anything.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
You get to be about
35 or 40 years old,

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:84%
psychology tells us that
the personality's usually

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
complete at that point.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:90%
And in some degree, that's true.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And so people experience
relationships,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:90%
they experience sexuality.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.020 align:middle line:84%
They experience their
successes and their failures,

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
their importance, and their
unworthiness, and their guilt.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And they pretty much experience
much of what life has to offer.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you can predict
the feeling of anything,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
well how can anything
new show up in your life,

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
because by very definition,
you're forecasting your future

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:90%
based on your past.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
We've reached this
point where we're

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
using feelings as a
barometer to determine life.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
We'll always miss adventure.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
We'll always miss opportunities.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So when we begin to
continue to learn, continue

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to evolve our actions, continue
to experience new things,

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:84%
continue to step outside the
box and try something else out,

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:84%
you're going to shake up
neurologically your own sub

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:90%
structures in your brain.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a pattern
that you would like to break,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
by introducing new thoughts--and
we're going to get into that--

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.388 align:middle line:84%
but this is what it actually
looks like in the brain.

00:18:48.388 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: The
first stage anytime

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle line:10%
is that you have to begin
to assemble a new mind.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you wanted to become a
more loving parent or a more

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
patient parent, or if
you wanted to become

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
a more successful businesswoman
or a more successful

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.025 align:middle line:84%
entrepreneur, the first thing
you're going to have to do

00:19:06.025 --> 00:19:07.650 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to
have to start asking

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:84%
some important questions, like
what is it to be successful?

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.062 align:middle line:84%
What do I have to change
about myself to be wealthy?

00:19:14.062 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
What does a great
parent look like?

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.388 align:middle line:84%
Who in history was
great that I admire?

00:19:17.388 --> 00:19:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And how did they think?

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.138 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And
how did they think?

00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
read this information,

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
you're installing new
circuits in your brain.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But you better review
that information

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:84%
because it takes a
series of repetitions

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
before you begin to
create networks of neurons

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that will literally
become the forerunner

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:90%
to the next experience.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So now, when you learn that
knowledge, and you apply it,

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and you personalize it,
and you demonstrate it,

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.715 align:middle line:84%
you're going to modify
your behavior in some way.

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you change
your actions,

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.673 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a new experience.

00:19:46.673 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Now experience is
going to really enrich

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:84%
the brain, because
jungles of neurons

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.085 align:middle line:84%
are going to begin to organize
to reinforce the circuits

00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:90%
you learned intellectually.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:84%
The moment that happens, the
experience produces an emotion.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you feel success,
the moment you feel compassion,

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
the moment you feel
like a great parent, now

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
you're instructing and
teaching your body chemically

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
what your mind has
intellectually understood.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So you could say knowledge
is for the brain,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:90%
but experiences is for the body.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Change looks like this.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Most people sit on the couch
with the remote control.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:90%
They got their laptop over here.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.562 align:middle line:90%
They got their smartphone here.

00:20:19.562 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
They got the television
in front of them.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, I think
I'm going to change tomorrow.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you think the
body, as the unconscious mind,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
is going to say?

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:84%
What you think the body as the
mind reader is going to say?

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, it's not.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: No, relax,
you're not going to change.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But when you say, listen,
I don't care how I feel--

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
body, I don't care how
long it takes-- time.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what's going
on in my life-- environment.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And the hair on the back
of your neck stands up.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.220 align:middle line:84%
The body gets a very strong
signal, which means, uh-oh,

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:90%
she's serious this time.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.428 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's an aha moment.

00:20:52.428 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's a moment
where the body gets--

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the decision is
an experience that

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:90%
begins to rewrite the program.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So that being said, there's
no actual amount of time

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that it takes the
change a habit.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Some people can do it overnight.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Some people can
make the decision,

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and the message reaches
the body electrochemically,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:90%
and the person has done.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Other people have
to pay attention.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
They have to really
repeat it enough times.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a length of time
that they're actually putting

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:21.865 align:middle line:90%
their attention behind it.

00:21:21.865 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of variables.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But the key ingredient
is inspiration.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when you come out
of your resting state,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:84%
the body is the servant to
the mind, it's the animal.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And just like when you're
training an unbridled horse,

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
when you get ready
to ride that horse,

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and you pull the reins in,
and you give it a good kick,

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.067 align:middle line:84%
the horse says, OK, the
rider's ready this time.

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's serious, yes.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And if you've
been away from the horse,

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and you climb on that horse,
and you're not ready--

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They'll know.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.267 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The
horse is the mind.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
They did a scientific
experiment where

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:84%
they took a group
of children that

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:90%
scored poorly in mathematics.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And they taught them study
habits, and time management,

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle line:90%
and outlining, and review.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And they gave them a
test three months later.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And these children
scored basically

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.632 align:middle line:90%
the same or slightly higher.

00:22:04.632 --> 00:22:06.090 align:middle line:84%
They took another
group of children

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.257 align:middle line:84%
and they taught them a short
course in neuroscience.

00:22:08.257 --> 00:22:10.470 align:middle line:84%
They showed them pictures
of neurons changing,

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.712 align:middle line:90%
how the brain works.

00:22:11.712 --> 00:22:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And when they took
their test, they

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.540 align:middle line:84%
scored way higher, because they
understood what they were doing

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what I was
saying earlier, that these

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:90%
made such an impact on me.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I will always have this visual
memory of what a memory is

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:25.905 align:middle line:90%
and how it's created.

00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:27.447 align:middle line:90%
It's so interesting to me.

00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: It's exciting.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
we're going to do

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.133 align:middle line:84%
is, we're going to
take a quick break.

00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're going
to figure out what happiness

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:90%
really looks like in the brain.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And how the emotions, when
you create change in the mind,

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and it goes into the body, how
then that can effect change

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:90%
in other people.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
make effect and changes

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:84%
on other people's
healing and growth.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're going to look
at that when we come back.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Joe Dispenza is my guest.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd really like
to find that out.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

>>LISA: Hi, welcome back
to "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
This is Lisa Garr.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.040 align:middle line:90%
My guest is Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about how
to create change in the mind.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Joe, from Facebook,
is actually asking--

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.873 align:middle line:84%
and keep their comments and
questions coming on Facebook

00:23:41.873 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:90%
and Twitter online here--

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
if my thoughts
create my reality,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.565 align:middle line:90%
why isn't anything changing?

00:23:47.565 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's
a great question.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:10%
Because if you're waking
up as the same person,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:10%
and doing the same
things, and you're

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:10%
allowing your environment
to control your thinking,

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:10%
then as long as you keep
seeing the same people that

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:10%
are familiar, and having
the same thoughts,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.983 align:middle line:10%
and feeling the same
familiar emotions,

00:24:06.983 --> 00:24:08.400 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
keep creating more

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.115 align:middle line:10%
of the same familiar
things in your life.

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Because the neural
bridges have been built.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Because your mind--

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:10%
according to the quantum
model of reality,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:10%
your environment is an
extension of your mind.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you truly
change your mind,

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:84%
there should be
evidence in your life.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So most people,
as I said earlier,

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:84%
are trying to create
some type of change

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:90%
in their personal reality.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But they're still
the same personality.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:90%
We have to become somebody else.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to
sit down and you

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.450 align:middle line:84%
began to think about
a new way of being,

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:84%
a new thought that would connect
to a new emotion, that could

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:84%
drive you to plan
a new behavior,

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and you reviewed
that enough times,

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.900 align:middle line:84%
there's a good possibility that
you would change your brain

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:84%
neurologically, and you would
emotionally signal your body

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.160 align:middle line:84%
chemically to signal
new genes, to look

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
like your brain and body
already had the experience.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.750 align:middle line:84%
The biological and
neuroscientific model

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:90%
says it's possible.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you could get up
as a different person

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.150 align:middle line:90%
than you sat down--

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:90%
now here's the key--

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and then to maintain
that modified

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:84%
state of being your
entire day, independent

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
of your environment,
something unusual

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:90%
should happen in your life.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the law.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's like this-- most
people do a meditation.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:90%
They have a great meditation.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they spend the rest of
the day in a state of judgment

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.567 align:middle line:84%
or stress, just like eating
an organic, healthy breakfast

00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and then spending the rest
of your day eating junk food.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.832 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The
purpose of meditation

00:25:38.832 --> 00:25:42.240 align:middle line:84%
is to prime the brain and body
into a new state of being,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.135 align:middle line:84%
to elevate your sense of self
so that the environment is

00:25:46.135 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:84%
no longer-- you're
not effective by it.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you've changed
something inside of you,

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:84%
both neurologically and
chemically, in mind and body,

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
that now you're
beginning to produce

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:90%
an effect in your environment.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So I always recommend,
experiment in your reality.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:90%
We are scientists in our life.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you could say,
OK, I'm taking my time

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.170 align:middle line:90%
out of my busy day today--

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.045 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just going
to use that example.

00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm a busy
mom, and I'm working,

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and all this, and I
have always this tugging

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
feeling that I have to be in
two places at the same time.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I then can change the
programming in my mind and make

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:84%
the decision that I move through
my day with ease and grace--

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I move through my day
with ease and grace,

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:27.930 align:middle line:84%
then things and
people will start

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.363 align:middle line:90%
to align around that, really?

00:26:30.363 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, you
have to start to wire it

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.060 align:middle line:90%
in your brain--

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Until you start to
actually accept the thought,

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It means it's got
to make it past the brain stem

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:90%
and start to stimulate the mind.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And all the
judgment, and the filters,

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and the fast programming,
like we saw in the neurons.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Because if you can't
get beyond the analytical mind,

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
you never enter into the
operating system where

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:90%
the change has to take place.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of meditation is to
get beyond the analytical mind.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.710 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to
change your brainwaves

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and you slip into the operating
system of the subconscious,

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.210 align:middle line:84%
now when you say I move through
my day with grace and ease,

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and flow finds me,
and I live in no time

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and accomplish everything, there
is a biological effect that's

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.880 align:middle line:90%
taking place in your body.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to feel like
what that would feel like,

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
when mind and body
are working together,

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:84%
now you get up in
a state of being.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Because a state of being is
when thoughts and feelings

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:90%
are aligned.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to practice that
enough times so that it begins

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:90%
to become familiar to you.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you did
this, and you said,

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, universal mind, quantum
field, giver of life,

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I took time out of my day
to emulate you as a creator.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So listen, if I'm
just a child of God,

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm practicing
this and experimenting,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I got to know that you're real.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So listen, if you've been
paying attention to my efforts,

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:90%
show me a sign.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But don't show me
a typical sign.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Show me a sign
that I could never

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
predict, that surprises
me, that leaves no doubt

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:84%
that what I did
inside of me produced

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:84%
some result outside
of me, so that I'm

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.747 align:middle line:90%
inspired to do it again.

00:28:04.747 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now this is the
slide of what neuroplasticity

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:90%
looks like in the brain.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The firings that you see are
electrical impulses happening.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.870 align:middle line:90%
And this is as we think.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
How many times a
day does this occur?

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: When you're in
your analytical critical self,

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a certain
level of awareness,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.320 align:middle line:84%
your brain has to
create meaning between

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the external environment and
the internal environment.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.045 align:middle line:84%
That's the function
of the brain.

00:28:26.045 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's gathering all
this data and trying

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:90%
to make meaning out of it.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
to pay attention,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to
focus and concentrate,

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:84%
the frontal lobe acts
like a volume control.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't want
to be distracted

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:90%
by any extraneous stimuli.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So it begins to quiet down the
motor circuits in the brain

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and you become still.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It cools off the
sensory circuits,

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and you no longer
feel your body.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It cools off the
circuits in your brain

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:90%
that process is time and space.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:10%
It even shuts out the
lights in the visual cortex

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:10%
of your brain.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:10%
And it cools off the
mind-brain activity

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:10%
in your association centers.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.430 align:middle line:10%
Now why does this happen?

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:10%
Because when you're
able to quiet down

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:10%
the circuits in your brain that
are reflected to everything

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:10%
you know in your
life, the thought

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:10%
that you're thinking
in that moment

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.570 align:middle line:10%
literally becomes
the experience.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The thought becomes
the experience.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:84%
The brain upscales its
hardware to reflect the thought

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:90%
as the experience.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So when the frontal lobe
is paying attention,

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're truly in
a moment of presence,

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:84%
your brain doesn't want to
be distracted by anything.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So according the
functional scans,

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:84%
as the brain begins to
quiet-- the frontal lobe

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:84%
begins to quiet down the
rest of the brain, that's

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:84%
when you begin to no
longer feel your body.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.520 align:middle line:90%
You lose track of your identity.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.315 align:middle line:84%
You forget about your
external environment.

00:29:40.315 --> 00:29:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
the zone is, isn't it?

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That
zone, then flow,

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.570 align:middle line:84%
that moment where the thought
is you're one with something,

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a biological
reason for it.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the frontal
lobe, the forebrain,

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.010 align:middle line:90%
begins to get in control.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you
suggest that people--

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:84%
someone's asking--
Kate on Facebook--

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.670 align:middle line:84%
shake things up to
break these habits?

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:84%
How do you interrupt
the pattern?

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, this
is the exciting part--

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
this is an exciting
time to be alive.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're happy with
your life the way it is,

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.130 align:middle line:90%
that's wonderful.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:84%
But know I think that people
secretly believe that they

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:90%
could always do a better job.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.292 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if I'm
talking to prison inmates

00:30:16.292 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:90%
or I'm talking to CEOs.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
the brain really

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.950 align:middle line:84%
has a desire to achieve a
higher order of some kind?

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you really?

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I don't
think it's the brain.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it's you and I that
use the brain to create

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.430 align:middle line:90%
different levels of mind.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And so the brain is highly--

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:90%
it's full of water.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:90%
It's 78% water.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It's very plastic.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And to shake things
up, of course,

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.890 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to do
the unpredictable,

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
to begin to step outside of
the familiar, learn new things,

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:84%
apply them, begin to
have new experiences,

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and see if those
experiences lead to wisdom,

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.590 align:middle line:84%
give you a greater
understanding.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And become a scientist
in your life.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I love to begin to
make changes inside of me

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and then look for the
results outside of me.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:90%
I love to see--

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:02.900 align:middle line:84%
if I'm changing my
mind in some way,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
then let's see if there's
evidence in my life.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Think about it-- how do
you know that you're you?

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.640 align:middle line:84%
You look in the mirror and you
see your face, that reflection.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.125 align:middle line:90%
So how does the ego know itself?

00:31:15.125 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the environment.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So your environment then
reflects back to you

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.450 align:middle line:90%
your level of mind.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you can change your
mind then, do it, and see,

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.050 align:middle line:84%
well, let's see, if I change
up something inside of me,

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.642 align:middle line:84%
if there's some
effect outside of me.

00:31:27.642 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And begin to play with
that a little bit,

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:90%
and see where it takes you.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.073 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Experiment a little bit.

00:31:31.073 --> 00:31:34.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a clip that Dr.

"People Versus the

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and it talks all
about how we are

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
able to change and the
addictions to the old habits

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's see that clip.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:53.605 align:middle line:10%
>> The person who memorizes
a great golf swing,

00:31:53.605 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:10%
and they put all
their attention on it,

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.938 align:middle line:10%
and they practice it
over and over again,

00:31:56.938 --> 00:31:59.410 align:middle line:10%
over and over again, over time
that swing will become more

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.210 align:middle line:10%
and more natural.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:10%
That's the beauty of
being a human being.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:10%
By the same means,
the person who

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.020 align:middle line:10%
practices suffering and
thinks of all the reasons

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.450 align:middle line:10%
to complain in their
life, and judges others,

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.240 align:middle line:10%
complains, and blames, and
makes excuses, and feels sorry

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.820 align:middle line:10%
for themselves, they're
doing the same exact thing

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:10%
neurologically as the person
who's mastering the golf swing

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.980 align:middle line:10%
or mastering different
states of mind.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.180 align:middle line:10%
The principle is
absolutely the same.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.020 align:middle line:10%
The effects are different
based on the levels of mind.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:10%
So the repetition
over time not only

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.630 align:middle line:10%
makes the neurons
begin to function

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.400 align:middle line:10%
in more hardwired
patterns, but they

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.470 align:middle line:10%
begin to accommodate
and form more

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.510 align:middle line:10%
stronger connections,
thicker circuits

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:10%
to reflect who and where we are.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.180 align:middle line:10%
We are all masters.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:10%
The question is what have
you memorized so well

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.310 align:middle line:10%
that your internal
order is greater

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.800 align:middle line:10%
than any external
condition in your life.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.275 align:middle line:10%
>> Even when we become aware
of these destructive emotional

00:32:53.275 --> 00:32:56.980 align:middle line:10%
and perceptual patterns,
breaking out of them,

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.650 align:middle line:10%
and thinking and
perceiving in new ways,

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:10%
requires an effort much like the
one an alcoholic or drug addict

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:09.237 align:middle line:10%
must go through to break the
habit of these addictions.

00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
really states the case

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.150 align:middle line:84%
for why we need to change
and why it's difficult.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.530 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned at the
very beginning the show.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to reaffirm
by saying change is difficult.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And I get kind of stuck by that,
because I would like to tell

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:26.750 align:middle line:90%
myself, as if change is easy.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
once again, that's

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.590 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons I wrote
"Breaking the Habit,"

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:34.460 align:middle line:84%
is because once you
understand the how to,

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.430 align:middle line:84%
that you can't use your
conscious mind to do this,

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.660 align:middle line:84%
you have to move beyond
the analytical mind.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
brainwave patterns,

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and when you slip into a
different state of mind,

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:90%
that it's easier to do it.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.085 align:middle line:90%
Because most people then--

00:33:49.085 --> 00:33:52.490 align:middle line:84%
95% of who we are by the
time we're 35 years old

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.010 align:middle line:84%
is a set of memorized
habits and behaviors

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that become part of our
identity or personality.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So 5% of the conscious
mind is trying

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:84%
to change 95% of what
we've memorized, hardwired,

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:90%
become addicted to emotionally.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So the person may want
to think positively,

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.389 align:middle line:84%
but they've been feeling
negatively and oiling

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.909 align:middle line:84%
those programs for
the last 25 years.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:17.360 align:middle line:84%
They might want a new
life with new conditions.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:10%
And as they use
their conscious mind

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.909 align:middle line:10%
to focus on that, their
subconscious mind,

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle line:10%
they've been programmed
to feel guilty.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
That's mind and
body in opposition.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.697 align:middle line:84%
We have to begin to recondition
the body to a new mind.

00:34:28.697 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So change isn't hard, it's just
that you got to get the manual

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.270 align:middle line:84%
to understand how to begin
to unlearn and relearn,

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.485 align:middle line:84%
to break the habit of the old
self and reinvent the new self.

00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Joe on Facebook is
familiar with the phrase

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.050 align:middle line:90%
of acting as if.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.929 align:middle line:90%
How do you act as if?

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:48.560 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be a disconnect for
him, where he's acting as if,

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:84%
but he really knows
it's not happening?

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.969 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, this is a
kind of an interesting paradigm,

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:57.160 align:middle line:84%
because Newtonian physics
is about cause and effect.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:84%
You and I wait for--
for most people,

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.370 align:middle line:84%
they wait for a
reason to feel joyful,

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.100 align:middle line:90%
for a reason to feel gratitude.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And when the event happens,
then they give thanks.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:90%
That's cause and effect.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.210 align:middle line:84%
The quantum model
of reality really

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:90%
says something different.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The quantum model
of reality says

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:84%
you have to change your
mind and body, thoughts

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and feelings ahead
of the actual event,

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:84%
so your brain and body
are physically changed

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
to look like it's
already happened.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you begin to
give thanks ahead

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.080 align:middle line:84%
of the experience-- and
your body, by the way,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:90%
is the unconscious mind.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.060 align:middle line:84%
It does not know the difference
between an event in your life

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that produces an
emotion or an emotion

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.230 align:middle line:84%
that you fabricate
by thought alone.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:84%
To the body, it's
the exact same.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So,
if you could begin

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:84%
to move into a state in which
you were giving thanks before

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:84%
it took place, and you could
convince your body emotionally

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that that then already
happened because you were

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:84%
in a state of gratitude, then
you would begin to literally

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:84%
biologically change your
body to no longer be

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.490 align:middle line:84%
a record of the past, but now,
in fact, a map to the future.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if your brain
and body are beginning

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to respond neurologically
and chemically,

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.040 align:middle line:84%
now you're moving into
a new state of being.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get up
in that state of being,

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:84%
then what you did inside of
you should cause and effect

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:90%
outside of you.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum model
says then that we

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
have to give thanks
ahead of the event.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.450 align:middle line:84%
We have to move into the state
of joy and change our energy

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.610 align:middle line:84%
before it happens, so
much so that we're not

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.500 align:middle line:84%
using our senses to
determine reality any longer.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So if we're living by
the emotion of pessimism,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.175 align:middle line:90%
or depression, or sadness, or--

00:36:38.175 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can't
see those potentials.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You cannot
see those potentials,

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.960 align:middle line:84%
because the emotion, which
is connected to the past,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:84%
is actually filtering
your perception.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:84%
In order for you to
begin to see possibility

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.030 align:middle line:84%
you got to look at
the thoughts that

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.740 align:middle line:84%
are creating that
pessimism, that

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.620 align:middle line:84%
are happening behind the
scenes of your awareness.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.040 align:middle line:84%
You got to look at your
behaviors that demonstrate

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.140 align:middle line:90%
pessimism or unhappiness.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to look
at the other emotions that

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:90%
are generated from pessimism.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
observe those programs

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:84%
it means you're no
longer to the program,

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.210 align:middle line:84%
you're the consciousness
observing the program.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you can become
so familiar with the way

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:21.380 align:middle line:84%
you think, act, and feel, so
much so that they would never

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.110 align:middle line:84%
go by unnoticed by
you, biologically,

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and neurologically,
and chemically you

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:84%
would begin to break the
circuits in your brain that

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:90%
are connected to the old you.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Because nerve cells
that no longer

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.170 align:middle line:84%
fire together no
longer wire together.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you no longer signal
the same gene emotionally,

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:41.330 align:middle line:84%
because you're no longer
allowing those emotions to be

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.180 align:middle line:84%
created in the body,
and you begin to say,

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
now, let me think about
what joy looks like.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Let me begin to
demonstrate optimism.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to read about,
say, Ernest Shackleton,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.510 align:middle line:84%
who crossed the Antarctic
with all those men

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and spent $600 days away
and because of his optimism,

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:90%
he overcame--

00:38:02.587 --> 00:38:05.210 align:middle line:84%

to think, well, if that guy can

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.320 align:middle line:90%
do it, I can do it.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And you began to
plan your behaviors,

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and you began to modify them to
produce different experiences

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.240 align:middle line:84%
that created different
emotions, you

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:84%
would literally begin to
reinvent neurologically

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.570 align:middle line:90%
and biologically a new self.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.750 align:middle line:90%

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:20.865 align:middle line:90%
That is a very cool, yes.

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But
most people don't

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.623 align:middle line:90%
like to look in the dark place.

00:38:24.623 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They would rather turn on the
TV, or get on the cell phone

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.460 align:middle line:90%
and complain.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.530 align:middle line:84%

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why I have a
radio show called "Aware Show,"

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:32.110 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.760 align:middle line:84%

is you can learn and change

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.260 align:middle line:84%
in a state of pain and suffering

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.930 align:middle line:84%
in a state of joy

they've broken down.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to get a whole recap
of that, I want

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.730 align:middle line:84%
you to watch this next clip,
because it shows the full,

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:84%
in an animation way,
what this looks like,

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.135 align:middle line:90%
how you can create this change.

00:38:57.135 --> 00:38:58.558 align:middle line:90%

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:40.730 align:middle line:84%
The ease and grace is something
that I go in and out of.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to be
in ease and grace

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.060 align:middle line:90%
more than I fall out of it.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So I understand I'm a work
in progress with that.

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I give myself
patience on that.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:51.905 align:middle line:84%
But I really would like to be in
that ease and grace state more.

>>DISPENZA: I'm going

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.850 align:middle line:90%
part of all of this.

The hardest part of all of this,
everything we're talking about,

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.150 align:middle line:90%
is one simple thing.

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:90%

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Making the
time for your precious self

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate the people in
your life and the things

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.300 align:middle line:84%
that you do, just for
a short period of time

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up in the
morning or before you

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:84%
go to bed at night,
and you say, OK,

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.050 align:middle line:84%
what is the greatest ideal of
myself that I want to be today.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:84%
But listen, I'm not going to
get up until I am this person.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to wrestle
with your limitations

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:90%
and overcome them.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:35.090 align:middle line:84%
There's so much talk in the
United States about self-love.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:39.380 align:middle line:84%
People think self-love
is getting a manicure

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.840 align:middle line:90%
or buying a sports car.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:90%
That's not self-love.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.280 align:middle line:90%
That's pleasure.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Self-love is when you're
sitting with yourself

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and you are working
on overcoming

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.590 align:middle line:84%
your hardwired
thoughts, or beliefs,

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:53.780 align:middle line:84%
or your emotional
propensities that

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.590 align:middle line:84%
are connected to your
past, and you are really

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:58.940 align:middle line:90%
working to overcome them.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And right on the other side
of your pain is freedom.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Right on the other side
of your fear is courage.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Right on the other side
of your sadness is joy.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:07.890 align:middle line:90%
It's the same energy.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just trapped in the body.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you stretch
yourself past that point,

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and you break free
from the chains

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.930 align:middle line:84%
of those emotional addictions,
a side effect of that

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:19.130 align:middle line:90%
is called joy.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And the body is liberated
from that level of mind.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
there's available energy

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.230 align:middle line:90%
to create with.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you
break through that,

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.590 align:middle line:90%
you begin to love yourself.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:32.840 align:middle line:90%
You begin to respect yourself.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to love
and respect others,

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:84%
because you see
yourself in them.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're
free from it,

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.050 align:middle line:84%
you can understand
them with compassion,

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:84%
without knee jerking
in the same way.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So the difficulty here is
really making the time to do it.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you began to think
about a new way of being,

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and you've moved into
a state where you said

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get up
until I am this person.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And not only did you memorize
it neurologically in your brain,

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.130 align:middle line:84%
but you allowed the
thoughts that you

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:84%
were thinking to become
the experience to the point

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.080 align:middle line:84%
that your body as
the unconscious mind

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:84%
began to live in that future
reality in the present moment.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you got up when mind
and body were working together

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.300 align:middle line:84%
in that state of
being, and you said,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to maintain the
state of being my entire day.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care, bring
on the challenges,

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.550 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
test my greatness,

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and you did that the entire
day, the end of your day, when

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.400 align:middle line:84%
you finished your day,
more than likely you'd

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.025 align:middle line:84%
have more energy than
when you started.

00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:31.983 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Forget neuroscientists,
you should just

00:43:31.983 --> 00:43:33.185 align:middle line:90%
be a motivational speaker.

00:43:33.185 --> 00:43:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Because that was so
beautifully put, absolutely.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the time
that you practice that

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.190 align:middle line:84%
in the morning gets shorter,
and shorter, and shorter,

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:84%
before it becomes a
habit, just like we

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:42.830 align:middle line:90%
saw with the connections.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And the
word meditation,

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.240 align:middle line:84%
the literal translation of
the word meditation in Tibetan

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.160 align:middle line:90%
means to become familiar with.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.620 align:middle line:84%
The symbol means to
become familiar with.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you're becoming
conscious of or familiar

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.950 align:middle line:84%
with your unconscious
self, to the point you're

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:middle line:84%
so conscious of your
unconscious thoughts,

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.420 align:middle line:84%
so familiar with your
unconscious habits,

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and so aware of your
emotions, that you would never

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.450 align:middle line:84%
let them go by unnoticed
by you, there's

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:10.580 align:middle line:84%
no chance for you to return
back to the old self--

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:11.780 align:middle line:90%
to know thyself.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And then if you became
familiar with a new self,

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.510 align:middle line:84%
because you neurologically fired
and wired it in your brain,

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.623 align:middle line:84%
and you emotionally
conditioned your body,

00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and you were able to
do it enough times,

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:23.032 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later it
would get easier,

00:44:23.032 --> 00:44:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and it would become
more familiar to you.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.032 align:middle line:84%
And you would be able to move
into that state of being.

00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:84%
By the way, a new state of
being is a new personality.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.913 align:middle line:84%
And a new personality is
a new personal reality.

00:44:32.913 --> 00:44:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So one of our
Facebook listeners

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is asking about his father,
who has a habit of smoking.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And is that something
that he could

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:42.740 align:middle line:84%
help him break that
habit, or does it

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.880 align:middle line:84%
have to come from his
father's internal will?

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.285 align:middle line:84%
How do you break something
that's a chain habit like that?

00:44:50.285 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, one of
the things about substances

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is that it actually
helps to change chemistry

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:57.710 align:middle line:90%
in the brain and body.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So there becomes a chemical
dependence on it at that point.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But the person who wants to
change has to want to change.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the first element.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: In other words,
no one can make you change,

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.588 align:middle line:84%
but you have to find
it in you to really see

00:45:12.588 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:90%
if this is what you want to do.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've studied people
over the last 12 years.

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that one
person, an old timer,

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.410 align:middle line:84%
can look at his X-rays, and
see a spot on his lungs,

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:26.370 align:middle line:90%
and the doctor will say to him--

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.860 align:middle line:84%
hey, George, that's
a spot on your lungs.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing now, but if you
keep smoking, it will be.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And that guy just
takes his cigarettes,

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.450 align:middle line:84%
throws them in the trash
and he's done the next day.

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.450 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.000 align:middle line:90%
He made the decision.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And the decision
was an experience.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And it began to rewrite his
chemistry and his biology.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Hey, how can a person
who moves into a state

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.690 align:middle line:84%
of religious ecstasy, a

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:52.090 align:middle line:84%
drink strychnine and
not get poisoned by it?

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:52.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a decision.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:90%
It's an energetic decision.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.633 align:middle line:84%

>> So if I had 60 seconds to
live and I had something tell

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.310 align:middle line:10%
the world, I think my message
would be something pretty

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.110 align:middle line:10%
simple.

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:25.060 align:middle line:10%
I would say our
whole purpose in life

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.180 align:middle line:10%
really is not to be good,
or do the right thing,

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:10%
or to be successful, or to be
famous, or to even please God.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.580 align:middle line:10%
Our whole purpose in life is
to express God through us,

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.920 align:middle line:10%
to express that divinity
through all of us.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.930 align:middle line:10%
And the way that
we do that is we

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:10%
transform ourselves from an
old state to a new state.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.460 align:middle line:10%
And when we begin to
remove those limitations,

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.440 align:middle line:10%
that's when that
intelligence that gives us

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.550 align:middle line:10%
life, that is the source, begins
to express itself through us

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.520 align:middle line:10%
and we become more like it.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautifully stated.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.070 align:middle line:84%
We're not doomed by our genes
, or our genetic profile,

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:06.280 align:middle line:84%
or our circumstances
that we were raised in.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.150 align:middle line:84%
We are and we have the full
ability to be able to change.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And I say co-create with
God, but however people

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.530 align:middle line:90%
want to do it to.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To be able to
change your circumstances.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:17.763 align:middle line:90%
And that goes for--

00:47:17.763 --> 00:47:19.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it
also go for people

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that have anxiety
and things that

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.780 align:middle line:90%
come from genetic patterns?

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Absolutely, I
mean, anxiety is just really

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.450 align:middle line:84%
just conditioning your
body to live in the future

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and expecting the
worst case scenario.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Depression is just
looking in the past,

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.810 align:middle line:84%
so much so that your
body begins to see

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.550 align:middle line:90%
hopelessness and powerlessness.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.100 align:middle line:90%

amazing inspiration.
