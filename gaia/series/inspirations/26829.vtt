00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Hi I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Since everybody is
different, would you

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:10%
like to know how to select
the right supplements

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.810 align:middle line:10%
for your individual body?

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:10%
Or would you like
to know the source

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:10%
of your own individual
physical pain?

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.411 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that you can
create an intuitive dialogue

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:10%
with your body?

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.670 align:middle line:10%
And you can learn
to really listen

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:10%
and tune into what
your body wants.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today to help us take
our power back over our health

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
is author and medical
intuitive Caroline Sutherland.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Caroline started
noticing her gifts

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
of being able to see
into a person's body

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and intuitively hear
what the body wants.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's here to share
her story with us.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, to teach us how
to tune into our own body

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and really listen to what we
need in order to live vibrant

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and really healthy lives.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being with
me today, Caroline.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Oh well it's wonderful
to be here with you, Lisa.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:90%
So what is a medical intuitive?

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:10%
A medical intuitive
is a person who

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:10%
has the ability to see
beyond the normal levels

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:10%
of perception.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:10%
And in my case,
it's an awareness

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:10%
around the physical
body and imbalances

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:10%
in the physical body.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:10%
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So did you notice these
that you had these gifts

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:90%
when you were a child?

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Or what was your child like?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I was just a normal
kid, you know,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
climbing trees, and riding my
bicycle, and not doing anything

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
intuitive at all.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And what really switched it on
was learning how to do muscle

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:84%
testing, or kinesiology, that I
really recommend that everyone

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:90%
should learn how to do.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:90%
And I learned that.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I learned to do a
whole body scan.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And in the process, I got sick.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I had the early warning
signs of multiple sclerosis.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I got sent to a
doctor who specialized

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
in environmental medicine, which
is a branch of medicine that

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
deals with the human body in
relationship to everything

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that a person's
eating, or breathing,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
or coming in contact with and
the effects of all of that.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I started out in
environmental medicine.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And at that same time, I
took a course in meditation.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you do
kinesiology and you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
tune into the body
with muscle testing,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and you're meditating as
well, then you know you've got

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:90%
this combination of instinct.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But that's what happened
to me when I got sick.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I got sick, and I went
to see this doctor.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:90%
I got better.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, he asked me
to come and work for him

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and do allergy testing
in a clinical setting.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.871 align:middle line:84%
You were raised by a family
of medical doctors, right?

00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So how did they
feel about you going

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:84%
after this intuitive route
or this unconventional route?

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Well I think that
definitely planted the seeds

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:90%
for me in my childhood.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to be a
registered nurse.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I would run around with
nurses hats and kidney basins,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and wrap bandages
around my pets,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and dolls, and family members.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, I saw my
first sight of blood.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:90%
And that shocked me.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I'm not going
to be a nurse because not

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
only will I be
seeing blood, but it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
will be a lot of other things
I want to see, as well.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I followed
a course of arts,

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and studied arts, and
used that in my background

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:84%
as a lot of fashion
and interior design.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, I started
out in this area.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And because of my
illness, I got involved

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:90%
in what this was all about.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:90%
What was environmental medicine?

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:90%
What did the body want?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Want were food allergies?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:90%
What where food sensitivities?

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
As far as my family
is concerned,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
my father died when
he was very young.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
My mother really
never approved of what

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I was doing because her
raising-- and, of course,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
she was married to my father
for many years-- was always

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:90%
conventional western medicine.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So that was a big
bridge to cross.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And in our family, the
doctor was always God.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, and nobody
else had a clue

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:84%
or could talk about the physical
body, except the doctor.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:90%
But now we know that's not true.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%
So we are our own physician.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And the members
of our health team

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:84%
are going to be, of
course, hopefully,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
a doctor and other
alternative practitioners.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But we should be the
guiding light of our health.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:84%
Well that would be nice
if we are able to take back

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:90%
our power of our own health.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a
collaborative relationship

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:90%
with the doctor and you.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think doctors would
appreciate that, as well--

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.549 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
--where the patient
takes responsibility

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and takes on what their
expertise gives you.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So what you did with the
environmental medicine

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.490 align:middle line:84%
worked for you and
healed your body, right?

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Literally, in four weeks
from the early warning

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
signs of multiple sclerosis, I
was symptom free in four weeks.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And I had many, many symptoms
from little mini blackouts,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and memory loss, and issues with
balance, bumping into things.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was all
food intolerances?

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:90%
It was food intolerance.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It was the candied
yeast syndrome.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
It was neurotransmitter
imbalances

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:90%
but mostly those two.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And it displayed as
multiple sclerosis.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine the
number of people that are.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I just
blogged about a very

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
famous person who now
has been diagnosed

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:90%
with multiple sclerosis.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you
know, I would take a look

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
at these other things
first before you really

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:90%
accept that that's the case.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And in most, I mean, even
heart disease and cancer,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:84%
the most important thing you
can do is to clean up your diet.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:90%
And a doctor will tell you that.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:90%
But you don't really understand.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.472 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a
big thing to say.

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Where do you start?

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Where do you start with that?

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Well you start with food.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
it, it's like a wheel.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
If you think of
everything in your life,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:90%
it spins off a central place.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's your ability
to be able to purchase

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:90%
food to keep yourself alive.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So you think of all the
relationships that you have,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
everybody you meet,
everything that's happening

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
are all based
around your ability

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have an income
to stay on the planet.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense to go back
to the center of that wheel

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and correct with food because
everything is spinning

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:90%
out from there to begin with.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So you became a
medical intuitive

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.637 align:middle line:84%
as a result of going
through thousands

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of testing?

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Well it was years
of allergy testing.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
The doctor that I
was seeing asked

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
me to be a patient
counselor to begin with.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, I learned to do subtle
energy testing with equipment

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
from Europe.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had thousands and
thousands of patients right

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
through the whole clinic and
through the whole system.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.435 align:middle line:84%
And I would test them
for various sensitivities

00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to all kinds of things
from cats, dogs, feathers,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.795 align:middle line:90%
And I would just pick up a vial.

00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:90%
It might be for a cat.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even have
it in the machine

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and I know just
picking up, uh oh,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:90%
cats a problem for this person.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:90%
So you really did--

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:90%
--fine tune your skills.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So we can really, through
practice, do the same thing.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I wanted you to touch on a
story that I read about about

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
when you met Louise Hay.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Well Louise Hay
is one of the most

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
important metaphysical teachers
and authors on the planet.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I, basically, set the
intention to write a book.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And I went through all
the motions of going

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:90%
through the different channels.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
I was down in San Diego.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.982 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a big presentation
for a big health expo.

00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman in
San Diego that had organized

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
my events down there and my
personal appointments, which I

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:90%
still do personal appointments.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And she told me late at
night when I got the hotel,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
she said, Caroline, I faxed
through your schedule,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
going to love it.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:90%
It's in a rainbow of colors.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And I faxed it
through the hotel.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's your schedule
for the next few days.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh boy, when
I get to the front desk

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:84%
to get my fax, it's
going to be two colors.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
One's black and one's
white, and that's it.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.034 align:middle line:90%
So there it was.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:90%
There was the schedule.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was all black lines
for where people's names

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.954 align:middle line:90%
were and the times I could see.

00:07:37.954 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, this
is going to be interesting.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be lively.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be an adventure.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning at
10 o'clock in the morning,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:90%
I get the call.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:90%
This is Louise Hay.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Louise Hay?

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:90%
The Louise Hay?

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:90%
This is she.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for my appointment.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So I met her, and I'm so happy
that I didn't have any advance

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
notice because if I had
have had advance notice,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd be up all night
second guessing.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.267 align:middle line:84%
Should we do this?
Should we do that?

00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I just looked at
her, and I just went

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.466 align:middle line:90%
bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
I would suggest you did.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Her jaw dropped a mile.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, I followed
up with her later.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And she said she
had much more energy

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and what were some of the
things that she should also do,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:84%
which I have guided
her with those things.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:90%
And now here she is at 85.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And she's just
doing marvelously.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] beautiful, yes.
Absolutely.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, she always stands
up in front of huge groups

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and she'll say I
credit or she'll

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
say I blame Caroline Sutherland
for my excellent health.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And here she is at 85.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's possible.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:90%
The body has that capacity.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So it was my
privilege to help her.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
she got excited.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.487 align:middle line:84%
And she encouraged me to write
my first book, The Body Knows.

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Well that had to do
with your intention also.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.719 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's learn how to do
some of this ourselves.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Where do you suggest we start?

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
With tuning into
specific objects

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:90%
or how do we start with this?

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Well the first
thing, and Gaiam TV

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
really does help with this with
all the other presenters that

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:84%
are on the shows
but to really have

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:90%
a good meditation practice.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be anything fancy.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just the whole
notion of I am.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So you just used the
words I am piece.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:90%
I am love.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:90%
I am health.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is to talk yourself
down into that deep state.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So you just use I am, and pop
the word in that feels right.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Like, I am calm, for example.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And you just say that and
say that over and over

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
again until you do
reach that state.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a little
moment there, this one

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
little tiny moment when you
just say to yourself I'm

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:90%
not thinking.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:90%
You say, isn't that amazing?

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
For that one moment,
I wasn't thinking.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:90%
So you've reached that place.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So at the place of-- and
even three deep breaths

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:90%
will take you down.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So three deep breaths will
take you down to that place

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:90%
where you're receptive.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you're receptive,
you can be available.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear the
wisdom of your own body

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, the
wisdom of the divine

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:84%
because you co-create every
moment with the divine.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:84%
You're not creating
singly and by yourself.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
You're co-creating
with the universe.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you let the
universe speak to you,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:90%
then you'll get the information.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's
something like, well, we

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
don't have that
for you right now

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
or you kind of get the
feeling that there's

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:90%
more information to come.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I teach people how to
tune into elements of nature.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's a great
place to start, yeah.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.029 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:10%
So for example, if you
come and train with me,

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:10%
the first thing I do is
give each person a hand-out.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And it has a few elements
of nature, like a tree.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And it might have a piece of
wood, or it might have a rock,

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
or it might have
a river or a lake.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And the exercise as
part of a training

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:84%
is to actually go
and communicate

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:90%
with these elements.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, to hold a
stone or to look at a tree.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And stay really
quiet and tune in.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And try and calm down
that rational mind.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And listen to see what
the tree will tell you.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:90%
What has the tree told you?

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well the tree
will tell me anything.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But the tree, the wisdom, the
higher wisdom of the object

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:90%
will communicate.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like, oh, I
see the tree is green.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not like that.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:90%
The tree will say stand sure.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.267 align:middle line:84%
And that's my family
motto is stand sure.

00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
we should all be doing.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Standing very sure in
wherever we are in our life.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:90%
And so you listen.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's surprising in a group
of people that come to train

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
with me some of the
amazing messages

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that they get from trees, and
rocks, and pieces of wood.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking
this is amazing.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But people are able
to do it very quickly.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a great idea.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So you can really get the
messages from these elements.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a great place to start.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a good practice
ground for a rock feeling

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:90%
steady, and quiet, and still.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's a
message for calming down,

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and stop rushing so much.
-That's right.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But for example, if a
person's close to a beach,

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:90%
they can go to the beach.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And when they get to beach,
say the ocean is going

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:90%
to give me a message today.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, just walk along
the beach and just listen.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:90%
What is the ocean saying?

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:10%
And it'll be
something like calm,

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:10%
and peace, or something
else will come.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Now is this a good
way to, maybe, measure

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
your levels of happiness
or fulfillment?

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Is that a good way
to be able to get

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:90%
into tune with your purpose?

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Now that's an
incredible thing to do.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
I show the person

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.275 align:middle line:84%
on a slide three kind of,
like, a little barometer

00:12:40.275 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:90%
or little thermometer.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And I have them put
their hand on their heart

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and ask the question, what is
my personal level of happiness?

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, so with your eyes
closed and hand on their heart,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
it'll be on a scale of 1 to
100 or a scale of 1 to 10

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
what is their personal
level of happiness.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I just invite everyone
to just try this.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Right now as Caroline
is talking to you,

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.107 align:middle line:84%
what is your personal
level of happiness?

00:13:04.107 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Put your hand on your heart.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:84%
What is your personal
level of happiness?

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:84%
What's another thing?
-That's right.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So right away, they'll
get an instinctive answer.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So they'll be two
kinds of answers.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:90%
One that's a rational answer.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Oh, for heaven's sake, my
personal level of happiness

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:90%
must be 100.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But go down deeper
to what is it really.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
instinctive level.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And that might come up 50 or
60, or even less, or even more.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And so that's one.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Another one that
I like very well

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is what is my overall
level of health.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And I love it when
the response is 90%.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.392 align:middle line:90%
That's what you want, 90%.

00:13:38.392 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Well sure you want 100%,
but even 90 is wonderful.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:90%
So hand on heart again.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
What is my overall
level of health?

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Tune in.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Stay kind of quiet if you
have to do to two or three

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:84%
deep breaths to get yourself
centered at the heart level.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.300 align:middle line:90%
See, the heart knows.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:90%
The brain will rationalize it.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:90%
The mind will rationalize it.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But the heart knows you cannot
deny the wisdom of the heart.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's a good one.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, another one is
your level of fulfillment

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:90%
in your career or outer life.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really important
one because many, many people

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:84%
are wasting so much time,
so much of their life,

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
doing things they
don't like to do.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So the heart will tell you,
same thing, ask that question.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.151 align:middle line:84%
So that's part one of
what I like to teach.

00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, the second
part is now, then,

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
the person stays really
quiet and, kind of, tunes

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
into the universe
spirit, whatever.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And ask what are the ways to
raise the level of happiness?

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
What are the ways
to raise fulfillment

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:90%
in my career or outer life?

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
What are the ways to get
a higher level of health?

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.411 align:middle line:84%
And really listen because
we intuitively know.

00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-We do.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
We're probably the
best ones that know

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.051 align:middle line:84%
the answers to those questions.
-That's right.

00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And for instance, if I
do a reading for somebody,

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, well,
you know, I knew that.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:90%
I knew my thyroid was out.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Or I knew that wheat
was bothering me.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Or I knew I shouldn't be
having all that sugar,

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:90%
whatever the thing was.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And so people do
know but sometimes

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
just to have a
guide post to move

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:90%
them in the right direction.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a really fun way.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:10%
But to take that moment
or two to just calm down

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:10%
the nervous system, and just
take a few deep breaths,

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:10%
and then start to tune in.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Then, you really get
accurate answers.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
can do that any time.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.677 align:middle line:84%
Well we tend to go outside of
ourselves for those answers.

00:15:23.677 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-And we go to doctors.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying not
to go to the doctor

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
but that we look
to the other person

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.155 align:middle line:84%
to have all of the answers,
or the books, or the seminars

00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we have
all of that knowledge inside

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves maybe just
takes someone like you

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
with all of your
experience to give

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
us permission to say, yeah,
you do have those answers.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Try this simple exercise.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
really important.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, in my own life, I
was raised in a medical family.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.855 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
doctor was God.

00:15:49.855 --> 00:15:54.410 align:middle line:10%
And woe betide that you had any
other thoughts but your own.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how I was raised.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So believe me, that was a really
big step to cross that Rubicon

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
into teaching people
and understanding

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that the body has wisdom, and
it's trying to communicate.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
It communicates with
signs and symptoms.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I think, actually, my father
was a medical doctor, as well.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And he had 38 years
of medical practice.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And he did know a lot as
an amazing diagnostician.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I think if doctors had
patients come to them with more

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
of their intuitive
experience-- not

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to do so much of
the self-diagnosis--

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:84%
but if it was more of a
co-collaborative relationship,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:84%
that, I believe, is
the future of medicine.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And I get doctors, and nurses,
and chiropractors, and massage

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
therapists in my
classes because they

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:84%
know that there is
an instinctive side,

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
and how can they add that in.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So what's another fun
technique for learning

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
how to tune into our
intuitive abilities

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:84%
because you said we all
have these abilities.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Right?
-Oh, absolutely.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
These abilities are not the
domain of a few gifted people.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
really for everybody.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.245 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:00.245 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a
bottle of vitamins.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you're
going to the health food store

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking for
a particular vitamin,

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:90%
then there's a neat way.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
You really do it standing.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
You, obviously, might not find
a seat in the health food store

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:90%
to be able to sit down.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But the right way
is really standing.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
So you might be going to
look for, say, a vitamin.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:84%
A particular vitamin B or
vitamin C, whatever it is.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
array, three or four,

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking
for the right one.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.569 align:middle line:90%
So you take it, and you hold it.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And the best place is
right here at this level.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
the thymus gland

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:90%
but really at the heart level.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And just see if you lean into
it, the idea of just, sort of,

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:90%
leaning into it.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Is it useful?

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Or does this particular
one, kind of,

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:90%
repel you a little bit?

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So if there's three or four, you
pick each one up, and you feel

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
are you drawn to it, or
are you drawn away from it?

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
ways that you can test,

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:84%
quite simply, for a particular
vitamin, for example.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a muscle
testing that you taught

00:17:59.030 --> 00:17:59.890 align:middle line:90%
me, as well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, now I like that.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show it to you.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It's basically, I
call it circle testing

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:90%
in my book, The Body Knows.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So you take your dominant
hand, and you make a circle

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:90%
with your dominant hand.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And with your non-dominant
hand, you make a little hook.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And you place it
inside the circle.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's a circle and a hook.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.631 align:middle line:84%
And then, we just happen
to have some foods on hand.

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Just happen to have.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So then, for example, you
test your foods that you're

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.905 align:middle line:90%
kind of suspicious of.

00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And we'll show you several
ways of testing these foods.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So I have, basically,
bread, which is wheat.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.330 align:middle line:90%
And then, I have salad.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Two things, salad
greens and tomatoes.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:90%
So strong, that's your strength.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.251 align:middle line:84%
And then, your weakness
is if it breaks.

00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Falls apart.
OK.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be able
to tune in because you

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:43.370 align:middle line:90%
can control this.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Your whole intent is to know.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
When I'm with people, it's
show me, show me, show me.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:90%
You want to know.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's really not going to
help you to control something.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, if these were
cups of coffee-- they're not--

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and we were testing
those, some person would

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:90%
really want to control that.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And other people would really
want to know does that caffeine

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:90%
really bother them.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:90%
So you get yourself oriented.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And you should be able to
see the backs of your hands.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to test.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to tune
in and you test.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And you ask whether or not
your body goes weak on that.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So you hold it over
it, but it goes weak.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
For me, this will be strong,
which is the lettuce.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:90%
And then, I go weak on tomatoes.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So for me, and it may have
something to do with my age,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
but I don't do well with
anything really, really acid.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.565 align:middle line:84%
So if you took that
off, for example,

00:19:36.565 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and you put cucumbers on
the top, or you put olives,

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
or you put a little
bit of grated carrot,

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
or a little goat feta,
or maybe some walnuts

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and tested it again, you might
be strong for the whole thing.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:90%
You might go weak on an element.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
It could be the dressing.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
simple way of testing.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's extremely
reliable, this one.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.415 align:middle line:90%
You get good at it.

00:19:56.415 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It takes two or three
days to get good at it.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a way
to be able to, again,

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
these are tools and techniques
for learning how to develop

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:90%
our own intuitive skills.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And it takes practice.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And these are kind of fun things
to be able to experiment with.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:90%
You also use a pendulum.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I like to
teach the pendulum.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And I love it when
doctors-- I know

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:84%
holistic doctors who teach their
patients with the pendulum.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:90%
So get back to the foods again.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you need to
know what a yes is and a no is.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a yes for
me is, basically, a circle.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, the pendulum will
move in the way of a circle.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, a no for me is
always a back and forth.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But everyone's a
little bit different.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting because you
didn't move your hand at all.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:90%
No, there's no movement.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
When I pick up a
pendulum, it just knows.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.660 align:middle line:84%
It knows what I'm
going to be doing.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.111 align:middle line:84%
-So that takes practice.
-Yeah.

00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things you want to do

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:84%
is really prop your arm right
next to your body so it's firm.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Or you can use a table.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, prop your
elbow on a table.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And you want to find out the
difference in the movement.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So you want to
know what a yes is,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and know what a no is, and
know the difference between.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And it'll take a few
days to get good at it.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily
get good right away.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:90%
But you bring your foods back.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.551 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll test, for example,
your little bit of lettuce

00:21:10.551 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's take these off because
my body doesn't want them.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But you can test
for your lettuce,

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and it will give you a yes.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
For example, I have in my
purse some pecans or walnuts.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I'd probably get a yes on that.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, you move
this over here.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:90%
And go over to your tomatoes.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't even do anything.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.881 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it starts
to go no on the tomatoes.

00:21:31.881 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
-Interesting.
-So this is a great little tool.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:84%
A simple medallion
around your neck.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a little bit of string
and just a little bit medallion

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
that I happen to have
just with the string.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So it can be
anything with weight.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but you know
what's important

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.300 align:middle line:84%
about this is you can
teach it to parents

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.751 align:middle line:90%
so they can tune into babies.

00:21:48.751 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you have a baby
with colic and you're thinking,

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
now why does this
baby have colic?

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
You can tune in and ask
a question for the baby.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So what is something
called the challenge test?

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:90%
A challenge test.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:84%
That's where you would
take food, for example.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's say a person has a
lot of gas and bloating.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking,
why am I gaining weight,

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and why am I feeling
so awful digestively?

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:90%
And they kind of suspect.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's say they have
toast every morning

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
or muffins that are
made from wheat.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So you sit down first
thing in the morning

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:84%
to about two slices
of bread, for example,

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:84%
or two glasses of
milk, or something

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that you're suspicious of
and is a known allergy.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So you consume those
two slices of that bread

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:90%
and wait 20 minutes.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And then, you test your pulse.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to know what your pulse
rate is before you do the test.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And a normal pulse
rate is between 50

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:90%
and 80 beats per minute.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%
So establish your pulse rate.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Then, you do the challenge test,
which is to consume the food,

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
wait 20 minutes, and
test your pulse again.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And if your pulse is
raised by 10 or more beats,

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
then your body does not
want that substance.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a challenge test.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It's one single
substance at a time.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
ways to learn how to tune

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
into our instincts
and how to find out

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:90%
what things are right for us.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:84%
When we come back
from the break,

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.890 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
explore a little bit

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:84%
about our own physical types
based on our backgrounds

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and how we can tune into
that intuition as to what

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:84%
would be a food allergy for
us or typical sensitivities

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.689 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
go through that we

00:23:20.689 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:84%
come back with my guest
Caroline Sutherland.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll be right back.
This is Lisa Garr.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
Gaiam Inspirations.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.670 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.451 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:23:46.451 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And my guest is medical
intuitive Caroline Sutherland.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about how to
be your own medical intuitive.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:84%
How to be your own
health detective.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone through some
really great techniques.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I just want to share one
more thing with the audience

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
fun one, is Carolyn

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
teaches how to tune
into inanimate objects,

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
how to read the
energy of off objects,

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.730 align:middle line:84%
if someone were to
give you a bracelet.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is then
something that you've

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.190 align:middle line:84%
taught for years to detectives,
to find missing children,

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and it's fascinating.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Well I haven't
taught any detectives.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a method that
[INAUDIBLE] detectives.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's a psychic who
holds an object, perhaps,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:90%
belonging to a missing child.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And they can tune in.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And they might be able to
tell where that child is.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But basically, you
can take anything.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:10%
A bracelet, a set of keys,
anything that belongs

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:10%
to a person, and tune into it.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.420 align:middle line:10%
And it depends what
you're tuning into.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:10%
I teach people to
tune into what they

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:10%
love to do because
if you ask somebody

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:10%
to tune into that person,
they might pick up something

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:10%
that could be more serious.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:10%
So I keep it kind of light.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:10%
And it really helps people
to really do the exercise

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:10%
without getting too deep
into emotional pains

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:10%
and all of that kind of thing.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I teach them to do a way of
tuning into what the person

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.677 align:middle line:84%
loves, and what their
life is all about,

00:24:59.677 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
passionate about.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.714 align:middle line:90%
That's just interesting.

00:25:01.714 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
things you could do.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
talking about today

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:84%
is how to use these abilities
to tune into your own health

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:84%
challenges and how to tune into
things like even for the right

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
supplements to
take for your body

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
or what that physical
pain is and, as I

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.471 align:middle line:84%
said earlier, to create
a dialogue with the body.

00:25:17.471 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So you've created
something that

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
has to do with systems
with types of people,

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.387 align:middle line:90%
and backgrounds, and origins.

00:25:25.387 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.419 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Well as an allergy
testing technician

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
in the clinical setting, I
saw thousands of patients.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And the first test that we
did in the clinical setting

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.840 align:middle line:84%
with something
called a pre-test.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And it showed where the doctor
wanted to do further testing.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered over
the years of doing

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that that certain people
fit into certain categories.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating that
certain types of people

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
had many similar problems and
other types had other problems.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was based a lot
on their ethnicity.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.650 align:middle line:90%
So I call it system types.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.511 align:middle line:84%
And it's all related to my
background in allergy testing.

00:26:04.511 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go
through some of these.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And give some examples.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well the first one is the
central nervous system type.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:10%
And that's the person who's
light skin, light hair,

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.660 align:middle line:10%
they usually have blue
eyes or green eyes.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:10%
That would be me.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:10%
And I'm a central
nervous system type.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:10%
And there are lots of
people that you know

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:10%
that are Caucasian,
and they come from

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:10%
northern European background.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:10%
They might be
Scandinavian or British.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:10%
They would fit
into that category.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:10%
And so, with them, you have
to be really careful of them

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:36.540 align:middle line:10%
with stimulants.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:10%
They don't do well
with caffeine at all.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:10%
They don't do well
with chocolate.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:10%
They don't do well with
anything that's caffeinated.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's a stimulant,
they do not respond well.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:10%
They usually tax adrenals.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.070 align:middle line:10%
Now energetically, what's
interesting with those people

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:10%
is that they are very
productivity oriented.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:90%
They always see the end goal.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:90%
They will always do.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And they will say yes
when they should say no.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
people that really

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:90%
expand power give power away.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So they become quite
depleted quite early.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And they don't do
well, as far as blood

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:90%
sugar handling is concerned.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:84%
That's almost one of
their biggest issues.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:90%
And they need grounding.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They need protein
consistently through the day.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.110 align:middle line:90%
They do very well with calcium.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
They often really
respond to being

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
on or near water
because they're quite

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:90%
fragile in many, many ways.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
strength and the robustness

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of other
people do from

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:90%
different other ethnic origins.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's the central
nervous system type.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.310 align:middle line:90%
Very common type.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So what is a good diet
for someone like that?

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Well they need grounding.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to have to have
protein at every single meal

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.320 align:middle line:90%
and every single snack.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, they don't
do well with sugar.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And they don't do
well with stimulants.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And do they need
to eat more often?

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Yes, probably more often
they have a tendency

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
for hypoglycemia, which is
low blood sugar and blood

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.900 align:middle line:90%
sugar handling issues.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So they do need to
eat more frequently.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you say this person
is a central nervous system,

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
is sleep a challenge
for this person?

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Well it would depend.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Each person's a
little bit different.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Sleep is not necessary the
first and foremost thing.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you help to
balance the body,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.630 align:middle line:90%
then they will sleep better.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But it depends
what age they are.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:90%
They could be menopausal.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, they're going
to have sleep issues.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:90%
So everyone's different.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's a category that shows
me they've expended power.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:90%
They've invested.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
They're very invested in
people, places, and things

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:22.930 align:middle line:90%
outside of themselves.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:84%
They're rarely in
the present moment.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:84%
They're ruminating
about the past.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:90%
They should have done this.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:90%
They should have done that.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Or they're projected
into the future.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They're rarely in
the present moment.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they need to learn.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned, maybe,
eating before you go to sleep.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.691 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a small meal with
a little bit of protein.

00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
A few bites of any ol' kind of
protein you can get your hands

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
on just before
going to bed helps

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.120 align:middle line:90%
to balance those blood sugars.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:90%
To avoid that drop.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so another type of
system type of person.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Well the next
one is a digestive

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:90%
lymphatic hormonal type.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.720 align:middle line:10%
And that's someone that
has an ethnicity, usually

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:10%
from an African American
ancestry, Native American,

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:10%
Hispanic, Polynesian,
people from India,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:10%
they fit into that category.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:10%
And their biggest issue, as
far as digestion is concerned,

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.060 align:middle line:10%
is milk products.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.760 align:middle line:10%
They don't do well with
milk products at all.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:10%
And they don't do
well with caffeine

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:10%
because, both, the milk and
the caffeine affect the lymph.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.430 align:middle line:10%
And the lymph on a metaphysical
level is related to release

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:10%
and letting go.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.310 align:middle line:10%
And often, if they
have an ethnicity

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:10%
and they start to integrate
into a new culture,

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.300 align:middle line:10%
they carry a lot of emotion.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
They carry the past and all
of the-- well how should

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I say-- the
misunderstanding about them

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and the lack of real
validation for them as people.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And they carry that.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:90%
So this affects the lymph.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:90%
So exercise is great.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Not using caffeinated products.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Not using milk products is
really helpful for them.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But the cornerstone for a
digestive lymphatic hormonal

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.570 align:middle line:90%
person is hormones.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can be out of balance
hormonally at a very young age,

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:90%
especially thyroid.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So you said the tendency
for this background

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.470 align:middle line:90%
is African American, Asian.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Native American, Hispanic.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Middle Eastern.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Middle Eastern and
Hispanic and Polynesian.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So if someone from
that background

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:middle line:84%
were to come to America and
start eating hamburgers,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and pizza, and sandwiches,
they would most likely

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:84%
have experiences of food
intolerances or allergies,

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and we see that.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the
students, for example,

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that come from Japan
and China and Korea

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:90%
to study here in the west.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
diet that's largely

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%
rice, protein, and vegetables.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And they come here, and
they're into ice cream,

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and potato chips, and pizza.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Their skin breaks out.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.040 align:middle line:90%
They gain weight.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They get lethargic, and
they can't figure it out.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It's usually, pretty
much, straight up.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I see someone from
Asia and they come to me,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I look at them, and
I will say just get

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:90%
right back on the Asian diet.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And you watch your
health will turn around.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting for
them, characteristically.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing, though,
that those foods

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.830 align:middle line:84%
would actually create
these thyroid imbalances.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.611 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really go to and do
a lot of damage to the body.

00:31:10.611 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Especially an
intolerance to dairy.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The body creates an
immune system response.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:90%
The white blood cells increase.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really does create a
cascade of effects in the body.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Well some people can handle
dairy products, especially

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:90%
when they're cultured.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, cottage cheese,
or sour cream, or cheese, for

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:90%
some people, can be tolerated.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:84%
But for most people the
milk, before it's cultured,

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.250 align:middle line:90%
is a problem.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And after all,
we're not baby cows.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
don't tolerate milk.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:84%
How many people in your
practice in your experience

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:84%
of the 155,000 people
that you have seen

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
are dairy intolerant,
specifically milk?

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Well I'd want to
say pretty high.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.051 align:middle line:84%
99 point something.
-Really?

00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:84%
-It's high.
-Wow.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes.
It's very, very high.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Wheat is almost on a par.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Dairy and wheat are the
two biggest sensitivities.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Why now, though?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:84%
We have eaten those
foods for centuries.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
the immune system.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It's related to stress.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.660 align:middle line:90%
We can't handle those things.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And we can't handle
them in large amounts.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.640 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the capacity.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting
to, in effect,

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.150 align:middle line:90%
crater out and start to react.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Many people are becoming what's
called universal reactors.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.995 align:middle line:84%
And they're reacting
to all sorts of things

00:32:18.995 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:84%
that, 10 years ago,
we wouldn't react to.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But what about babies that
are given bottles of milk?

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're not
having a lot of stress.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to have
allergic reactions.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Well they've developed
the allergy from the mother

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:84%
through the breast milk
or even being in utero.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:84%
They're exposed to
those foods in utero.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And they arrive
here in the world

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and start to
consume those foods.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're already intolerant
before they were born.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is because I
believe that mothers now--

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.560 align:middle line:84%
we have three
generations of mothers--

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.980 align:middle line:90%
that are weak themselves.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And the babies are
coming in weak.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're more reactive
because the mothers

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.390 align:middle line:90%
are not strong.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Their immune systems are weak.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.380 align:middle line:90%
So it passes through.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Do excessive food
intolerances, when you're not

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
paying attention
to them, can they

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
cause things like overgrowth of
yeast, infections in the body,

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.830 align:middle line:84%
causing weight
gain and so forth.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:15.210 align:middle line:84%
We talked a lot about the
fact that so many more

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.720 align:middle line:84%
people these days are--
what, two and three you said

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.880 align:middle line:90%
are overweight?

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.704 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:21.704 --> 00:33:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Well on and three
people are over weight.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.469 align:middle line:84%
-Is obese, yeah.
-Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:25.260 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE], OK.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
I find interesting

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.400 align:middle line:84%
is that the body is giving
us signals and signs.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And it will tell us that it
doesn't like what we're doing.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And what you end up with is
somebody that is actually

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.350 align:middle line:84%
addicted to a certain
food, and they're

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.670 align:middle line:90%
actually allergic to it.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like somebody
that smoke cigarettes.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.180 align:middle line:84%
They have such an addiction
that, if they withdraw,

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:90%
they go into withdrawal.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
all these symptoms.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So they have to actually
keep eating the food

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:84%
or keep smoking cigarettes
in order to avoid withdrawal.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.080 align:middle line:90%
And I teach.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I do three detox
programs a year.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:90%
They're all done by telephone.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And during that one week,
I take everyone off all

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.540 align:middle line:90%
offending foods for seven days.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.909 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't
believe, in seven

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:90%
days, what happens to people.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Their energy comes up.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:84%
They start to
think more clearly.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Their skin issues back off.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Their digestive issues go
away, even in seven days.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So it shows what the
body's capable of.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But do they go through a
detox effect in the beginning?

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they'll go
through withdrawal.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:90%
Not all of them.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.219 align:middle line:90%
Depends how toxic they are.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.929 align:middle line:84%
But they will go through
withdrawal, three or four days,

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:84%
where they feel kind of achy
and a little stiff, and really

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:84%
tired, and just a
little grumpy and moody,

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.100 align:middle line:90%
thus a detox reaction.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.500 align:middle line:90%
But it quickly shifts.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
About the fifth day,
it starts to shift out.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.139 align:middle line:90%
Some are a little longer.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, they start to
have a spring in their step.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.230 align:middle line:90%
And they feel good.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's so exciting.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's so rewarding.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's so evident what
the body is capable of.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So going back to
the system types,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.921 align:middle line:84%
what happens if someone has
multiple ethnic backgrounds?

00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That's called a
combination type.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:10%
And these are people that
might have a little Italian.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:10%
They might have a
little Hispanic.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:12.040 align:middle line:10%
Maybe their mother's English.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.580 align:middle line:10%
And they have this mixture.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.560 align:middle line:10%
You have to address all
systems in that case.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:10%
You have to address
hormones because they

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:10%
might have Hispanic.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.630 align:middle line:10%
And you have to address
the thyroid, which,

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:10%
of course, is a huge problem.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.510 align:middle line:10%
And then, you balance
them exactly the same

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.070 align:middle line:10%
as you would for a
central nervous system

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:30.080 align:middle line:10%
type, which is blood
sugar handling,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.310 align:middle line:10%
mostly, and taxed adrenal.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So the balancing is
there for everyone.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But for people that are
trying to learn this,

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.710 align:middle line:84%
if you see someone, this kind of
a mixture, and you're thinking,

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.290 align:middle line:84%
well, what could they be,
they're combination type.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So you learn to
do the balancing.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.677 align:middle line:84%
And my Body Knows books do
teach people how to do that.

00:35:48.677 --> 00:35:50.209 align:middle line:84%
-How to do the balancing.
-Yes.

00:35:50.209 --> 00:35:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
I said earlier

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.410 align:middle line:84%
is everybody is different.
-Yes.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But if we can learn to
tune into our own bodies

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and find out and, of course,
based on some of these systems

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.430 align:middle line:84%
types that you're talking
about would give us

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:02.800 align:middle line:84%
guidelines on where to start
and then, to be able to tune

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:90%
into ourselves.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
somebody is out of balance

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:09.980 align:middle line:84%
if, say, for example,
they're a combination type,

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and they're eating the
wrong foods, what happens?

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Well they can gain weight.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.950 align:middle line:84%
They can start to
have hair loss.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.882 align:middle line:84%
They can have all kinds of
different joint stiffness

00:36:20.882 --> 00:36:21.582 align:middle line:90%
and changes.

00:36:21.582 --> 00:36:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the imbalances are so
calm and they're universal.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.262 align:middle line:84%
And the way we know that
they're common and universal

00:36:29.262 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:90%
is by looking at advertising.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch any
amount of television--

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:84%
not Gaiam TV, which, of course,
is the kind of television you

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:41.200 align:middle line:84%
should be watching but
conventional network

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:84%
television, you'll see
in a matter of an hour

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.990 align:middle line:84%
all the advertising for
the different common health

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:84%
ailments that we have
across the country.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So we know that there's
common illnesses

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
solutions for these that

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:90%
are practical and workable.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's not something esoteric.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that's far afield.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.254 align:middle line:84%
It's right there at hand.
-That's interesting.

00:37:05.254 --> 00:37:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it's a
relationship between the person

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:90%
and the fork.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And once you get that
relationship established,

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.940 align:middle line:84%
then things start
to go a lot better.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:84%
We have an example
here that you gave us

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
a picture of
somebody who is doing

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.665 align:middle line:84%
an advertisement for dairy
and a sugary type of product.

00:37:21.665 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, yes.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is a person who is
in balance or out of balance?

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Well he's out of
balance already

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
because he's got a little bit of
extra weight around his waist.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, what I try to teach
is, that particular food

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.770 align:middle line:84%
that he's about to eat, would
that help him or hinder him?

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So we know that milk
products are a very common

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.620 align:middle line:90%
sensitivity in our culture.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So what will happen
from that milk product

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:84%
is he's going to gain
weight from that.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to have
a histamine reaction,

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.780 align:middle line:84%
which is an immune
reaction, to the food

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:90%
that he's intolerant to.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So he's actually
going to gain weight,

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.070 align:middle line:90%
which is a storage of fluid.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:03.075 align:middle line:84%
And then, with the blueberries
that are in that little kind

00:38:03.075 --> 00:38:05.330 align:middle line:90%
of package, that's a sugar.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.870 align:middle line:90%
So what's that going to do?

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.010 align:middle line:90%
That's going to spike insulin.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.320 align:middle line:84%
He's going to want
more sugar from that.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to add
on to this layer of fat

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.410 align:middle line:90%
that he has around his waist.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
because someone would

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.220 align:middle line:90%
think that's a healthy product.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:90%
It's cottage cheese.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, actually,
the wrong product

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.680 align:middle line:90%
for specific body types.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:90%
For certain people.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Other people might do
fine with cottage cheese

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.620 align:middle line:90%
because it is a milk product.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It is cultured.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.320 align:middle line:90%
It has protein.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And has protein
and some people can

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:90%
manage with it, not everyone.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And alas, and even the amount
that I've seen, not that many.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Well you also have to
look for if it's organic,

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:84%
if it's not laden with sugar and
outside preservatives, as well.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.460 align:middle line:90%
And hormones.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Milk products have
hormones in them,

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:51.290 align:middle line:84%
which is why we have a lot of
obesity and very tall people

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and tall children because of
the amount of hormone material

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:56.340 align:middle line:84%
that people are
ingesting, unless they're

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.600 align:middle line:90%
doing organic and hormone free.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed that there
is a specific ethnicity

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:84%
or background that is
specifically allergic to milk,

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.270 align:middle line:84%
or dairy products,
or various things

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that they should
absolutely stay away from?

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Well I would say the African
American culture, for sure.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at their background,

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.785 align:middle line:84%
they don't have milk
in their culture.

00:39:18.785 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:90%
You know, in Africa.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:90%
There's no cow's milk.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:90%
There is only one basic tribe.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's the Kikuyu tribe.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.381 align:middle line:84%
And that's in Kenya where
I grew up as a little girl.

00:39:28.381 --> 00:39:30.680 align:middle line:84%
-Really?
-And they raise cattle.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.644 align:middle line:84%
But in larger parts
of Africa, there

00:39:33.644 --> 00:39:34.610 align:middle line:90%
are no cows and no cows milk.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:84%
They raise cattle, but
they don't drink milk?

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:90%
They do drink milk.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to tell you
what they add to the milk.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But they add a type of
a protein to the milk.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And let's just leave it at that.
-OK.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's what's
causing the allergy?

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:84%
No, I was just going
to say that I would say

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.130 align:middle line:84%
African American people have the
worst time with dairy products.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.529 align:middle line:84%
-OK, I see.
-Yes.

00:39:54.529 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now you had shown
us a picture of a woman who

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.910 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what she had these
specific types of allergies

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and who didn't
understand that there

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:07.690 align:middle line:90%
was sensitivities in her body.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.054 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something
that, amongst children,

00:40:10.054 --> 00:40:12.120 align:middle line:84%
this particular person is young,
right, that we're looking at.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:12.861 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:12.861 --> 00:40:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
you're talking about.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Digestive lymphatic
hormonal type.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
study that was done.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.200 align:middle line:90%
It was the Philadelphia study.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was for young,
teenage mothers.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked at a picture
of these teenage mothers that

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.680 align:middle line:84%
were there at a program
to try and build

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.710 align:middle line:84%
self-esteem and help them
to get orientated as far

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.970 align:middle line:90%
as jobs were concerned.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I thought, how sad
that nobody really

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.900 align:middle line:84%
pinpointed their sensitivities
and potential thyroid

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.820 align:middle line:90%
imbalances.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
lots that can be done.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm just one person
but if there are

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
people that are involved
in these kinds of programs

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:48.809 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:40:48.809 --> 00:40:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you should see
the diets of these people.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.180 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Well that's what
we're here for people

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.960 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to understand
this and to clear this up.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:56.750 align:middle line:84%
You actually go
as far as to say

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:58.580 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
tell somebody

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.313 align:middle line:84%
by looking at their photograph.
-Yes.

00:41:00.313 --> 00:41:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And is that something that
you teach, to be able to look?

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I do.
I love to teach that.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:84%
You can tell their physical
and emotional issues

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.550 align:middle line:90%
by looking at a picture?

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Well what I do is
I teach in my class.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Everyone brings
three photographs.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And I like a one single
photograph of a person.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I show them how to
work with quadrants.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:84%
They put the head of the
person in the photograph

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.750 align:middle line:84%
against a full body picture
of the body, just an outline,

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and different quadrants.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:27.010 align:middle line:90%
You know, the head quadrant.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, this part, and this
part, and the lower quadrant.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, they use a pendulum,
and go through each quadrant,

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and ask is there an
issue or a concern

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.170 align:middle line:84%
in this part of so and
so, Fred, or whatever

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:38.889 align:middle line:84%
the person's name is body.
-Interesting.

00:41:38.889 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And the pendulum will
tell them, yes, there is.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So they go through
the whole body

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:84%
scan and check to see if there's
a yes or a no problem area.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, in the problem
area, I teach them what

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.030 align:middle line:90%
could be the problem there.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.941 align:middle line:84%
So if it's in this area,
digestion, it could be stomach.

00:41:54.941 --> 00:41:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it stomach?
Yes or no.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it pancreas?

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.399 align:middle line:84%
Yes or no.
Is it liver?

00:41:58.399 --> 00:41:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Is this a food allergy?
Yes or no.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Is this an absorption issue?

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they can pick
up a lot of information

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.685 align:middle line:84%
from that photograph just
using that scanning technique.

00:42:08.685 --> 00:42:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who's
child is autistic.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And she uses this muscle
testing on her all of the time

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.360 align:middle line:84%
because her body chemistry
changes so often that she

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.430 align:middle line:84%
needs to test certain
foods to see if one

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.420 align:middle line:90%
week she's eating chicken.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:84%
The next week, she might
not be able to test

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.310 align:middle line:84%
fall for that chicken.
-That's right.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.820 align:middle line:84%
It's so unique and
so interesting.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And the testing should be done,
literally, on a daily basis

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.360 align:middle line:90%
because the body is changing.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.660 align:middle line:90%
One week, rice is fine.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Next week, rice
is out, you know.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not just a
given every single time.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very helpful.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have another friend
who, every time you mention,

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.170 align:middle line:84%
oh, you should try
this new thing,

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.130 align:middle line:84%
automatically she
gets the answer

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.434 align:middle line:84%
whether or not she's going to
go down that rabbit hole or not.

00:42:45.434 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:84%
She's just using the
little circle testing.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So she can tune in right away
to discover if there's a reason

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to go after talking
with a certain person,

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:56.871 align:middle line:84%
or reading a certain book,
or going after a course.

00:42:56.871 --> 00:42:57.570 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But you had asked
about emotions.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And when people are
looking for optimum health,

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:84%
they have to have a really
strong emotional body

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and be really connected
spiritually and really

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.560 align:middle line:90%
knowing who they are.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Really just standing in
their own power and knowing I

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.280 align:middle line:90%
am this person.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.401 align:middle line:84%
And so as a person stands
in their own power,

00:43:15.401 --> 00:43:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and as they're
strong and as they're

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.070 align:middle line:84%
passionate about
what they're doing,

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be healthy.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to have
a lot less health problems

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.095 align:middle line:84%
than people that are mired
in emotions from the past

00:43:24.095 --> 00:43:26.650 align:middle line:84%
or they're really just
laboring with a lot

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.030 align:middle line:90%
of emotional difficulties.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:84%
As you're doing the testing and
you're tuning in and so forth

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.490 align:middle line:84%
on other people, does that
help if you are yourself

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:35.520 align:middle line:90%
strong and emotional body?

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.734 align:middle line:90%
Oh, very much so.

00:43:36.734 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I can do this--

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.833 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
be clear yourself.

00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:40.900 align:middle line:84%
--at this level, unless I
had this level of strength.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm really fortunate.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't find that people
deposit their energy into me.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't pick up
anything from people.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
I've refined over the years.

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Years and years of practice.
-Yes, exactly.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But it does help if
the vessel is clear

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.180 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to
intuit others so that there's

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.450 align:middle line:90%
no impact on there.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Well there's a great
video that I want to show

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:90%
you of Caroline and her work.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's called The Body Knows.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And it'll give you a
great insight into how

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Carolyn works with people
and uses medical intuition.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:16.340 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Think about your body.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:22.989 align:middle line:90%
Are you happy with how you look?

00:44:22.989 --> 00:44:26.693 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.693 --> 00:44:27.605 align:middle line:90%
How you feel?

00:44:27.605 --> 00:44:32.504 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The attainment of
physical health,

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and vitality, and stamina,
and vibrancy is not a mystery.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:43.680 align:middle line:84%
The people you are about
to see are not actors.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.670 align:middle line:90%
These are their true stories.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:50.120 align:middle line:90%
My body was just sluggish.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.400 align:middle line:90%
My hands hurt.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.400 align:middle line:90%
My feet hurt.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Tremendous physical fatigue,
as well as my mental clarity

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.550 align:middle line:90%
was, kind of, shot.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.540 align:middle line:84%
The fat between
my legs would rub.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.070 align:middle line:90%
And then, I'd get blisters.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I was in a desperate
physical state.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.390 align:middle line:90%
I really needed some help.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.568 align:middle line:84%
What happens when your
child's health suffers?

00:45:08.568 --> 00:45:13.727 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.727 --> 00:45:16.610 align:middle line:84%
One morning, my wife called
me hysterical from home.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And she said the sheets
are soaked in blood.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Pediatrician immediately
wrote down on the chart

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.720 align:middle line:90%
chronic failure to thrive.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The diagnosis the doctors gave
us was agonizing that this was

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.238 align:middle line:84%
going to be a life
long condition

00:45:30.238 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and to tell us that
there was no hope.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.943 align:middle line:84%
It's all because of one woman.
Caroline.

00:45:34.943 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Internationally
recognized author

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and well respected medical
intuitive, Caroline Sutherland.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm knowing this.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm knowing this.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know why
I had that knowing.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.690 align:middle line:90%
But I knew I had it.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.410 align:middle line:84%
When you first come
up to Caroline,

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.170 align:middle line:84%
it's really kind of
interesting because you

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:00.860 align:middle line:90%
don't know what to experience.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.160 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like she walks into your
body, and then walks back out.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:06.890 align:middle line:90%
She didn't examine my son.

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:08.380 align:middle line:90%
She just looked at him.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And she gave this
no nonsense advice

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:13.430 align:middle line:90%
how we can help heal him.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.940 align:middle line:90%
It was always practical.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It was never something
mysterious and esoteric.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I always knew that
there was a foundation,

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.690 align:middle line:84%
a practical foundation, for
the intuitive impressions.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Once we started, it was so easy.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.180 align:middle line:90%
It was nothing to it.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just very normal
and natural for me.

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.510 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing fancy or glowing
and glowing lights about it.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:37.560 align:middle line:90%
It's just normal.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.496 align:middle line:90%
This is just how it comes to me.

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:41.686 align:middle line:84%
Look at how their lives
have been transformed.

00:46:41.686 --> 00:46:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:54.320 align:middle line:84%
In 4 1/2 months, I've
lost 30 plus pounds.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching myself
just melt away becoming

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.020 align:middle line:90%
the new me, the real me.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:90%
It has changed my life.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:90%
I owe her my life.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I am thrilled to
feel so much better

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.110 align:middle line:84%
physically, mentally,
emotionally and, therefore,

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:12.806 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:47:12.806 --> 00:47:15.410 align:middle line:84%
In one week, there was
something in my son's eyes,

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:17.080 align:middle line:90%
something in his reaction.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:17.900 align:middle line:90%
And I saw it.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, there's a sparkle.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.980 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have that
dullness anymore.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.800 align:middle line:90%
And one week later, I knew.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.950 align:middle line:84%
She also told us, in one
month, it'll all be a memory.

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:35.184 align:middle line:84%
And four weeks later,
it was just a memory.

00:47:35.184 --> 00:47:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I can see
it in their body

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.610 align:middle line:90%
that their body has the health.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:40.610 align:middle line:90%
It has the vitality.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It has the capability
of being able to make

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.470 align:middle line:84%
the switch if they
will do it, and if they

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.542 align:middle line:90%
have the practical tools.

00:47:48.542 --> 00:47:50.860 align:middle line:84%
The attainment of
physical health,

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:56.602 align:middle line:84%
and vitality, and stamina,
and vibrancy is not a mystery.

00:47:56.602 --> 00:47:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It's there for
every single person.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:90%


00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.300 align:middle line:84%
You really are doing
great, great work.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And teaching us to be
able to do this ourselves

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:90%
is very empowering.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.520 align:middle line:90%
And I really appreciate this.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.740 align:middle line:10%
How is it for you, as a medical
intuitive, as you're walking

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:17.460 align:middle line:10%
through malls, or places, or
if someone who is sick or toxic

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.320 align:middle line:10%
walks by you?

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.410 align:middle line:10%
Do you feel that you want to
reach out and help that person?

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.720 align:middle line:10%
Over the years, have you
learned to turn it on and off?

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.580 align:middle line:10%
Well with this gift, you
have to be discerning.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:29.570 align:middle line:10%
You can't come up to somebody
and say this would help you,

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.710 align:middle line:10%
or I see this or I see that.

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:33.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm very careful about that.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.910 align:middle line:10%
That's important.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.810 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really lucky that
I don't pick up energy.

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't open this up, unless
it's the appropriate time.

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.670 align:middle line:84%
If I'm working, and I'm
doing a bunch of readings,

00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.290 align:middle line:84%
or an individual reading, or I'm
speaking in front of a group,

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:90%
that's when I'll open it up.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.490 align:middle line:90%
And I don't otherwise.

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I might open it up
on my teleconference

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.074 align:middle line:90%
or I might on my radio show.

00:48:53.074 --> 00:48:54.839 align:middle line:84%
-Where you have more permission.
-Yes.

00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Well it's more like
where's it going to go.

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm able to open it
up and shut it down.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.980 align:middle line:90%
So for that, I'm very grateful.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.789 align:middle line:84%
-Very level-headed about it.
-Yes.

00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But yet, there's
people where you

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.830 align:middle line:90%
can sense that they are open.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:08.920 align:middle line:84%
If you say something,
you could impact

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.350 align:middle line:90%
their life in a great way.

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:11.370 align:middle line:90%
It just depends.

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Each case is different.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.190 align:middle line:90%
No, I understand.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I like it when they
come to me and ask.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Well we've learned a lot.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:20.420 align:middle line:84%
We have definitely learned about
how to read our own intuition,

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.980 align:middle line:84%
how to trust our own
instincts, and what

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.790 align:middle line:90%
it feels like to move into us.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.261 align:middle line:84%
So the main thing that we've
learned is, first of all,

00:49:27.261 --> 00:49:28.350 align:middle line:84%
detoxify.
-Yes.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So if we find something
and that we're intolerant to

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.570 align:middle line:84%
or that we have as an imbalance
in our body, we have to,

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.061 align:middle line:84%
first, detoxify that
substance out of the body.

00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Well I would say, for
detoxification, the idea if you

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.130 align:middle line:84%
really want to develop
your intuition,

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.930 align:middle line:90%
be a lot less toxic physically.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:48.350 align:middle line:84%
In other words, take the
junk out of the diet.

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Keep it very
minimal in the diet.

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And become healthy and strong.

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
first prerequisite.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:84%
The second prerequisite is
to be emotionally detoxified.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, anything
that were hanging onto.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Any anger,
resentment, the issues

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.880 align:middle line:84%
from the past to emotionally
detoxify, as well.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Those two things
will help and enhance

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.924 align:middle line:90%
your intuitive abilities.

00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And meditation helps
with something like that.

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Every day a meditative practice.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.951 align:middle line:84%
Just something simple,
like we talked about.

00:50:15.951 --> 00:50:16.650 align:middle line:90%
The I am.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:17.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, the I
am and then a word.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:19.150 align:middle line:90%
The word that feels right.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:21.030 align:middle line:84%
On a daily basis just
for a few minutes.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
a laborious practice

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.350 align:middle line:84%
where you're
sitting cross legged

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:25.620 align:middle line:90%
and doing anything fancy.

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:27.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just something simple
that takes you down,

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.870 align:middle line:90%
so you can really listen.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when you do listen,
you said those words show me,

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:32.850 align:middle line:90%
show me. show me.

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Well I just talk to the universe
and say, OK, show me now.

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:38.571 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm here with this person.
Show me.

00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Show me.
What do I need to do?

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to see here?

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.490 align:middle line:90%
And so I co-create.

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are all co-creating
every moment with the universe

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:47.220 align:middle line:90%
with the divine.

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So you really align
with that energy.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, you
get into that gap.

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, you listen where
the thoughts are clear,

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.081 align:middle line:84%
and it's not busy,
and you just listen.

00:50:55.081 --> 00:50:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
You listen, and you hear it.

00:50:57.030 --> 00:51:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next
thing is acting upon it.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So wisdom and guidance
is the first part.

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:03.890 align:middle line:90%
The second part is act upon it.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you receive,
you act upon it.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.630 align:middle line:90%
And trust your hunch.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:09.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
when I teach them

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have them tuning
into another person,

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, you
know, I got a sense

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.700 align:middle line:90%
of whatever the thing was.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But I, kind of, blocked it
because it seemed strange.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:20.290 align:middle line:84%
No, it may seem
strange, so you just

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:24.770 align:middle line:84%
say this seems a little strange,
but I sense a blue scarf

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:27.100 align:middle line:90%
or a blue gate or something.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.924 align:middle line:84%
And don't block it
because, sure enough,

00:51:28.924 --> 00:51:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that person, when you discuss
it with them, they'll say,

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:34.120 align:middle line:84%
well, I do have a blue gate or I
do wear a blue scarf, you know.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And we block it because
we don't trust it.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:39.180 align:middle line:84%
What if you block
it intentionally

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.830 align:middle line:84%
where I could tune in and
say coffee's not good for me,

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:45.090 align:middle line:90%
but I really love that coffee?

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Well it's your intention.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Your intention is to be
the best that you can be

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and to be as healthy as you
can be because you've been

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.450 align:middle line:90%
given one body for one life.

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if your body is
trying to give you a message,

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.500 align:middle line:90%
then you honor the body.

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.370 align:middle line:84%
You say, OK, well
thank you so much.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And you respect
it because you're

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.755 align:middle line:90%
part of the great unfolding.

00:52:02.755 --> 00:52:04.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, the healing
pattern and the healing

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.100 align:middle line:90%
plan for the planet.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.840 align:middle line:90%
So there's a great payoff.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to be a lot more

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.010 align:middle line:90%
energy and a lot more vitality.

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.825 align:middle line:84%
Just like you have, which
you are a great example of.

00:52:13.825 --> 00:52:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I do have it.
I don't drink coffee.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.700 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't help me.
-You don't.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.410 align:middle line:84%
If you think I'm
buzzed right now,

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:21.790 align:middle line:84%
you give me a cup of coffee,
and I think I'd be just

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:23.120 align:middle line:90%
running a circles all around.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.341 align:middle line:84%
You have so much
natural energy.

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:26.230 align:middle line:84%
-I do, actually.
-You really walk your talk.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.140 align:middle line:90%
You're so great.

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.970 align:middle line:84%
It comes through that you really
do practice what you teach.

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much for
being that example to us

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and for all the information.
-Thank you, Lisa.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.166 align:middle line:90%
And thank you everyone.

00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:36.420 align:middle line:90%

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.160 align:middle line:90%
