00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle line:10%
If you care what's happening
to the Earth's oceans,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.710 align:middle line:10%
then pay close
attention to this show.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.870 align:middle line:10%
My guest, Patricia Cori,
is a powerful voice

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
for our Earth's oceans.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:10%
She's been called the
real life Indiana Jones

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:10%
by fans and readers
around the world.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
And Patricia has written a
novel called "The Emissary,"

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:10%
and it's filled with many
truths revealed through fiction.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PATRICIA CORI: Oh, thank you.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.587 align:middle line:84%
It is great to be
with you above all.

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm excited.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to call you
the Anna Jones.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: All right.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Anna Jones.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The female
Indiana Jones.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.044 align:middle line:90%
So why do people call you that?

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: You know, I don't
know where I got that tag.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:10%
Somewhere way back in the media,
and possibly a few travelers

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:10%
who have come with me on
some of my sacred journeys.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:10%
But I think it
comes from the fact

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:10%
that I'm climbing
around pyramids,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:10%
I've been in places where
most people can't go,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:10%
I locked myself into a
temple in Abydos, Egypt

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:10%
for five hours in
the dark so that I

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.049 align:middle line:10%
could meet the spirits there.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.131 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did you meet them?

00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: I did.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.723 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: I did.

00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
It's in my book "Where Pharaohs
Dwell," which is such a story.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: And I've been crawling
around under the Great Pyramid

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:10%
and hanging off cliffs.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:10%
And you wouldn't think so,
because I'm not exactly

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:10%
a spring chicken,
but I still do it.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.655 align:middle line:10%
I'm fascinated by what
the world has to offer.

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:10%
What is that calling that
calls you towards the ocean

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:10%
and towards the sacred sites?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I have always--
as a young woman,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I started traveling
when I was really young.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, who
was a great visionary,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
said, live this planet,
live this life, honey.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Go for the gusto.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've always just been drawn
to walk to a different drummer.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And I go to places that
are rich in culture.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:10%
I think, also the
fact that I started

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:10%
traveling at a young age, when
cultures were very different,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:10%
because now it's sort of like
a McDonald's across the board.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.246 align:middle line:10%
But back in those days--

00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: It's gotten a little
bit more vanilla-ized.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.161 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: You got it.

00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.522 align:middle line:84%
It was so much different then,
and it just got into my blood.

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:16.647 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What was different?

00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:90%
What was different?

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: You-- for example I
live in Europe, and from country

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
to country now it really
looks all the same.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But back then in Amsterdam, they
still wore the wooden shoes.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:10%
In England, the
bobbies still looked--

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.690 align:middle line:10%
they didn't have
guns-- they still-- it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:10%
was just still
intact culturally.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:10%
And there was no Euro,
of course, which has also

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:10%
amalgamated so much-- and
that's just Europe, of course,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:10%
but-- You know, back in
those days people still

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:10%
wore their traditional clothing.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.359 align:middle line:90%
Egyptians still wore jellabiyas.

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They held
onto their culture.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Yeah.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was a beautiful
thing to experience.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
that because we've

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
lost a lot of that tradition
through these cultural shifts

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that it has added to
more of the devastation

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.279 align:middle line:84%
that you see in our
oceans and our planet?

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: I think so.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:10%
First of all, we know
that the transporting

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:10%
of goods, particularly
vegetables and food,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:10%
so that everybody has the
same food is killing us.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
It's killing us
because of the expense

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and the abuse of
fuel and things like

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.202 align:middle line:84%
that that are destroying
the atmosphere.

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you mean by
everybody having the same food?

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: Well, there was a time
when if you live in Italy,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
you do not have 100 choices
for vegetables and fruits.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And that still is true.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Italy still holds to its
tradition and to its food.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But to have bananas
from Ecuador and papaya

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
from Israel, this
kind of thing, this

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
means so much more
traffic, so much

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:90%
more air traffic or shipping.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is my
particular concern,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
because we know how
badly we're polluting

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.040 align:middle line:90%
the ocean and the sky.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:90%
A lot of both.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: So this globalization
is just not good for the planet.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You see it.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So what did you write
about in "The Emissary?"

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Is it a-- I mean, it's through
a fiction, and it's a novel,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.157 align:middle line:84%
but what's the truth that
you based the book on?

00:04:15.157 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: It's very
interesting that you

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:84%
ask that question
considering that one

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
of the events in "The Emissary,"
at the beginning of the book

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
has just happened
in Marina Del Rey,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and that is 70,000 to
100,000 fish floating

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the water, with
nobody understanding what's

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
In "The Emissary,"
the book starts out

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:90%
with three vignettes.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
The first is that a man
is driving home from work,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and as he stops to talk to
a friend in the road, 600,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:90%
700 blackbirds drop dead.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.223 align:middle line:90%
Blank.

00:04:44.223 --> 00:04:45.556 align:middle line:90%
Instantaneously, simultaneously.

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And this has happened
in Ohio recently,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's also happened in, I
think, Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:90%
So this is an unexplained event.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the second vignette
is that a woman walks out

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:84%
of her house in Maine
and sees 30,000,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:90%
40,000 fish strewn on the beach.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The story I heard was--
in the news-- about the fish

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.936 align:middle line:84%
was that there was an algae
that had blossomed, a spring

00:05:09.936 --> 00:05:11.435 align:middle line:84%
blossoming of an
algae that released

00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:13.552 align:middle line:90%
a toxin that killed the fish.

00:05:13.552 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I think that they
haven't proven that yet,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and that that's a hypothesis,
but as far as I understand

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:90%
it hasn't been proven yet.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And we do know that there
are all other possibilities,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
including some very strange,
perhaps weapons or things that

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:84%
have to do with waves--
electromagnetic waves--

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:90%
and we just don't know yet.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.713 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sonar frequencies.

00:05:33.713 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Sonar frequencies.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:10%
Although sonar is
probably more devastating

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:10%
to the marine mammals.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:10%
And this is a theme in
"The Emissary," absolutely.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.861 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Hasn't sonar
been outlawed yet?

00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: No.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:10%
What's happened is the Navy has
petitioned and gotten approval

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:10%
to do a five year program of
war exercises in the oceans,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.185 align:middle line:10%
in California particularly.

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: And they're going to be
sending very, very high powered

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.710 align:middle line:10%
sonar waves, laser
waves, bombs, chemicals,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.089 align:middle line:10%
whatever they want to
do in the Pacific Ocean.

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:90%
And they're going for it.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Five year plan.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Like our Pacific Ocean hasn't
been devastated enough.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And the marine
mammal sanctuaries

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:90%
are no longer protected.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're going for broke.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:10%
And this means a
lot of whale species

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:10%
are really already
threatened with extinction,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:10%
like the right whales.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:10%
And there's a right
whale sanctuary

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:10%
right in their target, and a
nursing-- birthing-- sanctuary

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.465 align:middle line:10%
that will be affected.

00:06:35.465 --> 00:06:38.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can't-- I mean, I know
that there's been laws that

00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:84%
have been attempted to
be passed around this,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and Greenpeace has done an
enormous amount of movement

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in this area in terms
of killing whales.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Can't there be anything done
to stop the sonar frequencies?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: Well, I'm certainly
speaking out about it,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:10%
and there are some
organizations that

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:10%
are doing their best to
petition against this.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Boxer was
someone that was

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.125 align:middle line:90%
involved in trying to stop this.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%
But it's going ahead.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:90%
It's the military.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.765 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have
awareness that we're

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
going to be bringing
about today.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And I want you take
a look at the trailer

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that Patricia has around her
book called "The Emissary."

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: Hi, everybody.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm Patricia Cori.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.167 align:middle line:10%
I hope a lot of you know me.

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:25.375 align:middle line:10%
And I'm here to talk to you
today about my new novel.

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm really excited-- my
first novel, actually.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.160 align:middle line:10%
It's called "The
Emissary," and it's

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:10%
just been released by
North Atlantic Books,

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:10%
and is also just released in
England, where I am currently

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:10%
preparing the concert for the
whales and dolphins entitled

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.220 align:middle line:10%
Singing the Oceans Alive, which
is my creation for Save Earth's

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.665 align:middle line:10%
Oceans, Inc., the newly formed
501(c) nonprofit organization

00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:10%
that I founded
two years ago now.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is our first big event.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:10%
And it's in great
timing with the release

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:10%
of "The Emissary,"
which is stirring up

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:10%
some excitement
and quite a buzz.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:10%
So, I hope that you
will look for it.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:10%
This is my 13th book,
although it's my first novel.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:10%
And I'm excited to report
that the book has already

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:10%
received an option from a
Hollywood producer, Global

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:10%
Universal Pictures, and so
we may be seeing it soon

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:10%
in film, which
thrills me to death.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the story of a
woman who becomes involved

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:84%
in a scene where 150 whales
and dolphins have beached

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:90%
themselves in New Zealand.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And she has an incredible
connection with one

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
of the whales, a humpback
whale who is dying,

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and she can sense that
this mother is pregnant.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And so she has a
psychic, if you will,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
connection with this
whale and her baby,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and it is a central
theme to the story.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
The story takes her
on a journey where

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:84%
she's asked by a
CEO of a oil company

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:84%
to go out on the ship that is
researching out in the Pacific

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
trying to find oil, and to
use her psychic talent so

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that-- with the
excuse that using

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.260 align:middle line:84%
her psychic vision, if
she can help them pinpoint

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:84%
the location, they can do
less damage to the ocean.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is of real concern to--
especially on the West Coast

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:84%
now, with all that's
going on in our oceans.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:10%
I think that it's very
important that we pay attention

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:10%
to what's really
going on out there.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:10%
I've brought my concerns through
my heroine, Jamie Hastings, who

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:10%
is determined to prevent any
further damage to the ocean,

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:10%
and by contributing to this oil
company perhaps, she believes,

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:10%
she can actually
prevent further damage.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not what it seems,
and soon this adventure

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:90%
takes a very different turn.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that occurs

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
is she starts getting messages
from the whales and dolphins,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and that is why, of course, the
book is titled "The Emissary."

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a very fast paced read.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
People are coming out
with some very exciting,

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
wonderful endorsements
of the book,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and calling it a book
that you cannot put down.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to see if
you agree with that.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So please pick up
"The Emissary."

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.905 align:middle line:84%
It is in fine
bookstores everywhere.

00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the internet.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't find it in
your bookstore, just say,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for "The
Emissary" by Patricia Cori,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.766 align:middle line:84%
and if they don't have it
they will certainly order it.

00:10:43.766 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to
hearing back from you.

me, and if you don't, here's

my website.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.704 align:middle line:10%
Let us know what you
think of the book.

And who knows, I might
just run into to you

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:10%
when I'm in San Francisco, or
Los Angeles, on the West Coast,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:10%
right where the story's
located, because it talks

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:10%
of damage to the
Western Seaboard.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:10%
It's about the Pacific Ocean.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.712 align:middle line:10%
It's about us.

[WAVES CRASHING]

00:11:12.052 --> 00:11:14.085 align:middle line:10%
And it's about all
the living creatures

00:11:14.085 --> 00:11:18.325 align:middle line:10%
of our oceans, all these
beautiful marine mammals.

00:11:18.325 --> 00:11:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And there may just be
a plot to kill them.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:84%
That is what the story of
"The Emissary" is all about.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.462 align:middle line:90%
You need to read it.

>>LISA: At the end of the
trailer you talk about

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
a nonprofit organization called
SaveEarth'sOceans.org, is that

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.914 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: That's right.

started this foundation?

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Yes.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:10%
I founded it together
with a woman named

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:10%
Nicky Kilmers-Barber
back in 2012,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:10%
and we-- It's tricky doing this.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:84%
It takes so much to get
a 501(c)(3) approval from

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:84%
the government, so we've been
just really launching it.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.567 align:middle line:84%
And we just did a
concert in London

00:12:17.567 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:90%
called Singing the Oceans Alive.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:10%
And the idea for
this concert was

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:10%
let's let the whales
and dolphins know

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.735 align:middle line:10%
that humans are tuned
into their music.

00:12:24.735 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
It was with the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It was my first ever production.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:10%
And it was fabulous.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:10%
So we want to raise
consciousness with the children

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:10%
and with people
as far as we can,

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:10%
as far and wide that
there's something important

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:10%
going on with the
music of the oceans.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you bring in the
sounds of the cetaceans?

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Exactly.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.877 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: So almost every piece
had the haunting refrain

00:12:48.877 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
of the whales and dolphins
accompanying the music.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:90%
It was extraordinary.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that sound.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it a cry to you,
or is it a language?

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
What do you hear
when you hear it?

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I think-- well,
I hear many things,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:84%
because I do also think that
the whales are calling out.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And there is suffering
there, even though we

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:07.782 align:middle line:84%
don't want to think
about the suffering,

00:13:07.782 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to think
about the sadness.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
We know these animals to
be higher consciousness,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.737 align:middle line:90%
breathtakingly joyous beings.

00:13:14.737 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But of course they are
hunted, they are suffering,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.382 align:middle line:84%
their calves are watching
the mothers being hoisted out

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:90%
of the water in hooks.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:90%
So there is that.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying my best to focus
on the light, and the music,

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and the significance of a whale
call-- the humpback whales,

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:84%
their calls can be up to
35, 40 minute refrains

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:90%
with no repetition.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's some serious
music going on here.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And they can broadcast
this, it's estimated,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:84%
somewhere between a half a
mile to a mile in distance.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.613 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And I'm very
excited about it.

00:13:51.613 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are
somehow relaying the music

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:84%
around the planet and
speaking to the oceans.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you've had the
experience to be in the ocean

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.332 align:middle line:84%
during the time when these
animals are communicating

00:14:05.332 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:90%
with each other, haven't you?

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.081 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Yeah.

00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, I go every summer.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:84%
I've started being out with the
whales and dolphins in boats

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:90%
for at least 10 years.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And in 2010 I went to the Azores
islands to swim in the wild

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:84%
with dolphins, because I
had been once in a tank

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and it ended up being a
healing for the dolphin.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to never swim
with dolphins in a tank again.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And I decided, well, I'm
going have to jump in,

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and if I'm going to
jump in, I'm going

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:84%
to jump into the
wild, wild ocean.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, tell
me about the--

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
we have a picture here
of you in the tank

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:90%
with this particular dolphin.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.235 align:middle line:10%
What are dolphins like when
they're in captivity like that?

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: Unfortunately,
of course,

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:10%
they're like circus
animals, because they

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:10%
are trained to respond to
the immediate gratification

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.939 align:middle line:10%
of the fish or the food.

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: The reward.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: And their job is to look
happy and jump through hoops

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:10%
and to entertain humans.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:10%
And I'm adamant that
we close these centers.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And so being in the tank with
dolphins, I don't like it.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that we
should be doing that.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:10%
But in the case that I was in
Cabo San Lucas, in this tank,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:10%
I was there because I
wanted to experience

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.910 align:middle line:10%
one dolphin, human
to dolphin contact.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
No dancing, no
hoops, no nothing.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So they allowed
me as a journalist

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to go in and be
with this dolphin.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And this particular dolphin
was very traumatized,

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because they said that they
had found him swimming alone.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
But I know that dolphins
don't swim alone.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So they probably ripped
him away from his pod.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was very nervous
and very unhappy.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:10%
And I've been a healer
for so many years

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:10%
that what was supposedly
going to be a swim turned out

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:10%
to me actually doing a
healing on this dolphin.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:84%
He swam into my arms,
because I told the trainer,

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:90%
stop with the fish.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
see him do tricks.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to see if there's any way
that we can touch each other.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:90%
And he swam out to me once.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:90%
She gave him the fish.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:10%
And then I said no more fish.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:10%
He swam around me again.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:10%
I put my arms out and I
said, can you feel me?

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.011 align:middle line:90%
And he swam right into my arms.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what
was the connection?

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.968 align:middle line:84%
What was the
communication that you

00:16:21.968 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:90%
received as a result of that?

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: Well, I-- as
an animal communicator,

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:10%
I just felt his pain and
his trauma and sadness.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:84%
It makes me cry, so-- I
didn't want to do that.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:37.089 align:middle line:84%
But he swam into my arms and I
just-- automatic healer mode.

00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there are
all these instructions.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Don't turn him in, don't
touch the dolphin here.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:10%
I just-- Pff.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.950 align:middle line:10%
And I went into healing, and
he fell asleep in my arms.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: It was so amazing.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Closed his eyes?

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.642 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Yeah, he did.

00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:50.141 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aww.

00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:54.645 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And this
communication was thank you.

00:16:54.645 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for caring.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It was very powerful for me,
and it set the stage for me.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.774 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have contact
with this dolphin anymore?

00:17:01.774 --> 00:17:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: I don't.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No?

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: I can't.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I just can't go anywhere
near a caged dolphin or whale

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
anymore, because as a
sensitive, I can hear a lot,

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want
to hear that pain.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:14.722 align:middle line:90%
So I'm--

00:17:14.722 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's gripping
just to hear.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.939 align:middle line:84%
I I'm tense, just-- I'll look at
that a completely different way

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:20.920 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look here
at you in the Azores Islands,

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:90%
In your natural habitat.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Take a look here
at Patricia Cori.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:43.655 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Hi, everyone.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.810 align:middle line:84%
We're here in the Azores,
which I have repeatedly

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:90%
referred to as Atlantis.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the only one,
because most of the locals

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
You see pizzerias, and
restaurants, even wine labels

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:90%
called Atlantis.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of an
unspoken truth here.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But it has always been
Atlantis for me from the moment

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I arrived, and I flew
over Pico Island.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And this mountaintop was
looming out of the cloud layer,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:84%
so that from the
airplane I could

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:84%
see this mountain--
the Pico Mountain--

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:90%
and then this fog beneath it.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And to be in an
airplane and see this,

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:84%
it was just such an
exciting moment for me,

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and I felt that I was home.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it's my mission
to bring as many people

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:middle line:84%
here as possible without letting
the secret out and destroying

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the intimacy of this
wonderful place, that here sit

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.165 align:middle line:84%
nine islands which
I truly believe

00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:84%
are remnants of the
continent of Atlantis--

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:84%
whether these are peaks
from the continent

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.070 align:middle line:84%
or whether these are somehow
islands that were part

00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
of the entire chain or the
entire continental structure.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:84%
To me and to people
that are with me now

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and others that I
have shared this with,

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:90%
there's simply no question.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Energetically there
is a return that you

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:90%
feel when you get here.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And whether you are a psychic,
or whether you're just

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
sensitive enough
to pay attention,

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
it is unquestionable
that you have come home.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a very exciting
place to be.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And at this time when the world
is so fraught with disaster,

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and catastrophe consciousness,
and fear, prophecy, doomsday,

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:84%
all of this, you cannot help
but wonder as you walk through

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
these gardens of Eden if
you-- in my case at least,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I just feel that I'm recording
into my soul the beauty of this

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
great planet, walking
through gardens of Eden,

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle line:84%
recording every leaf,
memorizing this beautiful world,

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:84%
so that wherever my
next destination is,

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I will have this incredible
gallery in my soul of all

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
the places of Earth
that most spoke to me.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:90%
And surely this is one.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But now is the time to take
yourselves to the beauty.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's get out of the focus of
all the disaster and trauma.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:90%
And sure, there's so much of it.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't for a moment
suggest that you

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
live in a la-la
land of resistance

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:84%
to anything that
causes any suffering

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
or concern, because as concerned
citizens of this planet I

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:84%
personally believe we
have a responsibility

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:46.070 align:middle line:84%
to look at both aspects in
the duality of our reality.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:84%
We need to be open
to explore all of it,

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to think about it, to
contribute to healing it.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But, that said, I'm
personally dedicated

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
in these years of my
life to taking myself

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to the sacred places
and recording them

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.622 align:middle line:90%
in this journal of my soul.

>>LISA: When you
went to the Azores

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Islands was that home for you?

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel at home there?

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:10%
Looks like you are.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: I had the most
amazing experience,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.990 align:middle line:10%
because I have an
affinity for Atlantis.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
flying to the Azores,

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
the mountain is called Pico
Mountain on Pico Island,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and this mountain was
looming through the clouds

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and I looked out the
window and went "Ah!"

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of strange to see
a mountain over the clouds.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I think you'll
see that in the clip-- I say,

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, this is Atlantis.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm home.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:10%
And that feels that way to me.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:10%
And the locals also
know that it's Atlantis.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:51.682 align:middle line:84%
So I was excited, because I
have this affinity for Atlantis.

00:21:51.682 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:84%

of the history of it

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.750 align:middle line:84%

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
of Cuba, everywhere-- in the
Mediterranean, et cetera.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Plato said that it was
a real civilization,

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.814 align:middle line:84%
and it was located right
outside the Pillars of Hercules,

00:22:15.814 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
which is the Straits
of Gibraltar,

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.512 align:middle line:84%
and that is Atlantis, and--
I'm sorry, that is the Azores--

00:22:20.512 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The Azores, OK.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: So that's an
interesting thing to note.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And then my
understanding of Atlantis

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is that it was not an island
as we are looking for,

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:84%
but rather an incredibly
large continent that

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
extended from as far north as
Greenland all the way south

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:43.565 align:middle line:84%
to the South American
continent, so that it had--

00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
like other countries,
it had freezing cold,

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:90%
it had blistering hot weather.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And it expanded in such
a way that of course this

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:84%
would explain the facility for
pyramids and other structures

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
to have appeared in
similar cultures,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.650 align:middle line:84%
because there was this big
continent in the middle where

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.387 align:middle line:90%
the Atlanteans brought it out.

00:23:04.387 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you
think that it's just

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
an extension of
the mountain range

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:13.249 align:middle line:84%
that either the water
rose or the island sank?

00:23:13.249 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: I do.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that first of all
the, Mid-Atlantic Ridge

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
is a mountain range
from Atlantis.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've been told, although I
don't know that-- personally--

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that there are points where
ships cannot cross the Atlantic

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:84%
because it is so shallow because
of this mountain range that

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:90%
they could be in danger.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's very interesting.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It may not have been a total
cataclysm as we understand it,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
but a rising of the
waters and the shifting

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:90%
of Earth's continents.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the people
on this island of Azores

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
believe that this was
the island-- or off

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:90%
of the coast of Atlantis?

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: They do.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there's this
subtle nuance of the Atlantis

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:57.200 align:middle line:90%
pizza parlor, Atlantis taxis.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's not that touristic.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.132 align:middle line:84%
It does enjoy an
ecotourism type of tourism,

00:24:03.132 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:84%
but it's not the
kind of place that

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.710 align:middle line:84%
would capitalize on that
just because it's cool.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about the locals?

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:90%
What do they say, the elders?

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.753 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: They know, They do know.

00:24:11.753 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of
the locals told me

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that these two islands--
Horta, where I have my home,

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and Pico-- are actually-- were
once above-- were connected,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:90%
land above water.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can see certain
structures there

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that you can intimate were
connected, land mass connected.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:10%
And also the very
exciting news is

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:10%
that last year a
fisherman was sailing off

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:10%
of San Miguel, which
is not that far away,

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:10%
and he saw a pyramid underwater.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And this pyramid supposedly
is perfectly aligned

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and may be bigger than
the Great Pyramid.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:84%
What about the cetaceans
in the area, the dolphins

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:90%
and the wildlife?

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Are they in any way
different than you notice

00:24:58.690 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:90%
around the world?

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.109 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: That's a
very good question.

00:25:01.109 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:10%
They are abundant.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Abundant.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.867 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: There are so many
common dolphins there.

00:25:04.867 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:10%
Do you know which ones they are?

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:06.815 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Mm-mm.

00:25:06.815 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: The common dolphins
are these gorgeous creatures.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:84%
They have beige and
golden yellow stripes,

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:90%
and wavy lines on their bodies.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can see thousands
of them in the water.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Thousands.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:84%
But it has a very rich
cetacean community there.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And as far as them being
different, they're just free.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They must feel safe,
if there is-- their numbers.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: They're free, the
water is still relatively pure,

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and they are abundant.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's take a
look here at Patricia

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.190 align:middle line:84%
on a boat playing with some
of these wonderful dolphins.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.356 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: We have spent
days on the water

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:52.110 align:middle line:84%
with every species imaginable,
from Risso's dolphins, who

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.970 align:middle line:90%
tend to be very shy.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
They stay far away
from the boat.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:90%
They don't interact.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.415 align:middle line:84%
These dolphins, right at
the end of the meditation

00:26:01.415 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and the invocation to
asking them to let us in,

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
they surrounded the
ship-- the boat.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:90%
They spun.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:90%
They swam on their backs.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They were totally
connected to us.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And we understand that
it's a little bit more

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:84%
than the natural
process for them.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.176 align:middle line:84%
We understand that they heard
the call and came to join us.

00:26:24.176 --> 00:26:26.168 align:middle line:90%
We were with blue whales.

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:90%
We saw two blue whales.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.450 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who understand
the cetacean community,

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.905 align:middle line:84%
you truly know how rare it is
to get up close to a blue--

00:26:35.905 --> 00:26:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to even sight
them-- but to get up

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:84%
so close that they're
next to the boat.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:90%
This also is a rare occurrence.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:84%
We have countless other tales
to tell, and some of my group

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.440 align:middle line:84%
here will share
their impressions,

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:84%
but one thing I
want to drive home

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.864 align:middle line:84%
is that it was our intention
as emissaries of the human race

00:26:58.864 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to open connection, open
contact at that very high level

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.252 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness where
the heart speaks.

00:27:06.252 --> 00:27:11.624 align:middle line:84%
And this we accomplished with
great dignity, great humility,

00:27:11.624 --> 00:27:14.566 align:middle line:90%
great respect, and celebration.

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:17.964 align:middle line:84%
So it has been a most
remarkable journey.

00:27:17.964 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:84%
There will be more, but it's
the best kept secret in town.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can see why you would
spend so much time up there.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Have you been in our Pacific
Ocean and off of the coast

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.480 align:middle line:90%
here in these Pacific waters?

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Is it same feeling?

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: Well, I've spent time in
Hawaii, which I know you love,

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and we have so many
dolphins and whales there,

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and I've been out in Vancouver.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, just
living in San Francisco,

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:84%
you've got plenty
of activity there.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But as far as it being
different, it's very different.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.680 align:middle line:84%
First of all the water
is more polluted--

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.472 align:middle line:84%
I hate to tell you this--
than it is off of the islands.

00:27:59.472 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say
that the Atlantic

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Ocean is less polluted.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.584 align:middle line:84%
But in that place, the water's
really pretty clear still.

00:28:05.584 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Population
isn't as dense,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:90%
of course, where you were.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.356 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Exactly.

00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:11.375 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the islands have
very low population density,

00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:12.680 align:middle line:90%
so that helps.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But I have based "The
Emissary" off of Vancouver.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's a ocean liner--
I'm sorry-- an oil research

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.270 align:middle line:84%
vessel that is looking
for oil out there.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And as you know there,
unfortunately they've

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
opened up the Pacific
now for oil exploration.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, I didn't-- more
than it's been explored?

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Well, yeah.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:90%
More than it's been explored.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What type of
damage does an oil tanker

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.970 align:middle line:90%
like that cause to the ocean?

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: For starters,
they're using sonar,

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:10%
and sonar is blowing the
brains out of cetaceans.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the something
that I am dedicated--

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.139 align:middle line:84%
I'm dedicating my
life to turning off

00:28:54.139 --> 00:28:55.930 align:middle line:84%
the sonar on the planet,
and "The Emissary"

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:84%
is also dedicated to
educating people about that.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So the ocean research
vessels, even fishing vessels,

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and of course the Navy,
are ripping the ocean apart

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:90%
with these excruciating sounds.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding
dolphins and whales

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.330 align:middle line:84%
with their brains
blown out, because they

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:90%
have very large aural cavities.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the pressure of
sound can be very painful

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and deafen them
or just literally

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:90%
blow their brains apart.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.697 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:29:24.697 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: This is happening.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:84%

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
they must destroy the entire

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.660 align:middle line:90%
that they're drilling.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Yeah.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I forgot to mention
that, didn't I?

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.630 align:middle line:84%
The drilling-- first
of all, the noise.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
The noise is very,
very important.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But of course, as in the
Gulf did this ever end?

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:84%
We're told that
it was an accident

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and they were
plugging it up, but we

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:84%
know that all these years of
dredging, dredging, dredging,

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
this oil is just seeping
out of the ocean floor.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:59.690 align:middle line:90%
It's very serious.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, talking
about seeping out,

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.860 align:middle line:90%
we've got Fukushima.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
serious ongoing issue

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:90%
that has no end in sight.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:10%
What is it that you
know about this?

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: I don't understand
why the human race is

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:10%
sitting back and doing-- really
not talking about Fukushima

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.040 align:middle line:10%
because it's too scary.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that at
the time that this occurred,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to know where were
the nuclear physicists, where

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:84%
were the nuclear
engineers, why wasn't there

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:84%
a global presence of all
of our top scientists

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.170 align:middle line:90%
to do something about this?

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:10%
Instead, Tepco had carte
blanche to fix the problem.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:10%
And some of the ideas
they had were sawdusting.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Sawdusting nuclear fission.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the latest
genius idea is

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.714 align:middle line:84%
to build an ice wall
to somehow stop it

00:30:50.714 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%
from seeping into the earth.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile tons of
nuclear material

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.070 align:middle line:84%
are pumped into the water
every day, our oceans,

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:90%
and now into the Earth's crust.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.514 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every single day.

00:31:00.514 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that there has been
a band of scientists that

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:84%
have been attempting
to collaborate on this,

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.380 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
actually allowed in?

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.110 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: Well, I don't know
that they've been collaborating

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:10%
as much as we need them, at the
level of the United Nations.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.170 align:middle line:84%
We need absolute
global intervention.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:90%
This is a global problem.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And this has not occurred.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So now Tepco asks for
our help and we give it,

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:84%
but there are these fine gray
lines that are not defined.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And if ever there was
need for the United--

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:84%
the world to come together,
it's now, about this.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.192 align:middle line:84%
Now, your question about
how this affects the oceans.

00:31:39.192 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:10%
You know, you need to be very
concerned here in California,

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:10%
because we know this mass is
moving into the West Coast,

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:10%
and we see some very
devastating signs.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The mass of
the nuclear waste?

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: This-- let's
say plume, they

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.980 align:middle line:84%
call it-- of nuclear
cloud, if you will.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.312 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it visible?

00:31:58.312 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Oh, yeah.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.220 align:middle line:90%
It's trackable.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there's some
pretty devastating things going

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:90%
on on the West Coast.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Readings, Half Moon Bay--
I don't know about here

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.840 align:middle line:84%
in Southern California,
but it's happening,

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and we are seeing some very
frightening things occurring.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:90%
More dead whales and dolphins.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The starfish are
turning to mush.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.980 align:middle line:84%
The sardine population
has disappeared.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And the seals are
turning up dead

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:90%
with sores on their bodies.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.390 align:middle line:84%
We need to do something
about Fukushima,

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and we need to do it globally,
and with great haste.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And now from a, let's say a
higher consciousness level,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
Mother Earth knows

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
how to cope with
destruction and with--

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Disaster--

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: --disaster.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to think that
the Sun and the Earth--

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:84%
celestial conscious
bodies-- are going

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to be able to somehow put this
into some sort of framework

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.540 align:middle line:90%
where it's manageable.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: You know, it's
beyond our understanding.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But we know there's-- the
Sun is such a powerful,

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:05.870 align:middle line:90%
powerful being.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the strange
goings on on the Sun

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:84%
now may have something
to do with being

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:19.180 align:middle line:84%
able to liberate the planet
from this horrible disaster

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.560 align:middle line:90%
that we-- I don't know.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an esoteric
question, actually.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
there may be some sort

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.780 align:middle line:84%
of celestial
management energy that

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.935 align:middle line:84%
can help us clear this
out, because otherwise I

00:33:31.935 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:84%
don't know what's
going to happen here.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
that the Sun could

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:84%
take care of the vapors
if they were to escape?

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how could that--
what could possibly happen?

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: Well, when we consider
the Sun and its-- the energies

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.590 align:middle line:84%
that are wrapping around
the planet all the time

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetosphere,
things that

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:84%
are a little bit beyond,
I'm sure, my understanding,

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
unreasonable to think that

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:84%
in that dynamic energy exchange
between the Sun and the Earth,

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:84%
there may be a way that
the Sun is actually

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:84%
able to absorb out some
of this nuclear fission.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm hoping.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you seen any
evidence of these plumes?

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen what
they look like?

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
Are they-- you obviously
have seen the fallout of it.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:84%
But do you know where
they're located?

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.300 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: Nuclear fission and
nuclear waste are so insipid.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You can't really
visibly see them.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But we do have charts
now where we're

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:35.500 align:middle line:84%
seeing heat sensitive images
of where this plume is moving.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.929 align:middle line:84%
And it's right over
Hawaii, and it's supposedly

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:84%
going to be over California
within a month or two.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what
happens to the fish,

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:84%
if we were to eat the
fish from these regions--

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.809 align:middle line:90%
which I wouldn't, I mean--

00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: That's a good question.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.683 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
question, and that

00:34:52.683 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:84%
is just because
it's over the water

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and there's nuclear fission
going into the water,

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.690 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that it's
not also in the air.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's shortsighted
for the human race

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%
to think that, oh well, maybe
it'll be somehow just confined

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to the Pacific Ocean-- which in
itself is so horrifying that I

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:17.110 align:middle line:84%
can't even think
about it-- but we

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.740 align:middle line:84%
do see these graphs
with this huge red plume

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.460 align:middle line:84%
as far as heat sensitive
graphing moving dangerously

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:90%
present now to California.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if-- I mean,
what would that make people

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.560 align:middle line:84%
want to move towards
the Atlantic to source

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:90%
all of their fish?

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would of course
create an imbalance in that.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.547 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I think it's
time to stop eating fish.

00:35:41.547 --> 00:35:42.880 align:middle line:90%
That is going to get a reaction.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.754 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was where
I was going with this.

00:35:44.754 --> 00:35:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I am personally a
vegetarian for 28 years.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think for a
number of reasons,

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:84%
first of all-- between
the mercury poisoning,

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and the Fukushima,
and all the toxicity--

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and we know how toxic
our oceans are--

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.360 align:middle line:84%
human waste-- I don't
need to go there.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time
to stop eating fish.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And also because the
fish need to eat fish,

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.670 align:middle line:84%
the bigger fish need to
eat fish, the sea mammals.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:10%
We need to stop destroying
that food chain.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:19.080 align:middle line:10%
And so I think that it's time to
be consciously aware that when

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:23.980 align:middle line:10%
you're sitting down to a
bowl of clams or whatever,

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:10%
you are ingesting a
lot of this toxicity

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.830 align:middle line:10%
and it's a choice that we need
to be more conscious about.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:32.115 align:middle line:90%
Add the Fukushima problem too.

00:36:32.115 --> 00:36:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
definitely-- I mean,

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:84%
absolutely something
to consider.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:84%
In the fact that the fish are
eating the other toxic fish,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.640 align:middle line:84%
this is causing-- must
be causing devastation

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.184 align:middle line:90%
within the entire food chain.

00:36:46.184 --> 00:36:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Exactly.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And they are also
eating plastic,

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.677 align:middle line:84%
which is another subject we
need to address, and that is--

00:36:50.677 --> 00:36:51.926 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's talk about that.

00:36:51.926 --> 00:36:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: --there are
now five islands

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.911 align:middle line:90%

00:36:54.911 --> 00:36:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain islands.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: OK.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Where the currents sort of
come into a sort of a-- they're

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.410 align:middle line:84%
actually called gyros--
the plastic waste

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:84%
in the oceans, which is breaking
down into little pieces,

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.970 align:middle line:84%
coagulates and forms density
and becomes eventually

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:15.990 align:middle line:90%
like an island.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Very, very dense.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And then this gooey, horrible--
beneath these islands

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:26.160 align:middle line:84%
is a sort of plasma of
decomposing plastic.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So the birds are eating
the plastic, the gulls.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.760 align:middle line:84%
The fish are eating this
gooey horrible stuff.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.587 align:middle line:90%
They're finding fish--

00:37:34.587 --> 00:37:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With it in
their stomach, yes.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: --with plastic
in their stomachs.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.671 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, we're eating it.

00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: This is why I
formed Save Earth's Oceans,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.910 align:middle line:84%
to try to do my best,
in my small way,

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:90%
to help awaken people to that.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:90%
We need to stop using plastic.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.920 align:middle line:90%
We are the plastic generation.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.817 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And there's so
much that we need to do.

00:37:57.817 --> 00:37:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Explain,
though, because these

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.310 align:middle line:84%
are devastating and potentially
completely destructive

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.000 align:middle line:84%
concepts that we're talking
about with the nuclear waste

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and with the
plastics in the ocean

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.760 align:middle line:84%
and where we're going with
this, within our lifetime,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:90%
is complete devastation.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.320 align:middle line:90%
What could your organization do?

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.520 align:middle line:84%
What could one organization
do to help this?

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: What can one person do?

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Look at Captain Paul Watson.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:84%
This man is out there
risking his life every day

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.120 align:middle line:84%
on the ocean, and he
is integral in stopping

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese from
killing whales.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:90%
So what can we do?

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.880 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I believe
in the win-win scenario.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going with
the devastation

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.514 align:middle line:84%
of the world, final
Armageddon belief system.

00:38:43.514 --> 00:38:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.344 align:middle line:84%
Was Paul Watson the one
that strapped himself

00:38:46.344 --> 00:38:47.915 align:middle line:90%
on the front of the boat?

00:38:47.915 --> 00:38:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Did he?

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.352 align:middle line:90%
Was he one of the ones?

00:38:51.352 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the members of
Greenpeace did that.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.435 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: Greenpeace
did that, too.

00:38:54.435 --> 00:38:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Watson was one of
the founders of Greenpeace,

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and then he broke
away, and-- I think

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.214 align:middle line:84%
they weren't radical
enough for him.

00:39:01.214 --> 00:39:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Exactly,
because he was radical.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Yeah, he is.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And he does some radical things.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:10%
But he has been very integral--
that's not the right word--

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.554 align:middle line:10%
very decisive in being part of
the ending that we just were

00:39:13.554 --> 00:39:14.970 align:middle line:10%
able to rejoice
about a month ago,

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:10%
when the high court of
the United Nations said

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.210 align:middle line:10%
the Japanese can no longer
go out with their research

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:10%
vessels--

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Whaling.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And they will
find another way,

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:27.650 align:middle line:84%
because the mandate
was very specific.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:30.220 align:middle line:84%
They can't use
the research veil.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.827 align:middle line:90%
And Paul will be out there--

00:39:31.827 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Again.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.076 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: --again.

00:39:33.076 --> 00:39:34.820 align:middle line:90%
And so what can one person do?

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:90%
What can an organization do?

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:38.860 align:middle line:90%
We can move mountains.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.970 align:middle line:10%
And if we remember that
we're eight billion people

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:10%
on this planet and we
can open consciousness

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.490 align:middle line:10%
to the responsibility for
being guardians of this planet,

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.010 align:middle line:10%
we will heal this planet.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you
feel that you have

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:57.280 align:middle line:84%
this passion and this mission
because you've been here before

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.050 align:middle line:90%
in another life?

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: Thank you
for that question.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I was there
when Atlantis went down.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.632 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very
similar paradigm.

00:40:06.632 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the
feeling that you feel?

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.256 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: The feeling is
we are on the precipice

00:40:10.256 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:84%
of total destruction or
total salvation-- or not even

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:90%
salvation-- total rebirth.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this
can go either way,

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and that this time,
we will not go down.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems to me that
the human race only really gets

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:84%
moving when we're
up against the wall.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:36.530 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, in those
moments of total disaster,

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.660 align:middle line:84%
that's when our humanity
really comes shining through.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you were on
Atlantis, and if it did sink,

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.170 align:middle line:84%
what do you feel you
could have done about it?

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.970 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.214 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Huh.

00:40:52.214 --> 00:40:53.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if I have
an answer for that.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Esoteric question, but
I know you'll go there with me.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Because just as if-- I see that
this, what you're doing now,

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:09.100 align:middle line:84%
is your chance to
do that over again.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I think that there
was an abuse of technology

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.580 align:middle line:84%
on Atlantis, and it
was crystal technology.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know the myths about
crystal pyramids and whatever.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.517 align:middle line:84%
And I really do remember a
lot of this lifetime there.

00:41:22.517 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what way?

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: I have visions.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:28.720 align:middle line:84%
I have dreams all the
time of crystal pyramids.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And one specific
thing that I remember

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.290 align:middle line:84%
is putting my hand on the
wall of a pyramid, a crystal

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:37.220 align:middle line:84%
pyramid, and being able
to walk right through it.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: So we are at that
point again with technology.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:90%
We're doing teleportation.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.340 align:middle line:84%
We're not being told
everything they're doing.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But if we are at this point
where we're now being told that

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.310 align:middle line:84%
they've been able to
move a quantum of light

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:56.540 align:middle line:84%
by teleportation, then we can
be comfortable to know that

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.040 align:middle line:90%
they're--

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.331 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a lot greater--

00:41:58.331 --> 00:42:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: --already moving
maybe even cities.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:01.706 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: More
advanced technologies

00:42:01.706 --> 00:42:03.205 align:middle line:90%
are definitely out there, yes.

00:42:03.205 --> 00:42:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And so I think that
this abuse of that power

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.480 align:middle line:90%
is happening again.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And that the people were asleep.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to wake them
up as best as I know how.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's
take a look here

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.630 align:middle line:84%
at a video clip of Patricia
talking about Atlantis.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I do have an
extraordinary recall

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.400 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, vivid recall
of more than one lifetime.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So being here is as much about
being with the cetaceans, being

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:35.620 align:middle line:84%
out on the ocean-- which
I adore-- as it is tuning

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:84%
into the vibration of this
earth, this place in the middle

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.770 align:middle line:84%
of nowhere, in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean,

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:47.170 align:middle line:84%
where I am so sure--
such conviction

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:50.510 align:middle line:84%
that I have walked
many other lifetimes.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And that this is
something I share

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.120 align:middle line:84%
with people that
are with me now.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.764 align:middle line:90%
It is so powerful.

00:42:57.764 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You can-- for people who
don't believe in past lives

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.950 align:middle line:84%
or reincarnation, it's easy
to dismiss as a fantasy.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:84%
But for those of us who do,
when you return to a place

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.590 align:middle line:84%
you've been before,
there is a knowing that

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:22.532 align:middle line:84%
is so deep, so profound,
that it defies description.

00:43:22.532 --> 00:43:24.516 align:middle line:90%
And it's very personal.

00:43:24.516 --> 00:43:27.492 align:middle line:84%
You will never convince
another person of it.

00:43:27.492 --> 00:43:31.444 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
yours to hold sacred.

00:43:31.444 --> 00:43:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm asked,
what is this like for you,

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:84%
aside from the joy of
being a person who's

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.340 align:middle line:84%
able to guide other
people to the experience,

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:48.708 align:middle line:84%
for me it is adding
another little piece

00:43:48.708 --> 00:43:53.812 align:middle line:84%
of the puzzle of cellular
memory of the soul's journey,

00:43:53.812 --> 00:43:56.720 align:middle line:84%
putting another little
piece in that jigsaw

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.470 align:middle line:84%
as it begins to take form
and all these little pieces

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:08.330 align:middle line:84%
begin to create the image, the
tapestry, of where you've been,

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:11.780 align:middle line:84%
what you've come to do,
and where you're headed.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Those that
are familiar and feel

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that resonance that you
have with Atlantis probably

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.672 align:middle line:84%
appreciate watching that,
because it resonates in a way

00:44:22.672 --> 00:44:24.310 align:middle line:90%
that you can't explain.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:25.235 align:middle line:90%
It's a vibration.

00:44:25.235 --> 00:44:25.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.185 align:middle line:90%
It's an essence, right?

00:44:27.185 --> 00:44:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Indeed.

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the thing is
that all through humanity we're

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.830 align:middle line:90%
searching for Atlantis.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It had to have been such an
important part of our planet,

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.820 align:middle line:84%
because there isn't
a civilization that

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.070 align:middle line:84%
wasn't searching for
Atlantis, from the Greeks

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.320 align:middle line:90%
to the Egyptians.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And still today, perhaps
even more than before,

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.980 align:middle line:90%
we search Atlantis.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.617 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're
putting it back together.

00:44:50.617 --> 00:44:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's apropos that
we're speaking about it,

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.120 align:middle line:84%
because what we're
going through right now

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:00.190 align:middle line:84%
is mimicking the story in a very
odd way with the devastation

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:01.740 align:middle line:90%
that we're facing.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But the book is a
little bit about this.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.429 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of bringing this
about in a novel form, right?

00:45:07.429 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Yeah.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, the story
of "The Emissary"

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:14.540 align:middle line:10%
proposes that we
are at a precipice,

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.610 align:middle line:10%
and the whales and
dolphins are trying

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:21.780 align:middle line:10%
to communicate to humankind
that if we don't take action--

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.140 align:middle line:10%
and it has to do with
the music of the oceans--

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.770 align:middle line:10%
there will be a great calamity
and the planet will come down.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But what's the action?

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: Well, I don't want to
give away the book completely,

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:84%
but one of the
urgent things, again,

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.770 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about earlier
is stopping the sonar,

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.030 align:middle line:84%
stopping the machinery
and the technology that

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:45.430 align:middle line:84%
is blasting this planet with
extremely low frequency waves,

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.890 align:middle line:84%
laser waves, and all
of this high tech

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:51.060 align:middle line:84%
weaponry that we don't
actually know about,

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.880 align:middle line:84%
but which is
devastating the ecology.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, if
someone like Paul Watson

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.950 align:middle line:84%
could do what he did and
make such a huge difference

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and start an organization
like a Greenpeace,

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.660 align:middle line:84%
there are two million
environmental organizations

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.640 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Two million.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So that means that there is a
cry for people to want to help,

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:middle line:84%
to want to do something but
it's-- they're all individual

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:18.900 align:middle line:90%
organizations.

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Exactly.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're not
the same organization.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:22.056 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Exactly.

00:46:22.056 --> 00:46:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, many
times these organizations

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.560 align:middle line:90%
have their own agenda.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.060 align:middle line:84%
They're-- we're looking for
sponsors and for support.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So they're-- we're not sharing
as much as we need to be,

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:37.600 align:middle line:84%
because in order to effect
change we need to unite forces,

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.070 align:middle line:90%
and you're spot on about that.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:39.736 align:middle line:90%
And I'm hoping--

00:46:39.736 --> 00:46:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Imagine if all of
those millions of organizations

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:47.010 align:middle line:84%
got together in one place,
that would move some mountains.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I was recently in
the WhaleFest in Brighton

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:51.650 align:middle line:84%
in England, and it was
very exciting to see

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:54.310 align:middle line:84%
all of these
organizations united,

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and 15,000 people--
many children-- coming

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.500 align:middle line:90%
to learn more.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.702 align:middle line:90%
So we're getting there.

00:46:59.702 --> 00:47:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me
about the children.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.930 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned
educating children.

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: You know, I think I can
wrap this into a small story,

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and that is at the concert,
a little boy came up to me

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and he was with
his mom, and he had

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:84%
a little-- I had
donation envelopes--

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and he handed me this envelope,
and he said, "I'm sorry.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not very much
for the dolphins,

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.350 align:middle line:90%
but will you give it to them?"

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aww.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And I said,
"It's so much."

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.944 align:middle line:84%
"And when I get bigger I'm
going to help them more."

00:47:30.944 --> 00:47:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And I opened up this little
envelope, and there was,

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I think, $0.20 in it.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is the hope
of the world, right here.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And if one child can be
touched by an event like that,

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.780 align:middle line:84%
or a campaign, or
whatever, that person

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.540 align:middle line:84%
could possibly go on to
effect enormous change.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.969 align:middle line:84%
So the children are the
guardians of the future.

00:47:50.969 --> 00:47:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: They are the vision.

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.305 align:middle line:84%

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:59.441 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: So they need

00:47:59.441 --> 00:48:04.200 align:middle line:84%
now and grow with it and know
that probably one of the most

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.610 align:middle line:84%
important things
of their lives will

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.602 align:middle line:84%
be to heal the ecological

00:48:09.602 --> 00:48:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is going to

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:16.500 align:middle line:84%
You take people on journeys
to areas, the Azores Islands

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.370 align:middle line:90%
specifically.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.800 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when you
take them on the journeys,

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.019 align:middle line:90%
and who do you bring?

00:48:21.019 --> 00:48:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I have a
wonderful following,

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.580 align:middle line:84%
which I'm really
pleased to announce.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's over many, many
years and many books later.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:31.629 align:middle line:84%
So I take trips
to Egypt, and I'm

00:48:31.629 --> 00:48:33.420 align:middle line:84%
talking about opening
the gates and getting

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.110 align:middle line:90%
into the other dimensions.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I do trips to Egypt
where I get people

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.590 align:middle line:84%
into the temples in the
middle of the night.

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're there alone
with the energies there,

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite a
remarkable experience.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:47.170 align:middle line:90%

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.930 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.221 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was one of the
most extraordinary stories?

00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: I think the--
with a group or by myself?

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: By yourself.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: By myself.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I decided that I wanted to
get into a temple alone.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.730 align:middle line:90%
It's called Abydos temple.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And the village people are
scared to death of this temple

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:11.760 align:middle line:84%
because at night
they hear ghosts.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.175 align:middle line:84%
They hear so much
activity inside there

00:49:14.175 --> 00:49:15.310 align:middle line:90%
that they're terrified.

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're also
Muslims so that is not

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:84%
appropriate for their religion
and their belief systems.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So I know a lot of people
there, and I said, OK, I

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.140 align:middle line:84%
want to be locked inside
the temple at night.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:30.240 align:middle line:90%
And my contact there said, why?

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.272 align:middle line:90%
What will happen to you?

00:49:31.272 --> 00:49:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, trust me.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm very comfortable
with spirits,

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:84%
because I walk
between the worlds.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But I do not want to be
locked in with any Egyptians,

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the
middle of the night.

00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:44.100 align:middle line:90%
But ghosts are just fine.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:44.887 align:middle line:90%
So we could--

00:49:44.887 --> 00:49:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Nothing
against the Egyptians.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:47.114 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:49:47.114 --> 00:49:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Exactly.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.155 align:middle line:84%
No it's just like
I wouldn't want

00:49:49.155 --> 00:49:53.390 align:middle line:84%
to be locked in a dark place
with people that I don't know.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So I went into this
temple within the temple,

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.860 align:middle line:90%
which is called the Isis chapel.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And we pretended that I was a
tourist, which is ridiculous,

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.090 align:middle line:84%
because I go there often
and they all know me.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I kind of stand out
at six foot tall.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.470 align:middle line:90%
But I got locked in.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what, when
I heard that click, click--

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:19.240 align:middle line:84%
five clicks of the

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.640 align:middle line:90%
In the dark.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:28.950 align:middle line:84%
In this ancient Egyptian,
8,000 year old temple.

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:30.272 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, the history.

00:50:30.272 --> 00:50:31.480 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.050 align:middle line:10%
>>CORI: And I had,
suddenly, a vision

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:40.310 align:middle line:10%
of priests, Egyptian priests
with the traditional garb,

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:42.640 align:middle line:10%
a little braid coming
out of their bald heads.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And they were walking toward me.

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize I was
in such an altered state,

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and I tried to move,
because I thought-- oh,

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:54.464 align:middle line:84%
and the one in front had
a basket with an offering.

00:50:54.464 --> 00:50:56.380 align:middle line:84%
So he was coming toward
me with this offering,

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that he
was bringing an offering

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.719 align:middle line:90%
to this chapel, Isis chapel.

00:51:02.719 --> 00:51:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get out of
the way and I couldn't move.

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I kept trying to move,
and I was absolutely

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.440 align:middle line:90%
unable to move my physical body.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And then from behind
them came a high priest.

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And he walked up to me, and
he started to-- at one point,

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.460 align:middle line:84%
he was giving me some
sort of a download.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this
was probably one

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:23.230 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful
experiences of my life.

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And right in the middle
of this lasers of golden light,

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:32.872 align:middle line:84%
I hear this voice,
"Madam!" "Madam!"

00:51:32.872 --> 00:51:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the
Egyptians that was outside.

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:39.910 align:middle line:84%
They were all part of this
plot, because this was illegal.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So they had all been
taken care of, let's say.

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And apparently someone
had gone to the police

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and told them that there
was somebody in the temple.

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:48.450 align:middle line:90%
So they had to get me out.

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:51.620 align:middle line:84%
But because they were all
terrified of this ghost thing,

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.214 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't come in.

00:51:53.214 --> 00:51:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm sitting there getting
this incredible download--

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my god.

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.834 align:middle line:84%

>>CORI: It broke me.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It broke the trance.

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did your life change
in any way after that?

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:06.999 align:middle line:84%
Did you think it

00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Yeah.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.914 align:middle line:10%
I thought that
actually, it might

00:52:08.914 --> 00:52:11.250 align:middle line:10%
have been when I was going
to leave this planet.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: I did, because
it was so incredible.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And another fascinating
part of this story

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:20.970 align:middle line:84%
is that my friend in Egypt,
when I told him what I'd seen,

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:22.010 align:middle line:90%
he turned white.

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this
is unbelievable,

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:25.750 align:middle line:90%
because there's a man.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.810 align:middle line:84%
His house is backed
up to the temple.

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:29.744 align:middle line:84%
And there's been
some waste going

00:52:29.744 --> 00:52:30.910 align:middle line:90%
into the wall of the temple.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And he always talks
about the-- he

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.510 align:middle line:84%
moved, because these
priests and the high priest

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:39.610 align:middle line:84%
were scaring him
and threatening him.

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So it was an
interesting validation--

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.419 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That, oh, the
stories, yes, coinciding.

00:52:43.419 --> 00:52:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: --the exact same.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
with the group?

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.835 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything
that the group

00:52:46.835 --> 00:52:48.600 align:middle line:84%
had experienced
when they went in?

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:50.438 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: Well, I take
them into the-- just

00:52:50.438 --> 00:52:53.710 align:middle line:84%
imagine the typical trip,
and then coming with me

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and the Karnak
temple in Luxor has

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.385 align:middle line:90%
200,000 to 500,000 people a day.

00:53:00.385 --> 00:53:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So you're standing
in this temple

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.843 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the day,
and it's sweltering hot,

00:53:03.843 --> 00:53:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the little
guys with the flag,

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and people saying, honey,
move over next to the statue,

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.600 align:middle line:90%
I want to take a picture.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not conducive to
having any kind of deep--

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Spiritual experience.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: But when
I take people, I

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.900 align:middle line:84%
open these places in the middle
of the night-- it costs me

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.050 align:middle line:90%
a lot of money to do that.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.622 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: And we're the only ones.

00:53:23.622 --> 00:53:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And when we walk in
I say, just remember,

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:27.260 align:middle line:90%
you've done this before.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's approach
this not as tourists,

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.700 align:middle line:84%
but as spiritual warriors,
spiritual seekers.

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Adventurers.

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: And when those
gates open and it's only us,

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:38.696 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine, 4:00 in
the morning with the stars

00:53:38.696 --> 00:53:39.320 align:middle line:90%
and the whole--

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And
obviously, the people

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that are attracted to
these types of journeys

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.130 align:middle line:84%
have been there before
and have that experience,

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:48.775 align:middle line:84%
or that knowledge or knowing
that they in some way

00:53:48.775 --> 00:53:50.650 align:middle line:84%
are called to go all
the way across the world

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:51.941 align:middle line:90%
from where they're coming from.

00:53:51.941 --> 00:53:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CORI: Exactly.

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:54.490 align:middle line:84%
But what's so great
about that is often

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:58.110 align:middle line:84%
they say, oh, Patricia,
another midnight wake up call?

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I say, hey, there's
two ways you can do this.

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:04.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're a spiritual
seeker, you've got to work.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:09.020 align:middle line:84%
You've got to-- seeking
means going through whatever

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.250 align:middle line:90%
it takes to get the experience.

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean having
your breakfast at 8 o'clock

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and getting on a tour
bus and getting there

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:20.510 align:middle line:84%
with 800 million other people,
but rather to be the privileged

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that are there like
the priesthood,

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:25.740 align:middle line:84%
walking in with the
dignity of that.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.865 align:middle line:90%

I have to say that
often people will

00:54:38.055 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:10%
put on social media,
my life I define

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:44.700 align:middle line:10%
as pre Egypt with
Patricia Cori, and after,

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.990 align:middle line:10%

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CORI: Yes, because
we swim with dolphins.

It's not just, oh
look at the dolphins.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.250 align:middle line:90%
We have to ask permission.

Let's ask them if we are
allowed into their pod.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.560 align:middle line:84%

amazing experiences,

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:15.002 align:middle line:84%

They are very shy.

They're not like humpbacks,

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:29.336 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you really teach--
it's the communication,

it's the receiving that
