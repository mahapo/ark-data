00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:17.761 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that there's
a new science emerging that

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:10%
is changing the
traditional understanding

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:10%
of health and healing.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.420 align:middle line:10%
There's research currently being
done focusing on experiments,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:10%
which are quantifying
the effects

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:10%
of energy using light frequency
coming from human beings.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:10%
Joining me today
to help us explore

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:10%
the power of
reconnective healing

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:10%
is internationally
recognized healer Eric Pearl.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Not only has Eric spoken
by invitation at the United

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Nations, presented to a full
house at Madison Square Garden,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
he experienced an overnight
shift in his healing abilities

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
that science calls
reconnective healing

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and he's here to
share it with us.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for joining
me today, Eric.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit about
what reconnective healing is.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:10%
Reconnective healing is a way
of accessing a level of healing

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:10%
that allows us to reconnect
with our original fullness,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:10%
the essence of who and
what we are so we no

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:10%
longer have to learn
techniques or approaches of how

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:10%
to do healing.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:10%
Instead we actually
become the healing

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:10%
and therefore inspire
the healing with others.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of-- an analogy
you could use would be is,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
if you take a lit
candle to light

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
another candle to
light another candle,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
the flame doesn't
do a technique.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:90%
The flame doesn't follow steps.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.340 align:middle line:84%
The flame doesn't cower in
fear and protect itself.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't get weaker.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:84%
If anything, it glows more
brightly and by doing so it's

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
steps into its own fullness,
its essence, its beauty,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
its perfection who and what it
is and by being in that space,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.725 align:middle line:84%
it inspires the next
candle to ignite

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:90%
and the next and the next.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.370 align:middle line:84%
This allows us to stop
doing the techniques

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and trying to do the
healings, but to instead,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:84%
become the healing
and therefore inspire

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:84%
the healings within everyone
with whom we interact.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So reconnective healing isn't
something that's outside of us

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
or something that
comes from the divine.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's all
around us all the time?

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:90%
It's inside of us.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It does come from the divine,
call it God, call it love,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
call it the intelligence
of the universe.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Pick whatever word you want.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It is us accessing
more fully that field,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that field that, well, I like
to call the field that refused

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
to die because it used to
be called the etheric field

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and in the late
1800s or so, science

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
was very horrified with
who they referred to

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
as otherwise seemingly
intelligent adults

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:90%
believing in invisible fields.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So science did what
science does best

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
is that it organized itself and
went and disproved the field.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for
science, the field

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
didn't realize it
had been disproven,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:84%
so in the early
1920s, it came back.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Science reorganized,
disproved it a second time.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The field came back
even more clearly

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and strongly, so strongly that
science today now uses it.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So to save face, they've changed
the name from the etheric field

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
to zero point field,
but everyone just calls

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
it the field and they wink.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:90%
The field.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:90%
So what does it do?

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Does it help heal pain?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Is it emotional
pain, physical pain?

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Reconnective healing?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
It helps allow us to
return to state a balance

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and when we return to
this state of balance,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
the imbalances simply
vibrate out of the picture.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Does it take you back to
your original blueprint?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what exactly
does that look like?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to return to our
natural vibration of light.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Energy healing helped.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:10%
Energy healing techniques
helped because they infused us

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:10%
with more energy,
but energy is only

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:10%
part of the healing spectrum.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:10%
The healing spectrum is
energy, light, and information

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.110 align:middle line:10%
and today we're accessing
levels of light and information

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:10%
that have not been seen
here on the planet before.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And light plays a very
fascinating role in healing.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know today
from the work of Dr. Fritz Popp

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
in Germany and others
that each of our cells

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
emits a specific level of DNA.
I'm sorry.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
The DNA in each
of our cells emits

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:90%
a specific level of light.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Light.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
As our health is diminishing,
that light is dimming.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
As our health is coming back up,
that light is coming back up.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting about
the role of light in the healing

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
spectrum of energy,
light, and information

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:90%
is that it serves as a reminder.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:84%
As we interact,
for instance, as I

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:84%
let you feel this in
our last interview,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
part of what you were
feeling was the light

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and it was serving
as a reminder to you

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:90%
of your natural light vibration.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
about that requires that we

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
understand it's a
complicated-sounding word,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
which isn't really
complicated at all.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:90%
The word is entropy.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Entropy is the basic
tendency for things to age,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
for things to break
down, for things

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:90%
to degenerate or fall apart.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Mechanical equipment
falls apart,

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:90%
wears down after a while.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.805 align:middle line:90%
This wooden table will become--

00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:90%
It ages.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
 --splinters, will
become eventually dust.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Speed freaks get older looking
faster from all the speed.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Speed is what increases entropy.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.600 align:middle line:84%
The more the speed, the more
the degeneration, the more the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.650 align:middle line:90%
aging, the more the entropy.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:90%
The faster the breakdown.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
However, what Dr. William
Tiller, professor emeritus

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of Stanford University
has discovered

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things he's
very famous for besides having

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
authored about a dozen books
and around 350 scientifically

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:84%
published peer-reviewed
papers, is he's

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
known for something that,
again, sounds complicated.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Tiller-Einstein
Model of Negative Entropy.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:90%
That sounds complicated.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Tiller means Dr. William Tiller,
Einstein means Albert Einstein,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:84%
model means, well,
hey, it's a model,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and negative entropy means
the opposite of entropy.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So the Tiller-Einstein
Model of Negative Entropy

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
is known to have
discovered that once we

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:84%
reach the speed of light,
entropy reverses itself.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Degeneration becomes
regeneration.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Disorganization
becomes reorganization.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Dis-ease becomes
healing or ease.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And so as we interact
with this light vibration,

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
it almost serves as a reminder
of who the truth of each

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us
is, of what the truth

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:90%
of each and every one of us is.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if subliminally,
a voice comes along and says,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:90%
hey, I remember this.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:90%
This is me vibrating as truth.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:84%
This is me vibrating as light.
-Right.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll do it again.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And as that person returns
to the natural vibration

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of their light, anything
denser than that light, which

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
tends to include pretty much
most of our health challenges

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:84%
has pretty much nothing
left to hold onto.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So if appropriate, for that
person on their life course,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:84%
as appropriate for that
person on their life course,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that health challenge, that
density simply falls away.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we get nothing else
out of this entire interview,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
let's try and take home
these next two sentences.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:84%
One, healing is just that
simple, and two, anything more

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:84%
complicated than
that-- crystals,

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:84%
pendulums, pendants,
protections, rituals,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
drops under the tongue, anything
more complicated than that is

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:90%
designed to sell us something.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying
that's not healing?

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is for
us to attain our highest

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:84%
level with true
healing, we can't be

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:90%
looking outside of ourselves.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:84%
We will attain steps,
training wheels, approaches.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
give me steps, you

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
could say, step
halfway, step halfway

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:90%
again, step halfway again.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is,
I'm getting closer.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Are these all wonderful things?
Do they help us?

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But once we master the
bicycle with training wheels,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.095 align:middle line:84%
do you really want to add a
second and third and fourth set

00:08:57.095 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:90%
of training wheels?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, one could say
that crystals and Reiki are

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:90%
light frequencies slowed down--

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they are.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:90%
 --or sped up.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they are
subsets of energy,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:84%
energy being a subset of
energy, light, and information.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:90%
They have been wonderful.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Do we want to stay there?

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to stay there or
are we here to become more?

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Can we step into becoming more?

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Is our life about
remaining in the same space

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
or is our life about
continual evolution,

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
stepping more and more into the
light of essence and essence

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:90%
of who we are.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:84%
When we are willing-- and
that's a keyword-- and able,

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:84%
but it has to do
with being willing,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to stop looking outside
of us for the answer,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
then we can turn around
and look back inside.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, and I
use Reiki generically,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
so we're not picking
on Reiki specifically--

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Any healing modality.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
 --as any energy
healing modality,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:84%
but we use Reiki as an
example because we've spoken

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:90%
about it so far.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
There are approximately,
I think last I heard,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:90%
32 different forms of Reiki.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Hard to find the original Reiki.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Yet, then there's the school
of Usui Reiki, which claims

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.760 align:middle line:84%
to be the original Reiki, yet
there are three schools of Usui

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Reiki all arguing over
who's the original Reiki

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
because they each have
different sets of symbols.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying is,
the symbols themselves

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
now by utilizing
them, we are still

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:90%
reaching outside of ourselves.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, for instance, we
want to study the heavens,

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:90%
so what's our first approach?

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:90%
A technique, maybe a telescope.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So we study and we focus
in on this part of the sky.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:90%
We see these stars.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We focus in on this
part, we see those.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
We focus in on that
part, we see those.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And we get to learn
subsets of the energies

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
of the field of the sky,
of stars, of the heavens.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
There's the
beautiful Reiki star.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
There's the perfect Qigong star.
There's this star.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:90%
There's that star.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain point
in time, our essence

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
wants to see the whole picture
and the only way we can do

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.880 align:middle line:84%
that is by placing the telescope
down, taking what we've learned

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and saying, now, how does
this all fit into one?

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like as we refer to
mastering the bicycle it's

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:84%
good to master the bicycle
with training wheels,

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
but now to truly master it, how
do we see the bigger picture?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:90%
How can we step out of it?

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Does it come from adding
a second and a third step

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:90%
of training wheels?

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Look at our religions.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.869 align:middle line:84%
-Modalities, yeah.
-Right.

00:11:44.869 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I view our religions
as different windows

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:90%
out into the universe.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
We oftentimes spend our entire
life looking out of one window,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe it shows a
church or a synagogue

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
or a mosque or a river, a
tree, a mountain, a stream.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Our families look out the same
window we have looked out of.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Then we meet someone who
claims that their window shows

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
something else
and the frightened

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:84%
part of our personality as
Gary Zukav would refer to it

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:84%
or the ego, doesn't
want to be wrong,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want our
family to be wrong.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:90%
So we argue over who's right.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.931 align:middle line:84%
We have wars and
so forth over that.

00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:13.685 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
-Right.

00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, eventually,
maybe we meet someone

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
who is not so threatening
who we truly appreciate.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.305 align:middle line:84%
They share with us what
they see from their window

00:12:20.305 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and we become safe
enough in their presence

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.225 align:middle line:84%
to allow ourselves to
look out of their window

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and we see there's more.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We start to recognize
now that the windows are

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
various different facets
to a diamond, the more

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:84%
the facets, the more the shine,
the more the beauty of diamond.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But even if we look out
of every single window,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
we'll never see
the whole picture

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:84%
because each windows
limited by the window

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
frame and each window frame
is limited by the wall

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:90%
that supports the frame.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So only once we're willing
to all join hands, go up

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:84%
on the roof and have
a party can we see

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:90%
360 degrees in all directions.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, who is the person who
limits their view even up

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:90%
at that party?

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:84%
The person who comes up carrying
part of their window frame.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
They're part of
their belief systems,

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:90%
part of their conditioning.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:90%
The part of the focusing in.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
The first gift that many people
have already been accessing

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
here when we just had
energy was to de-focus,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:84%
to release the
techniques, to practice

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:84%
without some of the symbols,
without some of the steps.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:84%
They were stepping into becoming
more of the energy themselves.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Now that we're able to move
beyond that energy, that energy

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
field, as we step into this,
we move beyond that energy

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
into the light and
the information.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The moment we go
back to technique

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
is the moment we start to
focus in on portions again.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the moment we join
the party on the roof

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:90%
with part of our window frame.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So basically what you're
saying is that we are all light

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency
that we heal in

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
is using that light
frequency to heal us,

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
essentially, is
what you're saying.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-OK.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what
reconnective healing is.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.099 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:59.099 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot give a
gift that we're unwilling

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:90%
to accept or receive ourselves.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything, every
choice we make in life

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
either comes from
fear, lack, limitation,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of
separation or darkness

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:84%
or from love, prosperity,
oneness, unity, and abundance.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:84%
We can't stand in fear
and accept or provide

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:90%
gifts that reside in love.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
We can't be protecting ourselves
in this flame and that flame

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and standing in fear, facilitate
healings that reside in love.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
We can't stand in
lack and limitation

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
using pendulums to protect
us from negative energies

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and other things to add
us more to make us more

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.595 align:middle line:84%
and then stand in
being in 100% abundance

00:14:42.595 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:90%
of providing the healings.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
At some point or other,
we are being looked

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:84%
upon by the universe to say,
can we accept without judgment

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:90%
where we had been.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Say, weren't these
training wheels wonderful?

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:90%
They've done their job now.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
We can even dip them in gold
and hang them up as a memory.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Can we bless them, thank
them, carry them with us

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
one step at a time,
carry our fears with us

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:84%
one step at a time
into the light

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and allow the light to do
what light does best, which

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:84%
is to show us that
the darkness never

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:90%
existed in the first place.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
connective healing

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:90%
basically connects us to.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is-- I wouldn't
say it's definitely

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
not a technique,
but it is a healing

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that you teach
people in seminars,

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.820 align:middle line:90%
in rooms, and so forth.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
How is it that you
teach people what is

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
originally their own essence?

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:90%
How do you re-teach that?

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have
multiple components that

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
are a little difficult
to comprehend, for me,

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:54.390 align:middle line:84%
as well as anyone because our
perspectives and our languaging

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:84%
come from a
four-dimensional basis.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Difficult to put into
words, these concepts.

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But in the seminar rooms,
the healing, it increases.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:90%
It's been shown scientifically--

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It's been shown by
research that it does.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if what
is happening is we

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:90%
are interacting with something.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And once we interact with it--
-The field.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:90%
 --it changes us.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:10%
We have a slide
of it, actually,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:10%
that shows that there is
an exponential increase

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:10%
of energy that happens
when the healing begins.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:10%
Well, you can see that here.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:10%
When we step into a room,
it has a normal space to it.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:10%
It's normal conditioning
is one of the phrases

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:10%
the researchers will use.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:10%
As we step into the reconnective
healing frequencies,

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:10%
the conditioning
rises to a new level.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
It raises to a new
level and then it

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.322 align:middle line:84%
maintains in that new
level and matter of fact,

00:16:53.322 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
it maintains long after
we leave the room.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So the space itself becomes
what some researchers say

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
is conditioned, some researchers
will call it duplexed,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:84%
some of the researchers have
slightly different names

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:84%
for it, but they say on
one level the only way

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:84%
that they can bring about
that level of excess-free,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:84%
thermodynamic energy
in the room would

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
be to raise the room
to almost 600 degrees

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Fahrenheit or approximately
300 degrees Celsius.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
How is it measured, what
they're talking about in terms

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:90%
of the increase in the room?

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.201 align:middle line:90%
How is it measured?

00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I can't really
explain how they do it.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how they do it.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Dr. William Tiller has done
it with some researchers.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Constantine
Korotkov has done it

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
with some different
research forms.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.755 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, Dr. Korotkov

00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:50.786 align:middle line:84%
has put out a book recently
that's available on Amazon.com

00:17:50.786 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's called of all things,
"Science Confirms Reconnective

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Healing," where he's
taken some of the research

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
of different well-known
international researchers

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and put them together and
collected them in the book.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Which is where the plant study
that you talked about where you

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
can actually cut the leaf and
have the reconnective healing

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
happen on it and the leaf
would grow without being

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:90%
connected to the plant.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Not being connected to plant.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I believe that study
is in the book also.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So what this does is there's
various different studies that

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
show the validation of
reconnective healing

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and its effectiveness and
its increase in frequency

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and energy and there's also
photography around it that

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:84%
shows that it
actually reconnects us

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to our original
state, our blueprint,

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
our original frequency,
our light being.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's one
slide-- I don't if you

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
have access to it--
where it shows the energy

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.160 align:middle line:90%
field around someone.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And here it is right here.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can see,
for instance, when

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.095 align:middle line:84%
we work with the Russian
Olympic athletes, the picture

00:18:55.095 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to the left or at
least to my left,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:84%
it says Before shows the
way the athletes' energy

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
field around them was
broken up or changed.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.620 align:middle line:84%
After working with
reconnective healing,

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
you see how they're field
came back into a fullness

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.780 align:middle line:90%
of health and abundance.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
This was not me doing
the reconnective healing

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:90%
and this is an important thing.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.210 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be healing, cannot
be about any one person.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:84%
What happened, the
history of this,

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
is that we flew to Russia
to teach a group of doctors.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:84%
In two afternoons, we
taught a group of doctors

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:90%
how to do this healing work.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
second afternoon,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
they were measured again
and so were the Russians

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Olympic athletes who
were the models that

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:90%
were used for the healing work.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And this was an example of,
I believe the average change

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:90%
in the athletes.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
What was very interesting is
that there's a bar graph that I

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
would have to go by memory on,
so we might not bother to use

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that one, but what
was interesting

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone after
the reconnective healing

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.470 align:middle line:84%
showed a dramatic increase
in their energy fields,

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:90%
their bioenergy fields.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Everyone did.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Everyone except one.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Now here's what was
interesting about it.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
During the time the people
were being measured,

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I looked way across the program
and it was a crowded room.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get across
the room and I couldn't

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
communicate with these people
anyway because they only

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.960 align:middle line:90%
spoke Russian.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And I see that one doctor
had taken his athlete,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
taken him to a
corner and started

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
trying to pull negative things
out of his energy fields

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and try to increase
things and decrease things

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and these are all the
things that we teach

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:90%
become limitations to the work.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned to Dr.
Korotkov, I said, you know,

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
this doctor across the
room is doing that.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:90%
It's going to skew our results.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:84%
It's going to alter
our results in a way

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that we really
don't want them to.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said let the
results be the results.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:84%
He came back with the result
and that was the only athlete

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and the only doctor--
-Interesting.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:84%
 --who had a decrease
after reconnective

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:90%
healing or after that weekend.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, well,
doesn't that ruin our data?

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:90%
He says, no.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It verifies exactly what you've
been teaching all these years,

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that the moment we add
fear, lack, and limitation

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:84%
or we take control and try to
change the effect of something,

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:84%
we move it away
from its perfection.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.717 align:middle line:90%
It's very--

00:21:33.717 --> 00:21:35.449 align:middle line:84%
- --very important right there.
-Right.

00:21:35.449 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult not to
because our techniques teach us

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that we are doing the healing
and therefore, unintentionally

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
feeds the ego in taking credit
for something that happens

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and what we're really being
offered the opportunity to rise

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to, is to allow ourselves
to become as Michael

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Beckwith from Agape
Church will say,

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
the observer and the observed,
to observe without judgment,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:90%
to witness without judgment.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we find
that there's actually more

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:84%
that comes in the reward
of the actual result

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:90%
than we could have created.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.140 align:middle line:84%
It's as if when our
people come in to us

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and they want to have healings
and I tell the practitioners,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, don't focus
on the problem

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that the reason the person
thinks that they're in there.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the
process, not the end

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
result, the process, not the
end result. If you're fortunate,

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:84%
you'll receive the healing
that you've come in intending,

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:84%
but if you're truly
fortunate, you'll

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:84%
receive one you
haven't even dreamed

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of that the universe has
designed specifically for you.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you're doing
they reconnective healing

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:84%
or you're teaching the
reconnective healing,

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:84%
are you intentionally imaging
light frequencies coming out

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
of your hand or is
this just to field

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:90%
that you're constantly in?

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
actually teaching it,

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:90%
what is it that you teach?

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:90%
How to feel it.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:90%
How to feel it.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:84%
In the feeling, what
we're really doing is

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
we're listening with
a different sense.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you recall the
sensation you had

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:90%
when I was doing this with you?

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and that's interesting.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.230 align:middle line:90%
So anybody could do this?

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just sitting here
and watching this right now?

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can learn to do this
once they interact with it.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:84%
It seems there are multiple
levels of requirement,

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I guess, that the universe
has set up hurdles for us

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.610 align:middle line:90%
to overcome to access this.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Hurdle number one is to step out
of the level of ego that says,

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:84%
oh, yes, there's something
new here on Earth

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:90%
and I can just om it in.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually, no.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying that so
you're entitled to the ocean,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
so you can go to the beach, sit
on the 24th floor in your hotel

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:48.850 align:middle line:90%
room and om the ocean in.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can om all day and
a, the ocean is not coming,

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.910 align:middle line:84%
or b, if it does,
you'd better run.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a tsunami.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
You actually have to put in your
spiritual little bathing suit

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and march across the beach
and into the water and then

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and only then can you become
equally as wet with ocean water

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.770 align:middle line:84%
This seems to require that we
are willing to place ourselves

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:84%
on an equivalent level with
another human being and say,

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I would like to access
this through you.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I would like to learn
this through you.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The ego that says I already have
it and I can do it on my own

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:84%
is precisely what's
limiting that person

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:90%
from ever truly accessing it.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to be
here as a reward

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
for us making certain
transcended moves.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:84%
You said that there are
other stages that you need

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
to go through in order
to access the energy,

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.630 align:middle line:84%
one is moving aside the ego and
being at one with the field.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:90%
What would the other ones be?

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:84%
One would be
allowing us to witness

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:90%
or observed without judgment.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:84%
One is us recognizing
that we have to interact

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
with another human
being that we haven't

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:90%
been reconnected in a dream.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Basically that's it.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Our willingness to listen,
our willingness to step out

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
of fear, lack, and limitation
and to step into that love,

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:90%
prosperity, and abundance.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot
of science that's

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:84%
being done around
reconnective healing

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and validating it
and verifying it.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Why do we need the science?

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
You're asking me
and I'm going to give

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:23.400 align:middle line:84%
you the answer that
the researchers

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:90%
aren't really excited with.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we need
it for any reason other

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:84%
than the fact that science is
studying reconnective healing

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.880 align:middle line:84%
seems to be what a
lot of people need

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:84%
to remove their blinders
to be willing to look

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:90%
at reconnective healing.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that it's being
studied shows that it's--

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:84%
It's more important
than the results.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It's nice that this is
showing dramatic results.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
strong distinctions

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
between reconnective healing and
energy healing and many of them

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
show up in the research and
many of them show up clinically.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, the healings tend
to be fairly instantaneous.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:90%
They tend to be lifelong.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
They tend to bring about
changes in light emissions

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
from the body, in
changes in the DNA,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.980 align:middle line:84%
in the temperatures in the
rooms on different levels

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.680 align:middle line:90%
on different fields.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:90%
But does that really matter?

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever intuitively
connect with somebody

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.860 align:middle line:84%
in terms of psychically when
you're experiencing any type

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:90%
of reconnective healing?

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Does that have anything
to do with that?

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Is it a different plane?

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:90%
I have and people do.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't tend to talk about it.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.787 align:middle line:84%
I don't tend to bill
it, but I will--

00:26:38.787 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
When reconnective healing
first appeared here,

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
even chiropractors were having
trouble getting into hospitals.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.679 align:middle line:84%
Right.
OK.

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And here I am
now, you know, I've

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
trained how many tens of
thousands of medical doctors

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and nurses and researchers
and such how to do this work.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:13.150 align:middle line:84%
It does increase our
multi-dimensional awareness,

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
which we could take as
a natural state as I do

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:84%
or as many people tend
to want to do to make

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:84%
it about making them
special and say, yes,

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.180 align:middle line:90%
I've become a psychic.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:90%
I've become a medical intuitive.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I hear the tones.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I, I, I me, me, me.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It's all about me and
the point is it's not.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:90%
We are stepping into 2012.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.900 align:middle line:84%
We are living in the
war-torn results of what's

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.100 align:middle line:84%
been happening from
us being raised

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
to look at what makes
each and every one of us

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:90%
different and unique.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are here today
to rise above that and to say,

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:90%
what makes us all the same.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Basically to reconnect.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
To recognize that
when one child

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.516 align:middle line:84%
cries in one part of the
world, a hundred children

00:28:05.516 --> 00:28:06.215 align:middle line:90%
weep in another.

00:28:06.215 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
When one child laughs, a
thousand laugh somewhere else,

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are that connected.
-Yes.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:84%
That gives you a sense
of awe and responsibility

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
take a quick break.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.460 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're
going to talk about how

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
reconnective healing
is being used

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.220 align:middle line:84%
with different communities,
with children, with pets,

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
with all sorts of
different communities.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.021 align:middle line:84%
We will be right
back with Eric Pearl.

00:28:32.021 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.070 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:90%
My guest is Eric Pearl.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
reconnective healing,

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
basically reconnecting
us to the source

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that we are, basically
like frequency.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So you talked
earlier about entropy

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and when things breakdown,
that's the lack of connection.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if the
opposite of that happens?

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we are
in that state of coherence,

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.570 align:middle line:84%
when we are in that
state of reconnection?

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:90%
What happens to us physically?

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.460 align:middle line:90%
How does the healing begin?

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:32.480 align:middle line:10%
Our DNA, light emissions,
all rise to an optimal level.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.050 align:middle line:10%
In that vibration of light,
anything denser or heavier

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:10%
than light, as we've said,
has nothing left to hold onto,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:10%
so it pretty much falls away.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We vibrate in that
natural state.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we
interact with this-- well,

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.550 align:middle line:84%
you see, the body doesn't
heal the way we were taught.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:84%
We were taught
that the body heals

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:56.040 align:middle line:84%
through biochemical changes
and today, in medicine,

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:90%
that model is pretty much dead.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We know that the body
heals through vibration,

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:84%
energy, frequency, resonance,
entrainment, and light.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
biochemical model

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.870 align:middle line:84%
couldn't explain how
something could happen

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:84%
in one part of your body
immediately effect something

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.920 align:middle line:90%
in another part of your body.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Light waves are part
of what we accept

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:90%
as that explanation today.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Our brains don't work
the way we were taught.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Remember the old
models of the brain.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.500 align:middle line:84%
You'd see a model of a brain
sitting on a stick on a desk

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and there'd be circles
in different areas

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is memory, this is
learning, this is speech.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:33.670 align:middle line:84%
We know now today from the work
of Dr. Karl Lashley and Karl

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Pribram and others that
this information is not

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.340 align:middle line:84%
sitting around in little
sequestered areas,

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
it's diffused
throughout the brain

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and that we access
it from that field.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, well, let's
look at this analogy.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Computers, we all
have computers.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:90%
What's a computer?

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:84%
By itself, it's a
little metal box.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:90%
It does nothing.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Put a software program
into it, you get

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.980 align:middle line:84%
information from the computer--
-Systems

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.880 align:middle line:84%
 --then you access
information from that internet

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:90%
field out there somewhere.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.865 align:middle line:84%
Upgrade the software,
better access

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:09.020 align:middle line:84%
to the information
within, better

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.250 align:middle line:90%
access to the internet field.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, I can understand that.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if our brains are
our hardware, what if our DNA is

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
our software, and what if we
are doing what five research

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:84%
studies so far say
that we are doing,

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:84%
which is restructuring the DNA
or what I like to say from what

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.590 align:middle line:84%
we talked about in the earlier
interview, what you're doing

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:90%
is reconnecting strands.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:90%
We're reconnecting the DNA.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:46.340 align:middle line:84%
In this interaction, when you
feel this, in essence, what

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:51.070 align:middle line:84%
we're doing is we're
facilitating with one another

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:84%
in the shared interaction
a human software upgrade

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
that allows for better
access for the information

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.940 align:middle line:84%
within the brain and more
multi-dimensional access

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:90%
of that field.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So since we go where
our attention is,

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.430 align:middle line:84%
this is us standing on
the precipice of becoming

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.480 align:middle line:90%
more evolved as human beings.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:84%
What happens though
when someone is in pain

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and where medical science
does explain when you have

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:84%
certain amino acid chain
reactions and precursors that

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:24.800 align:middle line:84%
develop pain, serotonin,
dopamine, whatever, how do you

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.640 align:middle line:84%
explain reconnective healing
where it comes to someone being

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.920 align:middle line:84%
in physical pain who needs
to heal their body, whose

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:90%
body needs to be healed?

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Science has discovered
different parts

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.600 align:middle line:90%
of what goes on in the process.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like
taking stop photography.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, here's a
picture, here's a picture,

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.760 align:middle line:90%
here's a picture.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:84%
What reconnective healing is
about is allowing the body

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.240 align:middle line:84%
to return to that
state of balance

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and within that
state of balance,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:90%
you can take stop photography.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, those
things are happening,

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't heal
because of biochemicals.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.270 align:middle line:84%
The biochemical
changes are a result

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.980 align:middle line:84%
of interacting
with or in training

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.020 align:middle line:84%
with a more comprehensive
intelligence, the energy,

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.080 align:middle line:84%
the light, the information
that allows the body to return

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:90%
to a state of balance.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.405 align:middle line:84%
See the body doesn't need
anything added into it.

00:33:22.405 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:90%
The body is created perfectly.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:84%
If we have chronic
headaches, it is

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:84%
not because we were born with
the blood aspirin deficiency.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:84%
It means something is out
balance as an interference

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:90%
with our body balancing itself.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:84%
What reconnective
healing does is

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:42.860 align:middle line:84%
it brings the body back
into a level of vibration

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
where the interferences
fall away.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't address the headache.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't see someone because
they've got a back ache,

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:84%
because they have
cancer, because they've

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:90%
this, that, or the other.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:84%
You see someone because
they want to return

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.720 align:middle line:90%
to a better state of balance.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not treatment.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not therapy.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not cures.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Those are areas for
medicine and related fields.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:90%
But can you do it on yourself?

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you learn the
technique and you're

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:84%
having pain or
experience or if you

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%
have something
imbalanced in your body,

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:90%
can you do it yourself?

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can do it
on yourself and you

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:90%
don't address the symptom.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I know that this
is a tricky aspect.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult aspect because
we are attached to our symptoms

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
because these are the indicators
that something is wrong

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and when we try to work
to get rid of a symptom,

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:40.010 align:middle line:84%
we don't always realize that
we're becoming result oriented.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.909 align:middle line:84%
We're not oriented
in the process.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:84%
The process is about
returning to healing.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:84%
So let's use a more
physical example.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you go to your
home, you open the front door.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Smoke is billowing out.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:84%
You feel heat, you
walk into the kitchen,

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and the smoke
detector is going off.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you grab a scissors,
cut the wires, and sit down

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:90%
and say, thank god.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I hated that noise?

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Of course not,
but that's what we

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.470 align:middle line:84%
do when we swallow an
aspirin, for instance,

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.160 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of the symptom.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:16.500 align:middle line:84%
We can in the very same way
limit what we're bringing

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.900 align:middle line:84%
through and it becomes
spiritual bottles of aspirin

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.540 align:middle line:84%
saying I've got a
problem in my elbow.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Let me bring my
hand over my elbow.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have the
problem in the elbow?

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Why is there a problem in
the kidney, for example?

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.965 align:middle line:84%
It's an imbalance
somewhere in the system

00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and an imbalance in
the system is often

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:40.950 align:middle line:90%
an imbalance within our fields.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a kind
of an example that's

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:90%
sort of easy to understand.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll take it physically and
then we'll move it spiritually.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Physically let's say
there's a football player,

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.050 align:middle line:84%
injures his knee on
the playing field.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.830 align:middle line:90%
There's swelling.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:57.710 align:middle line:90%
There's heat.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.160 align:middle line:84%
There's altered
function, redness.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:90%
There's pain.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.520 align:middle line:90%
What is the pain?

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
The pain is the knee
picking up the telephone

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.530 align:middle line:84%
system calling up
to the brain saying

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:90%
help me, help me, help me.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:09.323 align:middle line:90%
There's damage down here.

00:36:09.323 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And the brain says, OK,
I've got you covered.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:13.530 align:middle line:84%
First thing I'm going to do
is we're going to increase

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:90%
the blood flow to the knee.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to wash away
the damaged tissue, which

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.090 align:middle line:84%
will also bring more redness to
the area and increase the heat.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.800 align:middle line:84%
At the raised
temperature level, there

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:84%
will be different
biochemical functions

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:84%
to help the healing process
go on over the next few days.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:90%
They'll be temperature changes.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.340 align:middle line:84%
We'll also bring healing
nutrient fluids and swelling

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and density to the
knee to protect it

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.380 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't over
move and damage itself

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.520 align:middle line:90%
in it's weakened condition.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you push
through that, we'll

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.360 align:middle line:84%
set up an outer perimeter of
pain to remind you to, hey,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:90%
knock it off.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.654 align:middle line:84%
We're going to stay
on this phone call

00:36:44.654 --> 00:36:45.620 align:middle line:90%
till the healing is complete.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.051 align:middle line:84%
We'll say thank you very much.
Goodbye.

00:36:47.051 --> 00:36:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Click.
-Very well said.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
-What is that?

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:49.989 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:36:49.989 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the intelligence,
that's the perfect intelligence

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.460 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
demonstrating itself

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:84%
through the innate
intelligence--

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:55.850 align:middle line:90%
 --of the body.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, what might not
be so intelligent

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:84%
would be to take that
athlete, place them

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
on a physical
therapy table, take

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:84%
an artificial, electrical
current such as ultrasound,

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.720 align:middle line:84%
short circuit the phone call
between the knee and the brain

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:84%
so the knee is hollering
help, help, help,

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.320 align:middle line:90%
but the brain hears hm.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:90%
So it hangs up the phone.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We inject painkillers
and anti inflammatories

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and send the guy back out in
the playing field pain free

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:24.370 align:middle line:84%
but not healed so the knee
is continually degenerating,

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.120 align:middle line:90%
but no indicator.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we can understand this,
then the next logical question

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:84%
is, is the intelligence
of the universe

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.380 align:middle line:84%
any less intelligent
off the body

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.220 align:middle line:90%
than it is within the body?

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, our
energy healing techniques

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:84%
tell us to come in and
look at the chakras

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and if some of the chakras
are spinning clockwise

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and others are counterclockwise,
we get them all

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.350 align:middle line:90%
to spin in the same direction.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Look at the colors
and the energy fields

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and if the blue and the green
and the red is out of position,

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.190 align:middle line:84%
remove the red and re-balance
the blue and the green.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Look for the areas of
density, remove the density

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.000 align:middle line:90%
so everything flows freely.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:84%
It sounds lovely, but
let's think about it.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:90%
What are we really doing?

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:07.060 align:middle line:84%
When we step in and we start
to restructure the direction

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that the chakras
are spinning in,

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.970 align:middle line:84%
what makes us think that
those changes in direction

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:84%
are any less intelligent than
the redirection of the blood

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.230 align:middle line:84%
flow within the human body to
the injured football player?

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.410 align:middle line:84%
When we step in and
rearrange the colors

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:84%
in the aura system, what makes
us think those color changes?

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Or if there's an area of red
that doesn't normally belong,

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:84%
what makes us
think it's any less

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.960 align:middle line:90%
intelligent than the red knee.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:84%
But we remove a density so
everything flows freely again,

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:84%
what makes us think that
density is any less intelligent

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:84%
than the swelling protecting the
knee to keep you from injuring

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:90%
it when you're doing it?

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
is it that that energy

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.280 align:middle line:84%
healing approach is really
announcing to the universe?

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's hear it
in a human voice.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:53.090 align:middle line:84%
What that person is saying
is thanks a lot, god.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Looks like you've done
a pretty small job

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
with most of the
universe up until now,

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:90%
but you've missed these spots.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Please allow me to
fix them for you.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.285 align:middle line:84%
By the way, here's my pink
business card with the rainbows

00:39:02.285 --> 00:39:02.984 align:middle line:90%
and the fairies.

00:39:02.984 --> 00:39:04.440 align:middle line:84%
It lists all the
various energy healing

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.020 align:middle line:90%
techniques I've ever mastered.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Feel free to call on me again.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.690 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I would love to
stay and talk a little longer,

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.324 align:middle line:84%
but I only have enough time to
email everyone I've ever known,

00:39:13.324 --> 00:39:14.590 align:middle line:84%
tell them what I've
just down for you,

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and make it to the class
I'm teaching tonight

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.810 align:middle line:90%
on how to transcend your ego.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.170 align:middle line:84%
By the way, god, you
might want to come.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.150 align:middle line:84%
There's always something
for everyone to learn.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.644 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:23.644 --> 00:39:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are not bad people
functioning out of integrity.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.240 align:middle line:90%
We're trying.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:38.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not necessarily fully
consciously aware of what we're

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:84%
doing and sometimes
it can be a little

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.990 align:middle line:90%
discomforting to have to look.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's a challenge.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.250 align:middle line:84%
We have to be brave
enough to really look,

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:84%
but can we recognize
that our words need to be

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle line:90%
in integrity with our actions?

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to talk
about transcending the ego

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.750 align:middle line:84%
without being willing to
look at our actions and say,

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:05.360 align:middle line:84%
are our actions matching
the word of this.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Are we willing to rise to a
level of becoming the observer

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and the observed, the
witness and the witness,

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.130 align:middle line:84%
the seer and the seen, to
observe without judgment

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.035 align:middle line:84%
and see where the actual
beauty of healing comes in.

00:40:18.035 --> 00:40:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It does seem incredibly
simple, but that, of course,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.150 align:middle line:84%
is your whole point is it
is simple to re-balance

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to that state.
-And challenging.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it takes practice
and it shows up though when you

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:84%
have reconnective kids and when
you are teaching kids how to do

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.780 align:middle line:84%
this and the kids
themselves can learn

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.990 align:middle line:90%
these techniques because--

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Faster.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Faster.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Faster.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.020 align:middle line:84%
For adults, the course
is like a Friday

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:90%
night, Saturday, and Sunday.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.590 align:middle line:84%
For children, instead
of 2 and 1/2 days,

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.820 align:middle line:84%
two 2 and 1/2 hours
because they don't come

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.260 align:middle line:90%
in with the ego to overcome.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.700 align:middle line:84%
We view our kids as if
they're empty vessels

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.930 align:middle line:84%
placed here on
Earth for us to fill

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:90%
with everything that we know.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe it's time
for us to view them

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.820 align:middle line:84%
as empty vessels placed
here on the planet for us

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to become empty
vessels ourselves once again.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.050 align:middle line:84%
The children learn
it beautifully.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a video of
this, of reconnective healing

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.193 align:middle line:90%
with kids in their own voices.

00:41:14.193 --> 00:41:15.592 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Real kids.

00:41:15.592 --> 00:41:16.332 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:41:16.332 --> 00:41:19.068 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:19.068 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to access
healing without having

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.650 align:middle line:90%
to learn any steps.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.180 align:middle line:84%
This is more than
energy healing.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.590 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Reconnective healing is a
new form of healing here

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.935 align:middle line:84%
on the planet for
what the researchers

00:41:35.935 --> 00:41:37.700 align:middle line:90%
think is the very first time.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.641 align:middle line:84%
So when we help others
with their healings,

00:41:42.641 --> 00:41:44.605 align:middle line:90%
we become better ourselves.

00:41:44.605 --> 00:41:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Because this is us vibrating
at a level of light.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.455 align:middle line:84%
We're here to be the
light that inspires

00:41:51.455 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the light in each
person that comes along

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and the children of
the light that show us.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday 114 of our
children had a chance

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:84%
to participate in the
reconnective healing program

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.625 align:middle line:90%
by Dr. Eric Pearl.

00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:05.560 align:middle line:84%
We're able to tap
into our children's

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.550 align:middle line:90%
natural healing ability.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.756 align:middle line:84%
We at the reconnection
know something

00:42:08.756 --> 00:42:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the adults
aren't quite sure of

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.109 align:middle line:84%
and that is, the adults tend to
view those of us who are still

00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:20.680 align:middle line:84%
kids as being
empty little things

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that they need to fill with
everything that they know.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:28.212 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, we're
emptying in the way of being

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:32.326 align:middle line:84%
able to receive
everything and this

00:42:32.326 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:84%
is why you will learn healing
more easily and more quickly.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.240 align:middle line:84%
What happens in the
seminars that we teach you

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:84%
how to access this
broader, more comprehensive

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:47.130 align:middle line:90%
spectrum of healing.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, some woman
had costochondritis.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I just touched her on her
shoulder and she felt better.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.266 align:middle line:90%
How long does the healing take?

00:42:55.266 --> 00:42:56.172 align:middle line:90%
This long.

00:42:56.172 --> 00:42:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I learned to be
one with myself.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.624 align:middle line:90%
It was like a dream almost.

00:43:00.624 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:84%
ERIC: Look at how the
involuntary muscles move

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.770 align:middle line:90%
around the nose and the mouth.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:08.140 align:middle line:84%
We're inherently healthy
and we're inherently whole.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.115 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in
looking into it myself.

00:43:10.115 --> 00:43:13.785 align:middle line:84%
You could feel something
through your hands

00:43:13.785 --> 00:43:17.665 align:middle line:84%
when you circle your
hands around and around.

00:43:17.665 --> 00:43:18.635 align:middle line:90%
What did it feel like?

00:43:18.635 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:84%
It feels like tingly
sparkles and stuff.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.900 align:middle line:84%
That we're all more
than just humans.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.593 align:middle line:84%
We can all be healers
just like Dr. Pearl.

00:43:29.593 --> 00:43:34.483 align:middle line:84%
You have this gift
to share with people.

00:43:34.483 --> 00:43:38.884 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to hear about it,
it's another thing to feel it.

00:43:38.884 --> 00:43:44.571 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.571 --> 00:43:46.340 align:middle line:84%
[END VIDEO]
-Beautiful.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely beautiful.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.230 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful to see
kids where they're

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.160 align:middle line:90%
so in such a pure state.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So does it take any certain
type of belief system?

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It didn't with these children.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they don't
have indoctrinated

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.860 align:middle line:90%
belief systems at that age.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.110 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to do
with faith, hope, or belief.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Nothing to do with mind over
matter, hypnosis, anticipation.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.590 align:middle line:84%
When these healings
first started,

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.710 align:middle line:84%
my patients were coming
in to see a chiropractor

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:14.160 align:middle line:90%
and I thought I was one.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.647 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's kind of hard--
-Well, you were.

00:44:15.647 --> 00:44:16.780 align:middle line:84%
 --to vet a
double-blinded study.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:17.479 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:17.479 --> 00:44:20.930 align:middle line:84%
No one was anticipating
or hoping or expecting.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And the healing
started to happen.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, as word
got out about the healings,

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.540 align:middle line:84%
people started coming from
halfway around the world,

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.110 align:middle line:84%
not always of
their own volition.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Often they were pulled,
pushed, dragged,

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:36.760 align:middle line:84%
or shoved, by a well-meaning
friend or relative.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.467 align:middle line:84%
They'd sit in front of me in
the room when they'd show up

00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say, I
want you to know

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.530 align:middle line:90%
that I don't believe in it.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a pile of garbage.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.910 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't be here if my husband
or wife didn't make me come.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:48.660 align:middle line:10%
And I would explain to them
because my office at that time

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.950 align:middle line:10%
was still in LA, I
would say, listen,

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.660 align:middle line:10%
you left whatever
country you've come from,

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:10%
you've flown to Los
Angeles for a week,

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:58.840 align:middle line:10%
taken time off from work.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not,
actually, worse things

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.610 align:middle line:90%
do happen to some people.

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you just
say to yourself, maybe

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.070 align:middle line:84%
it's real, maybe
isn't, but whatever

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.540 align:middle line:84%
it is, it's a rare
opportunity to lie

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.340 align:middle line:84%
down in the middle of
the day for 30 minutes

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and rest your eyes.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.060 align:middle line:90%
So shut up and take it.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.565 align:middle line:84%
Which is what you did
when you originally

00:45:13.565 --> 00:45:15.200 align:middle line:90%
received the communication.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And so these people would very
often receive some extremely

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.130 align:middle line:90%
dramatic healings.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.430 align:middle line:84%
If anyone didn't
receive a healing,

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:28.450 align:middle line:84%
it tended not to be the
person who didn't believe in.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It tended more to be the person
who believed in it too much,

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.260 align:middle line:84%
the person came in
saying, I know this works.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.140 align:middle line:90%
It has to work.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.220 align:middle line:90%
I have high expectations.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.621 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I've got every crystal
over the right chakra

00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:38.320 align:middle line:90%
in my body.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm sleeping with all the proper
healing books under my pillow.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm only turning in clockwise
circles from full moon

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.070 align:middle line:84%
to full moon and this
month is the blue moon.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to fix
all of my problems.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:50.780 align:middle line:84%
They were so attached to needing
that healing that attachment

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.970 align:middle line:84%
became the constriction,
became the glass

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:54.800 align:middle line:90%
ceiling or the limitation.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.200 align:middle line:84%
The person who didn't believe
in it in the first place,

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:02.050 align:middle line:84%
well, it's sort of hard
to attach to something

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:03.760 align:middle line:90%
if you don't believe it exists.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.840 align:middle line:84%
This is something that as we've
talked about, as we've seen

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.910 align:middle line:90%
in the research, simply is.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It's as if I place this glass
of water on to the table,

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:84%
the table will catch
the water and I

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.260 align:middle line:84%
can pretty much promise
you that the water

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.050 align:middle line:90%
does not believe in the table.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about
if this really were

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.930 align:middle line:84%
completely effective,
how come everyone

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.340 align:middle line:90%
isn't being healed from it?

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's
completely effective?

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.699 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean by
completely effective?

00:46:30.699 --> 00:46:31.865 align:middle line:84%
You tell me what
you mean then I'll

00:46:31.865 --> 00:46:32.898 align:middle line:90%
tell you what I think you mean.

00:46:32.898 --> 00:46:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I guess result producing.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.030 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:40.450 align:middle line:84%
What if this didn't bring-- if
this is completely effective,

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:47.200 align:middle line:84%
what you're really
asking is, does this

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.030 align:middle line:84%
bring about the
physical results that we

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.240 align:middle line:84%
in our limited conscious,
human, educated mind

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.860 align:middle line:90%
think should come about.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.740 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.280 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't always.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.280 align:middle line:84%
We really don't understand
the mind of God.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.340 align:middle line:84%
A perfect example,
one from the book

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.240 align:middle line:84%
was that a woman
drove 3,000 miles

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.010 align:middle line:84%
across the country to see
me from the east coast to LA

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:11.890 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:13.110 align:middle line:90%
She had had Bell's palsy.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:14.737 align:middle line:84%
It affected one
side of her face.

00:47:14.737 --> 00:47:15.970 align:middle line:90%
All of her muscles had drooped.

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The Bell's palsy went away,
but the side of her face

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.570 align:middle line:84%
was sensitive for
years afterwards

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.360 align:middle line:90%
to any little light breeze.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.090 align:middle line:90%
She flew in to have that change.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I did a healing with her.
I did two of them.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:90%
It didn't go away.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:32.760 align:middle line:84%
We could say she
didn't have a healing.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:38.530 align:middle line:84%
What she didn't tell me about
until afterwards was when

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.160 align:middle line:84%
she was a young girl,
maybe 9, 10, 11,

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and she was at
this point in time

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.760 align:middle line:84%
in her upper 40s towards
50, she had an infection

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:53.030 align:middle line:90%
and lost the hearing in one ear.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:55.180 align:middle line:84%
All of her life, she was
without the hearing in that ear.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.470 align:middle line:90%
She didn't expect to heal.

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.280 align:middle line:90%
She didn't tell me about it.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Her hearing returned.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.640 align:middle line:90%
Did she have a healing?

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, if she had never
shared that with me

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and if I were attached
to the result,

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.740 align:middle line:84%
then I would think that
woman didn't have a healing.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But if we step back three
feet or three feet again

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and we see the larger
picture, we see a healing.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a film called
"The Living Matrix."

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:19.300 align:middle line:84%
In "The Living Matrix,"
in a condensed form,

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.470 align:middle line:84%
it opens up with the
story of the Greek boy who

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:26.610 align:middle line:84%
was unable to walk or talk, use
his hand, was carried up to me,

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:30.260 align:middle line:90%
metal braces on his legs.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It was after an event, the
place was about to close,

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:34.640 align:middle line:84%
they'd asked if
I'd do a healing.

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I started to do a healing.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Four minutes into it, they
told us we had to leave.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:39.490 align:middle line:90%
The place was closing.

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.160 align:middle line:84%
The little boy, for the
first time in his life,

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.970 align:middle line:84%
got up without the braces,
walked down the stairs,

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:84%
ascended the full staircase
of this miniature coliseum

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.740 align:middle line:90%
in Greece, not once but twice.

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Later on that week
was brought to see me.

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:53.010 align:middle line:90%
He said, look what I can do.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I can stand on one leg and
spin in a complete circle.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, I can run up and down
the hallway, he showed me.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I can open my right hand
and hold my own cup of water

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and I can hug my parents with
both arms just like a big boy.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment
it became clear.

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.910 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in his life,
he was able to speak clearly

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and everyone could
understand him.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.300 align:middle line:84%
We could stop there
and say, wow, what

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.180 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful physical healing.

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting is, in
the film "The Living Matrix,"

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.760 align:middle line:84%
you'll see this boy being
interviewed and his mother.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.110 align:middle line:90%
You won't see his father.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:28.930 align:middle line:84%
We were going to do this
interview, scheduled

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.180 align:middle line:90%
it about four different times.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.970 align:middle line:84%
We were going to fly
to Greece to do it.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:34.605 align:middle line:84%
The father kept canceling,
taking his permission back.

00:49:34.605 --> 00:49:36.340 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want
anything to do with it.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.331 align:middle line:84%
Finally when he gave
us permission, again,

00:49:38.331 --> 00:49:39.030 align:middle line:90%
we flew over.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:40.390 align:middle line:84%
The father left
the house, wouldn't

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.300 align:middle line:84%
come back till the
filming was done,

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.760 align:middle line:90%
didn't want any parts of it.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.140 align:middle line:84%
When we had the premiere
for the film in London,

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.910 align:middle line:84%
we invited the
family out thinking

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:51.335 align:middle line:84%
only the mother and child would
come, but the father came.

00:49:51.335 --> 00:49:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the way,
when the mother was

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.240 align:middle line:84%
about to take the seminar
immediately finding

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.550 align:middle line:84%
this healing, we
said why don't you

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:59.430 align:middle line:84%
bring little Demetrius, the
boy, and share it with everyone

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:00.550 align:middle line:90%
next weekend at the seminar.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.081 align:middle line:84%
And she said the
strangest thing.

00:50:02.081 --> 00:50:02.780 align:middle line:90%
She said, no.

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to get a false hope.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.930 align:middle line:90%
I didn't give it much thought.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a strange
response, but she's the mother.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.640 align:middle line:84%
A year later, in
the green room right

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.740 align:middle line:84%
before the premiere of the
film then I meet the father.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.570 align:middle line:84%
The father said to me,
I didn't want Demetrius

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.390 align:middle line:84%
to do this film
because I didn't want

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:22.010 align:middle line:90%
to believe he had a healing.

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.990 align:middle line:90%
But he did have a healing.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:25.450 align:middle line:84%
He runs and walks and plays
and speaks normally now.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.300 align:middle line:84%
He runs all the time because
he didn't get a chance

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.340 align:middle line:90%
to before with his friends.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.450 align:middle line:90%
He's only five years old.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want to
believe that he had healing

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.950 align:middle line:84%
because if I had to believe
that he had a healing,

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I would have to live with the
fear of waking up every morning

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and one morning
it could be gone.

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I suddenly realized
what the mother meant.

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I found out that family almost
divorced over that film.

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, no family divorces
over one issue.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there
were other issues.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.780 align:middle line:84%
They almost divorced
over that film.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.640 align:middle line:84%
The mother is now a
practitioner and the family

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.490 align:middle line:84%
is the strongest
unit it's ever been

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:00.880 align:middle line:90%
and this has been for years.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Who had the healing?

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Did that little boy
have a physical haling?

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.740 align:middle line:84%
That entire family
had a healing.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:12.180 align:middle line:84%
We looked at a symptom at an
anticipated result thinking

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:14.120 align:middle line:84%
we understand the mind
of God and that we

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:17.930 align:middle line:84%
see the whole picture and that
determines in our mind's eye

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.280 align:middle line:84%
whether or not that
person has a healing.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell
you, the true gift

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.140 align:middle line:84%
of who receives
the healing is us,

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:29.010 align:middle line:84%
being so privileged and honored
as being able to witness

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:32.340 align:middle line:84%
the healings and then seeing
if we can challenge ourselves

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.010 align:middle line:84%
to step back and start
to see the healing

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:38.530 align:middle line:84%
resonate in the larger
and larger picture.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So let go of our expectations,
let go of the labels

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:47.424 align:middle line:84%
that we want to put on
things, and let us be

00:51:47.424 --> 00:51:48.390 align:middle line:90%
at the effect of the healing.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:55.110 align:middle line:84%
When I do this work-- hold
your hand out for me-- I step in

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and I allow myself to feel.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Where's my attention?

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:02.820 align:middle line:84%
My focus is not
on the end result.

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying will this heal?

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Will that heal?

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Will the other heal?

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.280 align:middle line:84%
My focus is on
what am I feeling.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.470 align:middle line:90%
What am I seeing?

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Am I feeling sensations?

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Am I seeing response?

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:18.030 align:middle line:84%
When I'm doing this, where
am I keeping my attention?

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm allowing myself
to recognize that I

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.010 align:middle line:90%
have one role as a healer.

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:24.815 align:middle line:90%
That role is to open a door.

00:52:24.815 --> 00:52:27.990 align:middle line:84%
It is the role of
the other person

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:31.530 align:middle line:84%
to have the courage to choose
to walk through that door.

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:35.140 align:middle line:84%
My role is to open the
door, not with my right hand

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and push them through with my
left hand to get the result

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:39.510 align:middle line:90%
that I think that they need.

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:42.740 align:middle line:84%
My role is to open the door
and allow them to walk through.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.390 align:middle line:84%
If you take your friend and drop
them off at a shopping center

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and wait in the car,
your responsibility

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:53.530 align:middle line:84%
is not what they come out of
that shopping center with.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, as healers, we feel
responsible for the result.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:58.970 align:middle line:90%
We open the door with one hand.

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:00.410 align:middle line:84%
We push them through
with the other hand.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.675 align:middle line:90%
We cheat them--

00:53:01.675 --> 00:53:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And us.

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.390 align:middle line:84%
 --out of stepping into their
own healing and us out of being

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:09.640 align:middle line:84%
able to witness that and the
more that we allow ourselves

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.090 align:middle line:84%
to witness, then the
more we step into a state

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:18.700 align:middle line:84%
of knowingness and mastery, then
the more we are able to better

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.720 align:middle line:84%
able open the door and the
more and better able people

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.530 align:middle line:90%
are to walk through that door.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:28.110 align:middle line:84%
In our seeing lies
our knowingness.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And now our knowingness
lies our ability

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:35.070 align:middle line:84%
to see more and in the
two lies our mastery.

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.360 align:middle line:90%
This is our challenge.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You must know that
you are a master.

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.010 align:middle line:84%
You must see that
you are a master.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the seeing
and the knowingness,

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:47.501 align:middle line:84%
we allow other people to
step up into their own level

00:53:47.501 --> 00:53:48.200 align:middle line:90%
of healing.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.941 align:middle line:84%
I believe we are standing on
the precipice of human evolution

00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:53.200 align:middle line:84%
here.
This is not about the healings.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The physical healings
are this big.

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:57.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like walking past a
Mrs. Fields cookie shop

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and you smell the white
chocolate macadamia nuts.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It grabs you by the nose,
pulls you into the store,

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.780 align:middle line:84%
then you find there's
something else.

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:07.070 align:middle line:84%
The physical healing
is what draws us in,

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.890 align:middle line:84%
but I believe that
what's happening

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:13.200 align:middle line:84%
is that we are restructuring
and we're reconnecting the DNA.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.030 align:middle line:84%
We are allowing
ourselves to become

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.490 align:middle line:90%
more multidimensionally aware.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And since we go where
our attention is,

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:84%
we are stepping in
to becoming more

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:23.530 align:middle line:90%
multi-dimensional human beings.

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.720 align:middle line:84%
This is not about
just physical healing,

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.570 align:middle line:84%
this is about our
reconnection as humanity.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's not an accident that
it's come at this time where

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:35.510 align:middle line:84%
there is such an intentionality
on the focus of time

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:37.110 align:middle line:84%
speeding up, things
are shifting,

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:38.740 align:middle line:90%
the shifts that are occurring.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So do you believe that this
has come in at this time

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.132 align:middle line:90%
specifically?

00:54:44.132 --> 00:54:44.990 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.860 align:middle line:90%
You said the evolution.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But I want to be careful
that we don't think

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:52.050 align:middle line:84%
of this as being a 2012
thing because there's

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:54.490 align:middle line:90%
more coming after 2012.

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:57.360 align:middle line:84%
On December 21, we're not going
to lift up the bed sheets,

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.840 align:middle line:84%
look underneath and
scream because we're

00:54:58.840 --> 00:54:59.780 align:middle line:90%
suddenly invisible.

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.014 align:middle line:84%
We might scream
for another reason.

00:55:01.014 --> 00:55:02.280 align:middle line:84%
We'll save that for
another interview.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Another show.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.025 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:55:04.025 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:84%
But we will look back in
3 years, 6 years, 12 years

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.455 align:middle line:84%
and say look at the
evolution of human kind.

00:55:09.455 --> 00:55:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But by then, we will be
moving into our next level

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:14.570 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:17.030 align:middle line:84%
We will be learning
to remove more

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and more of the
training wheels and step

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.240 align:middle line:90%
into becoming the healing.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So we no longer need
to do the healing

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and as we become the healing,
we become our own evolution.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:30.220 align:middle line:84%
We become the reminder
of others light vibration

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and they step in to our
inch of their evolution.

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you
speak to someone who's

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:84%
had a life after
death experience

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and they often say as they're
moving towards the light,

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.030 align:middle line:84%
they see people they've
known from this lifetime

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and every life time, and
they're all indicating

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:44.030 align:middle line:90%
the way to the light.

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:46.700 align:middle line:84%
None of them are jumping out
in a motorcycle with sidecar

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.550 align:middle line:90%
saying, hop in kiddo.

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:48.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll take you.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.360 align:middle line:84%
You still have to go
the last 10 yards.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.800 align:middle line:84%
What I believe, what I
really, truly believe

00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:01.610 align:middle line:84%
is that humanity has come before
us that is coming to where we

00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:06.010 align:middle line:84%
are today and is continuing on
and that we are being observed

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:07.890 align:middle line:90%
right now by the universe.

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.030 align:middle line:84%
They're simply making
their presence known

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:15.661 align:middle line:84%
to support us in making the last
10 yards into our next level

00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of evolution.
-That makes perfect sense.

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It makes absolute sense
because this, I believe,

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:23.010 align:middle line:90%
is the future of healing.

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:27.610 align:middle line:84%
This is here now, but this
is the integrative approach.

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:29.260 align:middle line:90%
This is self responsibility.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.260 align:middle line:90%
This is empowering healing.

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.380 align:middle line:84%
This is what I believe
is the future of healing.

00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't even like
the word healing.

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.910 align:middle line:84%
It makes it sound as if we have
to get better from something.

00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Truly, to me,
healing is evolution.

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Very well said.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.620 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way
to wrap this up too.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Healing is evolution.
-Ours.

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
