00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, and welcome.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The concept of
near-death experiences,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:84%
where someone goes
to the flashing light

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.207 align:middle line:84%
before their eyes, and they see
their life flash before them,

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and then they go down the
tunnel and they see the passed

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
loved ones-- that whole
classic definition

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:84%
was brought to us by my guest
today, Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moody is the
author of a book called

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.055 align:middle line:84%
"Life After Life,"
now in its 37th year.

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
It has sold millions of
copies because people

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
are really, truly curious
about the phenomenon

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:90%
of the near-death experience.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.035 align:middle line:84%
So welcome, and thank you so
much for joining me today.

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RAYMOND MOODY:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I just really appreciate
this invitation.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, absolutely.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
37 years ago, you
wrote this book.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
What was the inspiration
behind "Life After Life"?

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Basically, in
a word, it was Plato.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I was one of these
kids that-- I just

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
wasn't exposed to
religion when I was young.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'd become an amateur
astronomer at the age of seven

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and never had thought
about life after death.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
But in 1962, when I was a
first-year undergraduate

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
student at the
University of Virginia,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I decided to be a
philosophy major,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:90%
and reading Plato's "Republic".

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And Plato argues
very convincingly

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that this question
of life after death

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
question of human existence.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:90%
And I was persuaded by that.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.072 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He discussed that
hundreds and thousands of years

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:44.572 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: 2,300 years ago.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
"The Republic,"

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
there's this account
of a warrior named

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Er, who was believed
dead on the battlefield,

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
but during the funeral he
actually revived, and sat

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
up, and described going into
another world where he saw

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:84%
his life reviewed and
left his body and so on.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
impressed by that story,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.789 align:middle line:84%
as all philosophy students
are who read that.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And then three
years later in 1965,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I heard that Dr. George
Ritchie who at that time

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
was a professor of psychiatry
at the University of Virginia,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
had had such an experience
when he was a young man.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I took that opportunity
to find out and listen

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Ritchie's story.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately impressed
by Dr. Ritchie, who

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.137 align:middle line:84%
remains the finest
person I ever knew.

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, was he's speaking?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.928 align:middle line:84%
Or how did you find
out about his--

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Dr. Ritchie was very
accessible to the student

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:84%
groups around UVA,
and he often lectured.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And so just a short time
after I heard about his story,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I heard him tell it
and was very impressed.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And since that time, I've
had the wonderful opportunity

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and privilege of talking with
literally thousands of people

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world who've
been to the brink of death

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
but resuscitated and told
these very similar stories.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.464 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, have you yourself
had a near-death experience

00:03:09.464 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to be able to write about all
of this, or did you have one

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
after you started
writing about it all?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Actually my book
was published in 1975,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and then many years later
I came close to death

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
by an illness I had called
Hashimoto's disease, which

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:90%
went undiagnosed.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And in that process I did
come very close to death

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:90%
and had parts of this.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, not the really
classic, full-blown near-death

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
experience, but elements
of it, I definitely did.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you came up
with the characteristics

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
of a classic
near-death experience

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
through the thousands of
people that you've interviewed

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and spoken to and listened
to about their experience?

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yes, when "Life After
Life" was written in 1974

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and published the year
later, at that time

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.765 align:middle line:84%
I had interviewed
about a hundred

00:03:57.765 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and-- or knew about
150 cases of this

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.990 align:middle line:90%
that I'd been told of by people.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And then of those,
I had interviewed

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:90%
in depth 50 of them.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
came up with the list

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
of the characteristics,
which incidentally

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:90%
has held up very well, because--

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.646 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, phenomally, yes.

00:04:16.646 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --this has now been
researched by physicians

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
literally on every
continent except Antarctica.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But this a pattern that holds up
pretty much all over the world.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's where I connected.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I took a course from you at
the University of Philosophical

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Research when I as going
through my Masters.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And I learned about the
near-death experience

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
through the information
I learned in your course.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have been through this.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:90%
I had a near-death experience.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:90%
I had an incredible experience.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what I went through

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:90%
until I read it on the internet.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
didn't only happen to me?

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's-- first, for me,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity of
understanding what I went

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
through, and that it was
not just exclusive to me,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that there's a community of
people where this is also

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
an experience, and that
this was something.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've battled in
my mind for so long.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Was it psychosomatic?

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.641 align:middle line:90%
Was it physiological?

00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that the
consciousness goes through,

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:90%
that tunnel?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've addressed
those issues, but--

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I've
talked with thousands

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:90%
of people such as yourself.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And as a general
rule, what they tell

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.190 align:middle line:84%
me is that it was even more
real than ordinary waking

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.896 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:37.584 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: They say it's not--

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.083 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, hyperconsciousness.

>>MOODY: --dreamlike in any way.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's true.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely true.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I was in an accident,
and I had that experience

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:90%
of lifting up over the scene.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to see and hear
the thoughts and the feelings

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:84%
of all of the medics below
me-- this person, where they're

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
off purpose, and
this one who had

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.818 align:middle line:90%
a problem with relationships.

00:06:01.818 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I was able to hear
their mind chatter.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And at that same time, I was
completely consciously aware

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:84%
of everything that was going on
in my body, but I wasn't there.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've heard
this thousands of times.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.640 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
a clip of a movie

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.715 align:middle line:84%
that you were in--
it's a great movie.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:26.917 align:middle line:84%
And it was called "Through
the Tunnel and Beyond."

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to show this clip
so that people can kind of get

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:84%
an idea of what it is
that we're talking about.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.384 align:middle line:90%

In helping people

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
walk through the grief
process and knowing

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is life after
death is tremendously

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:90%
healing for them.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in my work, I've never
worked with a dying patient who

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
did not have an
apparitional experience.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:90%
It's 100%.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:90%
You can write this in stone.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.449 align:middle line:84%
If a person is terminally ill,
one that's close to death,

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have an
apparitional experience.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one thing that
we're doing in hospice,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.235 align:middle line:84%
if a person has had an
apparitional experience

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
or if they've had a
reunion, that person becomes

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.667 align:middle line:84%
top priority,
because we know death

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
is imminent, that it's always
within one week or two weeks

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:90%
that a person is going to die.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.047 align:middle line:90%
No matter.

00:07:13.047 --> 00:07:14.755 align:middle line:84%
If we think maybe
they've got six months,

00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
we're not real sure if hospice
even ought to take them in,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
but once a person has that
apparitional experience,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
if they have a
terminal illness, we

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
know that person is greeting
them, they're loving them,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.047 align:middle line:84%
and they're escalating
them to the other side.

00:07:29.047 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then people in
bereavement groups,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
there's a high number
who also have a reunion.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:90%
I was very familiar with this.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It was like a common,
everyday occurrence.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And hearing Dr. Moody
speak for the first time,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:90%
I was on the edge of my seat.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, how could he do this
under controlled circumstances?

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
It was just incredible to me the
thought that he could do that.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
62 people have been through
the oracle in Houston.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Out of the 62, 48 have had some
type of reunion experience.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And actually I call mine oracle,
because oracle means a place

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:90%
for acquiring wisdom.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And I have found that even
when a person comes and has

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
a session, even if they do not
have a reunion, something very

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.125 align:middle line:84%
profound, a deep psychological--
a deep psychic change

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.065 align:middle line:90%
takes place for them.

to go through things like that.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk in a
minute about those controlled

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
experiences and how
someone who maybe hasn't

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.384 align:middle line:84%
had a near-death experience
can recreate it, in a sense.

00:08:34.384 --> 00:08:36.425 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk a little
about the characteristics

00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that you so
wonderfully describe.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.370 align:middle line:84%
What is the first experience
that someone typically

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.879 align:middle line:84%
will tell you when they have
this near-death experience?

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Again,
generally what people

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
tell us is that when they're
at the brink of death

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and their heart stops beating,
for example, that they will

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
actually hear the doctor
say something like,

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, he's dead,
or whatever, which

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:84%
comes as a surprise to
them, because what people

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
tell me is that--
people say things like,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I have never felt
so alive as when

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.984 align:middle line:84%
I heard that doctor
say I was dead.

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But from their
point of view, they

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:90%
seem to leave their bodies.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
They watch the scene of the
resuscitation from above.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:84%
They can talk about
the conversations that

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.170 align:middle line:84%
went on among the
caretakers and so on,

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:84%
as you said, not
hearing an audible voice

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
but rather becoming aware of
the thoughts of the doctors

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.087 align:middle line:90%
and nurses and so on.

00:09:34.087 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, as a
psychiatrist though,

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is that a normal physiological
response to being unconscious?

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Well, no.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that
out-of-body experiences

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
are-- it's a vast
subject, but no.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
This is something outside of
the realm of psychopathology.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
This is not anything to
do with mental illness.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's an entirely
different category

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:90%
of altered consciousness.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, I thought
you as a scientist would

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.139 align:middle line:84%
know the differences,

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:90%
been curious about that myself.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, so someone has this
experience of rising above.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
You hear this time
after time after time.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And then what is
the next experience

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:90%
that classically follows that?

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Again, what we hear
from people universally,

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:84%
however articulate or well
educated or multilingual they

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
may be, they tell
us that they simply

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
have no words to describe
what happens next.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:84%
They say this is beyond our
ability to put it into words.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
But in trying to do
this, what they say

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is that they become aware
of a passageway or a tunnel.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And they go through this
tunnel, and they come out

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:84%
on the other side into
this incredibly brilliant

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and warm and comforting
and loving light.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be just
taken up in this light.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And in that light, they say that
relatives or friends of theirs

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.840 align:middle line:84%
who have already died
seem to be there almost

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:84%
in the role of a
greeting committee

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to help them through
this transition.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And they tell us
about panoramic memory

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
in which every
detail of their life

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:84%
is displayed around
them in this sort

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.566 align:middle line:84%
of full-color,
holographic, 3D panorama.

00:11:24.566 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like a life review?

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And they say that when you--
in this situation, when

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
you see each action
of your life,

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
it's like you're watching
another person when you see

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:84%
yourself do that, and that when
the action has its consequence,

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:84%
then you are embedded in the
consciousness of the person

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:90%
with whom you've interacted.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you see yourself doing
something mean to somebody,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:90%
then you feel the hurt.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you see yourself
doing something kind hearted,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
then you feel the good
feelings you brought about.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I felt complete expansiveness
of consciousness,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:84%
like the walls that
we're in, called

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
our body, are
basically limiting,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and what is beyond that is
limitless, is expansive.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And I somehow found myself with
Asia, that Asia came to me.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:90%
And that was the limitness.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:90%
That was the-- yeah.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Look, I'm trying to put it
into words, and I can't.

Yeah.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%

expansive consciousness.

They tell us that at this
point where their doctor says

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:84%
they are dead, that
they may actually

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
hear the physician
say, oh my, he's dead,

something like that.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.620 align:middle line:90%
they still feel very much alive.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, their consciousness
is heightened.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And they tell us that they seem
to leave their physical bodies.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
They say that they
float up, typically

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
right above the bed in the
operating room or the emergency

whether they were religious.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
To a certain extent, the
words that they bring to it

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:84%
have to-- are drawn the
best-- from their traditions,

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:84%
but this comes with the
proviso that they tell us

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:84%
that the words really
aren't adequate.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But one thing we

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:84%
the people who had no prior
religious understanding

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:84%
or belief prior to
this experience,

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
afterward they come back
and say, wow, it's real.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:90%
There is a God.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
There is life after
death, and so on.

to, as a general rule, again,

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:90%
to make them nondenominational.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
What people-- I hear
from people all the time

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
is they say, well,
you know, what

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I learned was that it
seems to me that all

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:84%
of the great religions are
looking at part of this,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
but that even then that it's
something that transcends even

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
what the religious
traditions tell us

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:90%
because it is indescribable.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:84%
People say that it's
beyond their ability

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:90%
to put it into words.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you
had your experience,

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:90%
did you see that light?

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.499 align:middle line:84%
Did you go through the
same euphoric experience?

00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, one thing
I should so say probably

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.589 align:middle line:84%
is that not everybody has
this whole full-blown picture.

00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm glad you said that.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.379 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And what it tends to
be is that if somebody has only

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
a momentary cardiac
arrest, for example,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
they're more likely to just tell
us one or two of these things,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:84%
like I got out of my body, I
saw the resuscitation going on,

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:90%
and then I came back to my body.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But if the cardiac
arrest, say, ling--

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:84%
goes on for several
minutes, then they're

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:84%
more likely to tell you more
of the story, like I got out

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
of my body and went through
this tunnel into the light,

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And in those cases
where the cardiac arrest

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
go on for extreme
lengths of time,

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
people will tell you this
whole full-blown picture

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of going into this light,
and seeing their life

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:84%
review, and other
things, as well.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to be partly
dependent on how close they

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:90%
got to death.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:84%
The closer you get to
death, the more involved

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.766 align:middle line:84%
and detailed and complex
this experience gets.

00:16:32.766 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How does
this help people

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:84%
who have people that
they know that have

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:90%
been through this experience?

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
How does it help
people deal with death?

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, first of
all, people that come back

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
from this experience say
they are not afraid of death,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and that-- because what they
learned from this experience,

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:84%
it convinces them totally that
what we call death is just

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:84%
a transition into another
dimension of existence.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that it's
a very nice existence.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard
that consistently?

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.244 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:17:08.244 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's very,
very peaceful.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes, yes.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:16.111 align:middle line:84%
And so they say that-- and
completely wrapped up in love

00:17:16.111 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:90%
is what you hear from people.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the
same time, they say

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that it's not that they
want to die anytime soon,

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
that they realize that life
is a learning experience,

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and that certainly it's a
bad move to take yourself out

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:84%
of it prematurely, but that
life has a purpose, too.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same
time, Lisa, there

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is this universal thing I
hear so often from people

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that there's always
a kind of nostalgia.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. George Ritchie,
the first person

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I-- living person I
ever heard this from,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
used to say that sometimes
he just got homesick

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
for that beautiful
place he had been,

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and that many times in
working with patients,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
for example, he felt
this presence of love

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that he had
encountered and so on.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So there's that homesickness,
too, and yet this willingness

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and commitment to go on in life
and to get things done here,

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.179 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely experienced that.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:84%
That's when I started my
radio show and everything.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:84%
But when people
come to you and they

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
explain their circumstances,
their experiences with this,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:90%
do you counsel them?

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to
them, and how do you

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.222 align:middle line:84%
give them guidance
to continue on?

00:18:41.222 --> 00:18:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, when
I first started

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.160 align:middle line:84%
doing this back in
the '60s, people

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
who had this experience
very often suspected

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:90%
they might be alone.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And many people
didn't want to talk about it.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And so it was
a great relief to them

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
to be able to talk
with somebody who

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:08.485 align:middle line:84%
was accepting and understood
and had heard this before.

00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:12.804 align:middle line:84%
And I think it does help people
to talk about their experience.

00:19:12.804 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: But far more,
I think, is the impact

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
that the experience has
on these two things.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Number one, that it
eliminates the fear of death.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, that whatever
they had been chasing before--

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's my experience,
both as a human being

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and as a psychiatrist,
is that everybody

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:90%
seems to be chasing something.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've spent my
life chasing knowledge.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Some people chase
fame or power or money

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%
or any of these other things.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a pursuit,
constant pursuit.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: But whatever
they were chasing,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.720 align:middle line:84%
they said when they come back
from this that it's-- what they

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.143 align:middle line:84%
realized that what this is
all about is to learn to love.

00:19:57.143 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And that even when
they-- Because

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:84%
if you think about this review,
then it becomes obvious.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Because they see
in this life review

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that if they've been
unkind to people, then

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
at the end of their life, that
they empathically experience

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
the hurt that they brought
about in other people's lives.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And if they've done
nice things, then they

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:90%
feel the good feelings.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:26.081 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA:I got to tell you
that I-- I-- I just--

00:20:26.081 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that is exactly
what happened to me.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking this moment
as just a-- I was broken up

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
with my boyfriend
at the time, and he

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
was the one who was
the first person

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.020 align:middle line:90%
at the scene of the accident.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:90%
It was a bike accident.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was that moment-- it
was after that that I realized

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
he was the man I was
supposed to marry.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.461 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:20:50.461 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And I married him, and
I'm still married to him.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:90%
But that is true.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.460 align:middle line:84%
It was-- the
relationship was-- it

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
was-- I was not good
in the relationship.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And I got that completely.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't intentional that I got
that, that I woke up and went,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:90%
oh, I was da--

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for saying that,
because that is absolutely

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:90%
what happened to me.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I got a full wake-up
call about-- and this

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.289 align:middle line:84%
was-- this is the
man I'm supposed

00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:90%
to be with the rest of my life.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had-- it wasn't
only that experience that

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.199 align:middle line:84%
made me realize that,
but now that you're

00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
saying this, that is
exactly what happened.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:90%
He helped me back to health.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:84%
He was the one who took
me to the hospital,

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.646 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
remember anything, my name.

00:21:27.646 --> 00:21:28.780 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't speak.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:90%
And he spoke for me.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.965 align:middle line:90%
And it was beautiful.

00:21:31.965 --> 00:21:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, how wonderful.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:84%
If you think about this
life review for a moment,

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.676 align:middle line:90%
this is a startling thing.

00:21:38.676 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's-- For the moment, let's
set aside all talk about life

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:84%
after death, and let's just ask
what we can draw as a minimal

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:90%
inference.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we don't-- we want
to draw the smallest inference

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:90%
that we can.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
We want to-- For the
moment, we'll just set aside

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
thinking about life after death,
and we'll think about this one

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.620 align:middle line:84%
thing that people,
in their life review,

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
see what they have done
to others and the feelings

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:90%
they brought about.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, just from that
one fact, we can draw,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I think quite confidently,
an amazing conclusion,

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:84%
which is that life is
a two-phase process.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Like at first, we
lead it forward,

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:90%
as the actor or protagonist.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the end of
death-- at the end of life,

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
it's like we switch around
and we watch the same action

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective of
the other characters.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Now that, to me, is startling.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Give me an
example of that.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:90%
I see what you're saying, but--

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, for example, if I
do something unkind to someone,

00:22:55.170 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
then when I die I'm
going to be that person.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:84%
When I review that
action, I won't see it

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:90%
through these eyes.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I will see it through
the heart of the person

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:90%
with whom I've interacted.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And what this really
does for you, I think,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
is it makes you
much more cautious.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I've tried for many
years to always keep

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that in my mind, that
whatever I'm doing or saying

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that someday I'm going
to have to look at this

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
from the other
person's perspective.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, I will also
be quite honest.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:90%
It works, but it works slowly.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.580 align:middle line:90%
It takes practice.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And you still find yourself
flying off the handle or saying

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:90%
things you wish you hadn't.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But I think when I look back on
my life for the last 40 years,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing it a greater
and greater percentage

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:90%
of the time at least.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:84%
But even people who've been
through this experience

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and who've, years ago, will
say that-- as Dr. George

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Ritchie said to me one time-- he
said, Raymond, this experience

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
makes your humanity even
more of a burden in a way.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And George was just a very
extremely kind-hearted

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.769 align:middle line:84%
And he wouldn't have
put it in the words

00:24:12.769 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
put it in, but I've

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
heard that same
sentiment expressed

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.160 align:middle line:90%
from so many other people.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what he meant,
and that is, let's face it.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to get
through the average day

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
without wanting to choke
at least one person.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the reality of life.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And what people say is in
this review of their life,

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
they see that what this
is all about is love,

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
but that it's still very
difficult on the daily--

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:84%
day-to-day routine, that
you find yourself flying off

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
the handle, but
that gradually, I

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
think by making
this a practice, you

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:90%
do get more conscious of it.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I will
assert that you don't

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:84%
need to even necessarily
have a near-death experience

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:90%
to get that lesson.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, that's
true, but definitely

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
a near-death
experience helps that.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It definitely
emphasizes it, yes.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest
that's a wonderful way

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:84%
to look at living
life is to understand

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.805 align:middle line:84%
that in the overall life review,
it is about consciousness,

00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:84%
it is about love, and it is
about ultimately taking care

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.104 align:middle line:90%
of other people.

00:25:20.104 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's--

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: It is.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.474 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just the-- being
aware of the feelings

00:25:24.474 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:90%
of other people.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Being aware of the feelings
of other people, really.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, let's get-- so
shared death experiences.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:84%
What are shared
death experiences?

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, a very
interesting fact is that all

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
of the phenomena
that we identify

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:84%
as the near-death experience,
including leaving the body,

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:84%
going toward this
light, seeing the light,

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.160 align:middle line:84%
seeing the apparitions
of the deceased

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and even the
panoramic life review,

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
occur frequently
not just to people

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
who almost die and return
but to the bystanders

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:90%
at the bedside of the dying.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:84%
That it's a very
frequent phenomenon

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that, as someone dies, that
the bystanders themselves

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:84%
will have these elements
that we identify

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:90%
as the near-death experience.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, they may
say that, as mother died,

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:84%
I myself felt that
I left my body

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and accompanied her
partway toward this light.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Or you hear a lot of people,
including-- I hear this a lot

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:84%
from doctors, that
as the patient died,

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:84%
they saw what seemed to be
a light leave from typically

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:84%
the upper part of
the body and rise up,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
or in some cases a transparent
replica of the person stand up

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:90%
and move away from the body.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And hearing music at the bedside
of the dying is very common,

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:84%
or how the light
permeates everything.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And the bystanders
may say that they

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:84%
see the spirits of
the deceased relatives

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and loved ones of the person
who's dying come into the room

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.310 align:middle line:90%
as to escort them away.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And most incredibly,
and I have many cases

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:84%
of interviewed over the
years of people who tell me

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that, as their loved one died,
they empathically co-lived

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
the life review of the
person who passed away.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Now, what the
shared death experiences mean

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:31.110 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the typical
way that this is debated

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
is that-- well, I'm
sure that everybody's

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
heard that when the
discussion turns

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
to near-death experiences,
some people take it seriously.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Other people say,
well, this is just

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.470 align:middle line:84%
the cutoff of the oxygen
flow to the brain,

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.130 align:middle line:84%
creates this
hallucinatory phenomenon

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that gets reported as the
near-death experience.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:84%
But that fails to account for
why the bystanders would have

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
the same experience, because
the oxygen flow to their brain

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.915 align:middle line:84%
is not compromised and yet
they have the same experience.

00:28:01.915 --> 00:28:04.507 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you've heard this
over and over and over again?

00:28:04.507 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Initially from one of my own
medical professors back in 1972

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
who had such an
experience when she

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:84%
was trying to resuscitate her
own mother who passed away.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And when her mother did
pass away, the physician

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:84%
herself left her body and
went partway toward this light

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:90%
with her mother who was dying.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Your experiences

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So this took you on a
journey to various locations

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:90%
around our world.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:39.180 align:middle line:90%
We have a clip of a place.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.428 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, yes.

00:28:42.428 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, incredible as it may
seem, the factual reality,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
which you can learn
from standard textbooks

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Greek
philosophy, for example,

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.320 align:middle line:84%
is that the ancient
Greek philosophers,

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
who are the foundation stones
of all Western civilization--

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:90%
that's where it began.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But these individuals, many
of them during their lifetimes

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:84%
were thought to
have been related

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:14.950 align:middle line:84%
to this technique of calling
up the spirits of the deceased.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.955 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient Greeks
had institutions

00:29:17.955 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
where they-- which they
called Oracles of the Dead,

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
where they practiced various
procedures to be able to bring

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:84%
people into a state of
consciousness during which they

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.160 align:middle line:84%
would have visionary reunions
with their departed loved ones.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was interested
in this in college,

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:84%
but back in the 1980s I read
the archaeological reports

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:84%
where one of these sites
had been uncovered.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And based on what the
archaeologists found,

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I was able to figure
out how they did it.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I set it
up, and it works.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.310 align:middle line:90%
And now I-- It works.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you might
say, well, sure,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.350 align:middle line:90%
it works for Raymond Moody.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:84%
No, it works for anybody
who wants to set it up.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And numerous other psychologists
and so on around the world

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:84%
have set up this procedure and
apparatus that I figured out.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And it really does work.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You can take people through
a procedure during which,

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:84%
in a full state of
waking awareness,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.600 align:middle line:84%
they seem to see and
converse with the spirits

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.094 align:middle line:90%
of their departed loved ones.

00:30:29.094 --> 00:30:31.260 align:middle line:84%

journey that they go through,

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's based on
what you found.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to show people the
clip of where you were.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
the place in Greece,

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
which is the origin of
the Oracle of the Dead.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.546 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:30:43.546 --> 00:30:44.450 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY (VOICEOVER): Dr.
Dakaris in his search

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:84%
for this site surmised that,
in fact, the Oracle was

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
in the northwest corner
of Greece in Epirus.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Homer talks about the Oracle
being located at a point

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
where two rivers flow together
to form the Acheron River

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and that there was
a pinnacle of rock.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:16.375 align:middle line:84%
All Dr. Dakaris did was to trust
Homer and to go to the location

00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that he believed Homer
was talking about,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:84%
excavate it, and indeed did find
this subterranean complex there

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:84%
exactly at the location where he
surmised Homer had located it.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.990 align:middle line:84%
The institution
was subterranean.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:41.460 align:middle line:84%
This was another factor in why
it was so long undiscovered.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Even in its heyday in antiquity,
it was entirely underground.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
In approximately
160 BC, the Romans

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:90%
burned the Oracle of the Dead.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, this dropped
out of Western civilization

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.460 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Then subsequently in about
350 AD, the church banned it.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They made it anathema
for a Christian

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
to believe that a spirit
can be seen in the mirror.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And so for that reason, we have
had no continuing tradition

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:84%
of evocation of the deceased
in Western civilization.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you went to this
location with the idea in mind

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
replicate this concept

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.060 align:middle line:90%
of the Oracle of the Dead?

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:90%
And so you explored it.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yes, and you don't
really need much equipment.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.040 align:middle line:84%
This worked by
creating what we called

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.480 align:middle line:84%
an optical clear depth, where
you can take a polished silver

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:84%
bowl, for example, fill it
with water and olive oil.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And you gaze into it, and
that gives you a depth.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:84%
You don't see any
reflections, but just

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
like you're gazing
away into eternity.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And under that
circumstance, many people

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.380 align:middle line:84%
will have what we call eidetic
imagery, which is full-color,

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:08.020 align:middle line:84%
moving, three-dimensional,
brightly colored visions

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of which you don't seem to have
any conscious control over.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.020 align:middle line:90%
They unfold of their own accord.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I just set this up
in my research facility

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and just took a big wall
mirror and surrounded it

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:84%
in a darkened area
with black cloth

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.100 align:middle line:84%
so that you exclude reflections,
got a comfortable easy chair

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:84%
in front of it, and you take
people through a procedure.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You ask them to choose
some one person who's

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:84%
died that they
want to see again.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And then just as I would
as a grief counselor,

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I get them to talk
about the person,

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.790 align:middle line:84%
to bring up all their
memories and to talk

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:84%
about the good points
of the relationship,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.370 align:middle line:84%
the sticking points
of the relationship.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:90%
This lasts an hour or two.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Then you let them sit
in this little chamber

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and leave them in there
for about an hour,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.745 align:middle line:84%
and tell them just
to get relaxed

00:34:02.745 --> 00:34:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and to gaze into the mirror.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And under those circumstances,
many people actually

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:13.790 align:middle line:84%
do see full-color, very
lifelike apparitions

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:90%
of their departed loved ones.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.020 align:middle line:84%
About 30% of them tell
us that they absolutely

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:84%
hear the audible
voice of the deceased.

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Almost all the rest
of them talk about

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:84%
a mind-to-mind or heart-to-heart
communication, a vivid sense

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.383 align:middle line:90%
of the presence of the deceased.

00:34:33.383 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:90%


00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this a healing
experience for people?

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, yeah.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.469 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this does
seem to really help

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:90%
people move on in their grief.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing
I hear from people

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.880 align:middle line:84%
all the time is that, if I
only had five more minutes.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're able to provide.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.880 align:middle line:90%
This does work.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is not Raymond
Moody talking, but--

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've done this
under scientific studies.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I've done
it under very controlled

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.270 align:middle line:90%
circumstances.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:19.135 align:middle line:84%
And this is now taught at
a institute in California,

00:35:19.135 --> 00:35:21.550 align:middle line:84%
a psychotherapy
training institute.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:25.272 align:middle line:84%
It's incorporated into
the curriculum there.

00:35:25.272 --> 00:35:26.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:35:26.105 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, We're going to show
some pictures of that.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But it was all based
on your experiences

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.015 align:middle line:84%
of where you went to the
Oracle of the Dead to see.

00:35:34.015 --> 00:35:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at that,
because it shows the ruins.

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they did in the
ancient Greek culture, right?

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Oh, yes, this
was part and parcel

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Greek
culture, and many

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.230 align:middle line:84%
of the great classical
writers of antiquity

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:48.490 align:middle line:90%
talk about this place.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So it was a standard
institution in ancient Greece.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you had to go.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.704 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at it.

00:35:56.704 --> 00:35:58.267 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:58.267 --> 00:35:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY (VOICEOVER):
We're here at one

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:05.150 align:middle line:84%
of the most amazing places in
the world-- to me, at least.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:08.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the Oracle
of the Dead at Ephyra

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.160 align:middle line:84%
where, in ancient
times, people would

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:84%
come to actually see and
visit with the spirits

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.600 align:middle line:90%
of their departed loved ones.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Until recent times,
scholars have

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.750 align:middle line:84%
assumed that what
was going on here

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:25.040 align:middle line:84%
was simple fraud, in the sense
that we in the 20th century

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:84%
West presumably know that such
things that were described here

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:90%
by the ancient writers can't be.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But in light of
recent developments

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and research that's
been done now

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.060 align:middle line:84%
by many psychologists
replicating

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:84%
the experience of seeing
apparitions of the departed,

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:84%
we can now have a
plausible explanation

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:84%
for what was going on in this
rather amazing sanctuary.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And now we come through this
entranceway of enormous stones

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:02.790 align:middle line:84%
into a courtyard,
which is laid out

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.890 align:middle line:84%
to give the impression
that one is in a cave

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.560 align:middle line:90%
or in an underground world.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.480 align:middle line:84%
One has to imagine that in
antiquity this was roofed over

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.580 align:middle line:84%
so that we literally
felt as though we

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:90%
were in the underworld.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:84%
At this point,
the pilgrims would

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:84%
have been met by the
psychagogues, the guides who

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.900 align:middle line:84%
lived here to
conduct the pilgrims

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:84%
though the experience of
visiting with their deceased.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.400 align:middle line:84%
As we go in a little bit
into the more functioning

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:45.400 align:middle line:84%
part of the Oracle proper, we
find immediately in front of us

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.490 align:middle line:90%
here a wall.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:51.390 align:middle line:84%
The right part of the wall
was a medieval addition.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:84%
The Byzantine church built a
chapel here in medieval times

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:03.310 align:middle line:84%
on the ruins of
the ancient Oracle.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they did
this 2,300 years ago.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:11.220 align:middle line:84%
It shows that people have
been so curious about life

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:16.880 align:middle line:84%
beyond life, or this passing
experience, for so long.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.590 align:middle line:84%
What exactly did
they use that for?

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.710 align:middle line:90%
What was that for?

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Basically, when
you read the accounts that

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.100 align:middle line:84%
have survived from
antiquity of people

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.850 align:middle line:84%
who visited this
Oracle of the Dead,

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.830 align:middle line:84%
you can pretty much
tell that basically

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.420 align:middle line:90%
what it was was grief.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.610 align:middle line:84%
This was a way that
they had if they

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.720 align:middle line:84%
had some issue with the
person who had passed away

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.380 align:middle line:90%
that they couldn't get beyond.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:84%
They would go to these places
and go through this procedure,

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.630 align:middle line:84%
during which they could
actually see and converse

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:90%
with the person and clear it up.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
same reason people

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.757 align:middle line:90%
have come to me at my place.

00:38:55.757 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%

And it is very,
very challenging.

00:39:02.447 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.400 align:middle line:84%
The Oracle of the Dead-- one of
the Greek Oracles of the Dead

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.150 align:middle line:84%
has been there at
least since 1075 BC.

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.425 align:middle line:90%
So that was 3,000 years ago.

00:39:17.425 --> 00:39:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And so this was
probably-- it's really

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.110 align:middle line:84%
not just an ancient
Greece-- Greek thing,

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.610 align:middle line:84%
this was-- Pretty much all over
the world people had discovered

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:90%
this, even in prehistoric times.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As a psychiatrist,
do you really

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:38.040 align:middle line:84%
think that there is such a
thing as getting over grief?

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: No, but even
more so as a human being,

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
any such thing.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.290 align:middle line:90%


00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.630 align:middle line:84%
To some degree,
yes, especially when

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.140 align:middle line:84%
the passing is in
the proper order.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.820 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
some things that

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.260 align:middle line:90%
do seem to me irreconcilable.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is, for example,
the loss of a child

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:07.100 align:middle line:84%
is always just very--
it's a very wrenching kind

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.160 align:middle line:90%
of experience.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.337 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Unexplainable.

00:40:09.337 --> 00:40:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you know, I got
to go on and say here

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that the people who come to
me for counseling about grief

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.670 align:middle line:84%
are people who are
having trouble.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't necessarily say
from that that everybody fits

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
in that category, but
at least the people

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I deal with, grief
is always-- you

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:39.410 align:middle line:90%
never quite get over something.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I lost my first child
in June of 1970.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.570 align:middle line:90%
He was 36 hours old.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And in that era, people
didn't talk about such things.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:84%
A kind of wall of
silence came down.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's only
retrospectively that I

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:05.090 align:middle line:84%
can see it never
really quite gets over.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:05.819 align:middle line:90%
No it doesn't.

00:41:05.819 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It doesn't.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And after all of your

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:84%
through the

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.720 align:middle line:84%
have you been through that
yourself with the psychomanteum

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences
with the mirror?

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Have you done all that yourself?

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: I did.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to see my
cookie-baking grandma,

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.720 align:middle line:90%
as I call her.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.641 align:middle line:90%

00:41:30.556 --> 00:41:33.940 align:middle line:84%
haven't with my child,

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.200 align:middle line:90%
maybe how tender this is.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:84%
But no, I haven't
tried with my child.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I asked you that
just because it really-- I

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:44.040 align:middle line:84%
love how you answered
that question,

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.170 align:middle line:84%
as a psychiatrist
and as a human.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.510 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the most
challenging things

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:52.474 align:middle line:84%
to overcome that yet you
really don't ever overcome.

00:41:52.474 --> 00:41:54.140 align:middle line:84%
People have been
trying to figure it out

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.670 align:middle line:84%
for thousands and
thousands of years.

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: The way
I look at it is--

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.330 align:middle line:84%
grief is-- if you think
of yourself as this,

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:84%
like all your
consciousness is in here,

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.120 align:middle line:84%
then when you have a
loss of that nature

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.800 align:middle line:84%
then it fills up your
whole self with this grief.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you here
in the 21st century

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:20.000 align:middle line:90%
that I could go right back to--

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:84%
If you ask me what
that grief is like,

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it's the same,
but that now the difference

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.400 align:middle line:90%
is this is me.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Grief, paradoxically
by working with it,

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:39.410 align:middle line:84%
you can expand yourself
so that it occupies maybe

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:44.720 align:middle line:84%
a lesser percentage of your
whole total conscious being.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But the grief in
itself, in my opinion,

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:90%
just pretty much is the same.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, yet you've
created a life pursuit

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.470 align:middle line:84%
of helping people get
through it by creating

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:01.050 align:middle line:84%
this entire experience, which
we're going to take a look at,

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:84%
the psychomanteum
and what that looks

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:90%
like in a clip in just a minute.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But your whole mission,
purpose, passion

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:12.920 align:middle line:84%
is to enable people
to connect with what

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.650 align:middle line:90%
the afterlife could possibly be.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And does this indeed
ease people who

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.760 align:middle line:84%
have lost loved ones,
in your experience?

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.395 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: No question about it.

00:43:22.395 --> 00:43:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I think it's
been demonstrated

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in numerous studies
actually, as I understand,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that just reading about
near-death experiences

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.580 align:middle line:84%
or hearing someone
talk about them

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.050 align:middle line:84%
brings comfort to
people who are grieving.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have heard of
studies of that nature,

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.010 align:middle line:84%
but I'm saying that from
my own personal experience

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:52.360 align:middle line:84%
because I just hear from
people all the time,

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.820 align:middle line:84%
from the very beginning I began
to lecture on this in 1969

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and 1970, that I
heard people say

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that just hearing
about these experiences

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:07.859 align:middle line:84%
gives them some sort of comfort
in dealing with their losses.

00:44:07.859 --> 00:44:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.310 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're
going to take a look

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:14.170 align:middle line:84%
at what these experiences are
where Dr. Moody takes people

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:15.900 align:middle line:90%
into the chamber and the mirror.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
psychomanteum experience.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take a look at
that when we come back.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.460 align:middle line:90%
This is Lisa Garr.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.130 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.460 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Dr. Raymond
Moody, and we're

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:84%
talking about, God, so many
great things-- life after life.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.300 align:middle line:84%
What we were talking about
before the break were

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.270 align:middle line:84%
these controlled experiences,
these controlled circumstances,

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that you take people through
called a psychomanteum.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.660 align:middle line:90%
What does that word mean?

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, it
basically means

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:47.247 align:middle line:84%
a place where you go to
converse with the deceased.

00:44:47.247 --> 00:44:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course it does.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.560 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:84%
This isn't normal breakfast
table conversation.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So a place that you go to
converse with the deceased.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And you created this
out of a need for people

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.010 align:middle line:90%
to heal from grief, yes?

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Oh, Lisa, that is
a wonderful thing to say.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.460 align:middle line:84%
That makes me seem
like a nice guy,

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.650 align:middle line:84%
but I'll just be
completely honest.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: The reason I
was interested in this

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.670 align:middle line:84%
initially was that
this was really

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:21.940 align:middle line:84%
a very important
institution in the creation

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.910 align:middle line:84%
of the entire Western
way of thinking.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And see, I was a
professor of logic.

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:27.730 align:middle line:90%
I love logic.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And wild as it may seem--

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:30.594 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I'm not going to
talk about this in detail,

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.170 align:middle line:84%
but the Western logic came
from these Oracles of the Dead.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.232 align:middle line:84%
It's a long story, but
that's how it got started.

00:45:39.232 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: An interesting
one, though.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Give me the two minute on that.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, basically
the philosopher Parmenides,

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.110 align:middle line:90%
who was the person who--

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I remember studying
this in your course.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: In 500 BC,
Parmenides, who's

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:57.270 align:middle line:84%
regarded as the father
of deductive logic, first

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.950 align:middle line:84%
was able to articulate
the notion of truth.

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:84%
That is, that some things
are the case independently

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.210 align:middle line:90%
of what anybody thinks about it.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was too abstract
an idea for people

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.360 align:middle line:84%
in a preliterate culture
to grasp for reasons

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:90%
I won't go into.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But they were trying
to solve the problem,

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and it was Parmenides
who did it.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And Parmenides in his
day job, as it were,

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:24.030 align:middle line:84%
was a worker at one of
these Oracles of the Dead.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And he would get
in a cave, and he

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:84%
was known as an
iatromantis-- or prophet

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.630 align:middle line:84%
doctor is more or
less the translation.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But he would go through--
he would lie in the cave,

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:84%
presumably lie
stock still, and he

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:47.370 align:middle line:84%
would have these visionary
voyages into the other world.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And on one of his
trips over there,

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:54.440 align:middle line:84%
he met this goddess who divulged
the first written-out logical

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.110 align:middle line:90%
deduction in the form of a song.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And this was-- in
effect, you could

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:84%
say histories of Western
thought make a dividing line

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.570 align:middle line:84%
at Parmenides, because
things after Parmenides-- it

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:12.790 align:middle line:84%
was a totally different world
after he discovered this.

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And he, from his
point of view anyway,

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.280 align:middle line:84%

information that was

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:24.400 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of Western
logic back from the other side.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I got
interested in it.

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
started doing it,

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the people
that I was taking through it

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:40.030 align:middle line:84%
were-- felt like they had
benefited in their grief

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:43.250 align:middle line:84%
or moved on in their grief,
and it helped them and so on.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So that was a great-- that
was a great side effect.

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:49.440 align:middle line:84%

then I realized-- well,

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't
anticipate it, but I

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.250 align:middle line:84%
saw that people who
went through this

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:01.411 align:middle line:84%
actually did gain
relief from their grief.

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:02.910 align:middle line:84%

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.100 align:middle line:84%

00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.445 align:middle line:84%
a look at what
we're talking about.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:17.380 align:middle line:84%

direct his lifelong research

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:22.080 align:middle line:84%
into the nature of death
yet one step further.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: It's well
known that people

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:29.360 align:middle line:84%
on their deathbeds, dying people
who do go on to die, very often

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.360 align:middle line:84%
just prior to their death will
say something like, oh, why,

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.805 align:middle line:84%
there's mother, or there's
grandpa, or whatever.

00:48:36.805 --> 00:48:40.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it seems
that at the moment of death

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:43.960 align:middle line:84%
they see apparitions of
departed relatives and friends

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:47.440 align:middle line:84%
who seem to be there,
as it were, to meet them

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.700 align:middle line:84%
or to help them through
this transition.

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:55.180 align:middle line:84%
From time to time, physicians,
nurses, other people

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:58.050 align:middle line:84%
at the bedside of
dying patients will

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:01.340 align:middle line:84%
say that they have an
experience in which they

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:06.350 align:middle line:84%
seem to see the person leave
the body at the moment of death.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Also, I've talk with a number
of physicians and nurses

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and also friends of
people who have died,

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.590 align:middle line:84%
relatives of people
who've died, who tell me

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that they have undergone
what I can only

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.660 align:middle line:84%
call empathetic
near-death experiences.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:26.270 align:middle line:84%
These are experiences in which,
for instance, the physician

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:30.050 align:middle line:84%
who's resuscitating someone
who's very close to them

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.710 align:middle line:84%
will say that, as this
person dies and begins

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:35.510 align:middle line:84%
to slip into this experience
of seeing the tunnel

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and going out of
the body and so on,

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that the physician himself
or herself will begin

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:84%
to experience
this, will actually

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.520 align:middle line:84%
enter into the near-death

that those people that

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:52.740 align:middle line:84%
had the experiences,
the shared death

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.400 align:middle line:84%
experiences, that they
have to-- that they're

related to that

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:01.060 align:middle line:84%
that they're within
their realm of relations?

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean by that?

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Oh, well,
actually, Lisa, no.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
because I hear the same thing

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:15.600 align:middle line:84%
from doctors who were just
called in to see a patient.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:21.360 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know who it was, and
they were on call or whatever.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
resuscitate a stranger,

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and maybe the
person died during.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But they say that they see this
light leave the body and so on.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So apparently, in
the general case,

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:37.210 align:middle line:84%
yes, usually it's the
people at the bedside

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.630 align:middle line:84%
or loved ones and
friends and so on,

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:42.700 align:middle line:84%
but I've had plenty of cases,
too, of physicians who just

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.490 align:middle line:84%
called in to see a
perfect stranger who

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:48.660 align:middle line:84%
was in the process of
dying and saw this light

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.520 align:middle line:84%
or saw the person leave
their bodies and so on.

begs the question,

parallel universes,

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and multidimensional realities,
and different dimensions.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:07.880 align:middle line:84%

of, do those dimensions exist?

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any evidence of
those dimensions existing

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:14.850 align:middle line:90%
in your experience?

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Quite a number,
in absolute terms

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.070 align:middle line:84%
but not in percentage terms,
of the people with a near-death

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:26.470 align:middle line:84%
experience-- a small
percentage of them,

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and variably these
are people who

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.980 align:middle line:84%
had extremely lengthy
cardiac arrests that

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:35.050 align:middle line:84%
went far beyond that-- we all
hear the five-minute rule,

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that beyond five minutes
you can't resuscitate

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:39.610 align:middle line:90%
because the brain is damaged.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And as a rule of
thumb, that's terrific,

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.820 align:middle line:84%
but in many cases also there's
just-- it doesn't work out.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have cases
of people who had

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:51.450 align:middle line:84%
extremely lengthy
cardiac arrests and yet

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:55.280 align:middle line:90%

that's less than 1%,

but I've spoken to several.

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And so these people
with the extremely lengthy

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.260 align:middle line:84%
cardiac arrests will
say, yes, that they

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:12.890 align:middle line:84%
see that there are different
levels or dimensions.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard people
say, for example,

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:19.580 align:middle line:84%
that they see into one
dimension that is entirely,

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:23.290 align:middle line:84%
in effect, an institution of
higher learning, that people

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:25.920 align:middle line:84%
are there pursuing
knowledge and truth.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And that other people--
these people say also

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.140 align:middle line:84%
they see another dimension of
reality, which is described,

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.200 align:middle line:84%
or people try to
put it into words

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.680 align:middle line:90%
by saying, cities of light.

at the corpse lying in the bed

the presence of the son of God.

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Out of that light stepped the
most amazing being I have ever

been in the presence of, the
most powerfully built male

I have ever seen.

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, once being in the
presence of the being who

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:40.954 align:middle line:84%
knows everything about you, to

>>MOODY: Oh yeah, George Ritchie
was the finest human being

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:54.552 align:middle line:84%
I ever knew in my

00:55:54.552 --> 00:55:56.510 align:middle line:84%

was an amazing person.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, he was.

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:57.890 align:middle line:90%
He was just incredible.

00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why did he
impact you so much?

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well-- Well,
you know, George-- I

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:04.770 align:middle line:84%
lived in the same community
George Ritchie did

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.950 align:middle line:84%
for some time, and
you get to know people

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:09.140 align:middle line:84%
like that because of
the things that you

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:12.110 align:middle line:84%
hear about other people
telling you about.

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And he was just so completely
kind and loving and yet

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.990 align:middle line:90%
just totally human, too.

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard his
experience in 1965,

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I was an undergraduate
at UVA, and I

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:30.680 align:middle line:84%
knew that something
had happened to me when

00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I heard that experience,
which has played out

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:34.890 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of my life.

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out,
actually-- this

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:44.780 align:middle line:84%
isn't-- my-- George's experience
took place at Camp Barkeley,

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Texas in December 1943 when he
was a recruit into the Army.

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And hearing the story in 1965
so profoundly influenced me.

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Then I went on this
quest of interviewing

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.430 align:middle line:90%
all these other people.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And the book was published
in November of '75.

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And just before I published
it, I called Dr. Ritchie

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and asked if I could
dedicate the book to him.

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So that was the only contact
in those intervening 10 years.

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, flash forward
to March of '76.

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about this with
my father, who by then had heard

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.900 align:middle line:84%
a tape of Dr.
Ritchie's experience.

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you exactly
what Dr.-- my father said.

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:38.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, huh, that's
really interesting.

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:44.770 align:middle line:84%
George Ritchie, Camp Barkeley,
Texas, December 1943.

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:49.500 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, I was
there and so were you.

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.960 align:middle line:84%
My mom and dad are from
Porterdale, Georgia.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.860 align:middle line:84%
George is from
Richmond, Virginia.

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But my dad went
to Camp Barkeley,

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Texas in early
September 1943 so he

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.920 align:middle line:84%
could go to officers
candidate school.

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I was conceived in
late September 1943.

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness, wow.

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: George's experience
was December 24, 1943.

00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And Mom and Dad moved away from
Camp Barkeley in December 29,

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:22.680 align:middle line:90%
1943.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.760 align:middle line:90%
So I was there in utero--

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In spirit.

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --when
this experience took

00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:28.940 align:middle line:90%
place that changed my life.

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:32.306 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know about
it until "Life After Life"

00:58:32.306 --> 00:58:33.430 align:middle line:90%
had already been published.

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many times
do you see people

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:42.935 align:middle line:84%
in groups communicating with
each other in the afterlife?

00:58:42.935 --> 00:58:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Now, that's
interesting, Lisa.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.990 align:middle line:90%


00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Nothing really comes to mind,
except occasionally I've

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:56.790 align:middle line:84%
had cases of
near-death experiences

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:59.540 align:middle line:84%
where two people
at once came close

00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to death in the course
of an accident and so on.

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, subsequently, even
when they were still separated,

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:10.860 align:middle line:84%
talked about, yeah, I saw--
and they had this communication

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.030 align:middle line:84%
even when they were
out of their bodies.

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.580 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between life

00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.330 align:middle line:90%
after life and reincarnation?

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, you know, out
of the thousands of people

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that I've talked with who
had near-death experiences,

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.030 align:middle line:84%
there were only
three of them that

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:30.950 align:middle line:84%
had some experience within
the near-death experience that

00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:34.430 align:middle line:84%
led them to think that
there's a reincarnation.

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:39.420 align:middle line:84%
But the great majority of the
others who didn't see anything

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:42.040 align:middle line:84%
related to reincarnation,
nonetheless

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.350 align:middle line:84%
it seems to wake them up at
least to the possibility.

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:48.350 align:middle line:84%
People will say things like,
I didn't really say anything

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.120 align:middle line:84%
over there than indicated to
me that there's reincarnation,

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.380 align:middle line:84%
because I only went to a
certain point and came back,

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:58.100 align:middle line:84%
but they seem to
be emotionally more

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.047 align:middle line:84%
accepting of that possibility
after a near-death experience.

01:00:02.047 --> 01:00:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there a
theme in the people

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:06.170 align:middle line:84%
that you've interviewed
as to why they come back?

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Do they come back to a-- because
of a calling of a loved one

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.060 align:middle line:84%
that's calling them
back or a mission?

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Or have you noticed a through
line with these people?

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Sometimes people, when
they're over there, are told,

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:21.080 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go back,
you've got things left to do.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But they're not told what that
is that they're supposed to do,

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:26.950 align:middle line:84%
which can be very
frustrating for them.

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:29.870 align:middle line:90%


01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, having known some
of these people for decades,

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I see that in the passage of
time, they sort of wake up

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh, that's
why I had to come back.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Then other people just don't
know why they were sent back.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And some people
are given a choice.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
They're told that
they can either

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
go on with the experience
they're having or go back

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.820 align:middle line:90%
to the life they were leading.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And not too surprisingly,
all of those

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
that were given that
choice that I interviewed

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:00.160 align:middle line:90%
chose to come back.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting in
this, they almost always

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.960 align:middle line:90%
give the same reason.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is that, for
themselves, they would rather

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
have stayed in that
light, but they

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.960 align:middle line:84%
chose to come back
because they had

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.730 align:middle line:90%
young children left to raise.

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:16.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the most common
thing people say.

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Or they say that, I spent my
life preparing for a helping

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:24.776 align:middle line:84%
profession and I chose to
come back to complete that.

01:01:24.776 --> 01:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I imagine
that this could

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
be very healing for
children who are now

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:31.380 align:middle line:84%
adults who have lost
parents when they

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
were young, or at
any age really,

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
to be able to know that
that parent went to a place,

01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:43.625 align:middle line:84%
that the transition
was a good place.

01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:44.900 align:middle line:90%
At least this could be--

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And then we always got
to think that-- even

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
people with near-death
experiences tell me that when--

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
after they come back from
this and they lose a loved

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.165 align:middle line:90%
one, that they still grieve.

01:01:58.165 --> 01:01:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, of course.

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Because-- and what
it really does, I think,

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
is to put the locus
of the grieving more--

01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:06.800 align:middle line:90%
it makes it more obvious.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Because people with
near-death experiences

01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
say that when they lose a
loved one that they realize,

01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
of course, my loved one
is OK, but I miss them,

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.430 align:middle line:90%
is the thing that they get.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Losing a parent is a very
difficult thing for a child.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And recent studies
indicate that 20

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the line
there that, if you lose

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
a parent before you're
age 20, that it's

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.810 align:middle line:84%
very difficult for
people to reconcile.

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to stay around

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:44.130 align:middle line:90%

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%

01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:51.150 align:middle line:84%
had been sort of taken
up in this doctrine

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is a
secondary byproduct of brain

01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
process and has no
independent reality.

01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
That's just what he had always
assumed from his profession.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And in November of 2008, Eben
developed a horrific condition

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:16.080 align:middle line:84%
called E. coli meningitis, which
is unheard of among adults.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.750 align:middle line:84%
It's occasionally with
infants, but almost

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.210 align:middle line:90%
unheard of of adults.

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And in those few cases where
it happens with adults,

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
it's virtually unsurvivable,
and those who do survive

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:29.310 align:middle line:90%
are impaired.

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:31.190 align:middle line:90%
So that was the situation.

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So in November of 2008,
he developed this illness.

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
His colleagues, no doubt
concerned about him.

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
He was carefully monitored
throughout this illness.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.420 align:middle line:90%
He went into a week-long coma.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And the distribution
of the lesions

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
absolutely preclude that he
could have been conscious

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
by the standard
neurophysiological theories

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.100 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But when he woke up,
he talked about going

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
into this other world, and
just an incredible story

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.960 align:middle line:90%
of a journey into another world.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And throughout this, he
kept seeing this young woman

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't know who she
was, but she was at a distance

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and not making direct contact.

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But he kept seeing
this young woman.

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, after he recovered from
this illness with no seqhela,

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.120 align:middle line:90%
he's just vibrant.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And so he started being
curious about his--

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:32.820 align:middle line:84%
he had known that he was
adopted at age four months,

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and adopted by a neurosurgeon in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina,

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.150 align:middle line:90%
where Eben grew up.

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And so he knew that he had
been adopted at four months,

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and what he had been
told or understood

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
about his birth parents was
that they were high school

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
sweethearts and that
after he was born

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.430 align:middle line:90%
they went their separate ways.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So then he got curious when he
came back from his experience

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
as to what-- you know, about
his biological birth situation.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So he did some inquiring,
and he found out

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
that this woman who
worked at the institution

01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:14.550 align:middle line:84%
where he was born was willing
to give him some information.

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And he found out that his birth
parents had subsequently gotten

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
married and had
several children.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So he went and made
the reunion with them,

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and when he did--
he found them--

01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:32.060 align:middle line:84%
they were in mourning because
of the loss of their daughter.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when Eben saw the
photograph of this daughter,

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
it was the young girl he
had seen in this vision.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, that's
a chilling story.

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: This is coming out
soon, I think, in a book.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And this, I think,
is very difficult

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.570 align:middle line:90%
to explain in prosaic terms.

01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
I think we're getting closer and
closer to the situation where

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
we're just going to have
to breathe a deep sigh

01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and say, my god, there
is life after death.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
you're here for.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
your new book, "Paranormal."

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, "The
Paranormal" is my memoirs.

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of suggestion came
from my co-writer Paul Perry.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And I never thought
my life would

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.520 align:middle line:90%
be particularly interesting.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.530 align:middle line:90%

>>MOODY: But my wonderful
friend, Paul Perry,

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.830 align:middle line:84%
who's just a superb journalist
plus a really nice guy--

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and he-- I've known
Paul since 1988.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so he-- I sort of
told my life story to him,

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and then he's put it
together in this book.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the quest
I've made in my life

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand
this mystery of what

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:48.382 align:middle line:90%
happens to us when we die.

01:07:48.382 --> 01:07:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there
was also a movie that

01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
was made about this experience
of the near-death experience

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:53.830 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip of
the movie coming up

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:59.630 align:middle line:84%
that kind of encapsulates what
people experience when they

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
go through a
near-death experience.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at that.

What do you think is the overall
thing that people take away

from an experience
like nearly dying?

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: That the
most important thing

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
we can do while we're here
is to learn how to love,

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and that that's a difficult
thing even after you've

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.120 align:middle line:84%
had this vision, but
that it's worth pursuing.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%

people all over the world,

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%

about is learning to love.

particular time, though,

01:11:57.995 --> 01:11:59.890 align:middle line:84%
in history that
we're in right now,

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:03.607 align:middle line:84%
why do you think that is
so apparent right now?

01:12:03.607 --> 01:12:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Well, it's interesting.

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
There have always been
these experiences,

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and they were discussed
about in antiquity,

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
but the reason why we're
hearing so many these days,

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I conjecture, is
that the techniques

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
are refined to such an extent

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can bring a
lot more people back.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- I don't
want to draw a connection here,

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
but, I mean, to me it's a
rather remarkable coincidence

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that just at the time
where this is surfacing

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
as an undeniable thing-- we're
really into a situation now

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
where we can't turn away
from these experiences.

01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:47.560 align:middle line:90%
This is a reality.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And at that same time,
it looks like we're

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:53.420 align:middle line:84%
in a race with
ourselves to see who

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.390 align:middle line:90%
can destroy the planet first.

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:58.860 align:middle line:84%

a paradox here.

01:12:58.860 --> 01:12:59.510 align:middle line:90%

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I do.

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that people
have always said, oh, times

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:07.650 align:middle line:84%
are bad and so on, but we have a
different kind of evidence now.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
All the many things
that are going

01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
on-- the trouble with the
atmosphere, the climate

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
change, the proliferation
of nuclear weapons,

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:23.390 align:middle line:84%
the real chance that terrorists
will get a nuclear bomb

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and strike at a city-- all of
these things are pretty grim.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Plus, I think personally-- and
this is like being on a soapbox

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
to some degree,
but we've developed

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
a society here in America of
the immediate-gratification

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.220 align:middle line:84%
mentality, that
people want it now.

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.680 align:middle line:90%
They want it without effort.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.050 align:middle line:84%
They want it without
going through a process.

01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So it looks to me that
all of these things

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
are coming together
in a way that people

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.320 align:middle line:90%

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
They're wandering
around without a center.

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:58.455 align:middle line:84%
And they're wondering,
what's this all about?

01:13:58.455 --> 01:14:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's very scary
things going on in the world

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.000 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think this

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.980 align:middle line:90%
very comforting in that context.

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The way I've come
to think of it,

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, is-- and I'm speaking
kind of metaphorically here

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:17.890 align:middle line:84%
admittedly-- but I think
this thing we're in

01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:21.419 align:middle line:84%
is God's educate and
entertainment medium.

01:14:21.419 --> 01:14:22.710 align:middle line:90%

01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I mean I think
God is totally in charge here.

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Coming from a
non-religious person.

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, well,
I'm still not religious.

01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I talk to God all the
time, and he's never

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
said to me about going to
church or anything like that.

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what do you
mean, specifically what

01:14:39.915 --> 01:14:41.160 align:middle line:90%
you were talking about?

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I do think
that this life we're

01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in, that the explanation
of it lies outside of it.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I
sort of put it together

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
is that we're here in this
dimension and this kind

01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:02.820 align:middle line:84%
of physical framework
as participants

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:06.730 align:middle line:84%
analogously to people
in a play or a drama.

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the people
in that documentary

01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:11.220 align:middle line:90%
mentioned that.

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's, incidentally,
a point of view

01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that's in Hinduism, that
this is a large play.

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:21.660 align:middle line:90%


01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare, I think,
said something similar,

01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
like that all life is a stage.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:28.980 align:middle line:90%


01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I think we're here
for is to learn and also

01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:37.550 align:middle line:84%
to become more
loving, to develop--

01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:42.010 align:middle line:84%
learn how to love and to
develop loving relationships

01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:43.000 align:middle line:90%
with others.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think, to sort
of transcend ego.

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Ego equals pain, as
far as I can tell.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:51.450 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
few things that I've

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:53.710 align:middle line:84%
learned as a person
who's studied

01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
the mind is, that much
I'm sure of, ego is pain.

>>LISA: To one person
or the other, yes.

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: It's always pain.

01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mentioned
to me earlier

01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:06.510 align:middle line:90%
that you live an ego-less life.

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, and
that itself sounds

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:11.390 align:middle line:90%
like an egotistical statement.

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Which it would be if I said,
well, the way I've gotten

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
finished with the ego is that
I went up on the mountain

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and I did the chants, but
that's not how I did it.

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm
finished with the ego

01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:26.100 align:middle line:84%
is that I pretty near
killed myself with it.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And my particular ego
trip was jealousy.

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But once you go
through an ego trip,

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
you kind of realize that
all ego trips are the same.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Jealousy, control--
all of it's the same thing.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Exactly.

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And that, I'm sick
of myself in a way.

01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:46.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm through with Raymond Moody.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And part of this is just being
67 years old, because as people

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:55.440 align:middle line:84%
grow older we kind of
surrender these things.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think, like many
people in my age range,

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't think about
myself anymore.

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I think about--
what I want to do

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:08.070 align:middle line:84%
is try to help the
generations that are coming,

01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:10.280 align:middle line:90%
especially my kids.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, my kids
will be in a world

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.800 align:middle line:84%
where there are other
people their age.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.690 align:middle line:90%
So I really do.

01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this situation where,
like many other people

01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
in my age, I'm just-- I want to
try to help smooth things over

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:24.750 align:middle line:90%
for the people who are coming.

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:26.300 align:middle line:90%
I still enjoy myself, too.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.107 align:middle line:90%

of message would you

01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:32.990 align:middle line:90%
give the youth of today?

01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, one thing I would
say very severely, I mean now,

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
youth, the way it's
set up, they don't

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:40.480 align:middle line:84%
suppose to listen to
their elders, right,

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and they got to learn
it for themselves.

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But time's kind of running
out in a way for this society.

01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:52.220 align:middle line:84%
What I think more than anything
else we need to do is to,

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:56.800 align:middle line:84%
number one, get over this
instant gratification

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.600 align:middle line:90%
mentality.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.587 align:middle line:84%
Immediate gratification is
no gratification at all.

01:18:02.587 --> 01:18:04.295 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, with
the age of technology,

01:18:04.295 --> 01:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
it does-- it really puts
people into that space.

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yes, and
there is a great value

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.360 align:middle line:90%
in working through a process.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Then the second
thing I would say

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.560 align:middle line:84%
is that we've really got
to wake up to the fact

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that this information
about near-death

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
experiences as getting
harder, and harder, and harder

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
to dismiss or to say that,
well, this is the brain damage

01:18:29.730 --> 01:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, because it's not.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:37.020 align:middle line:84%
If the bystanders have the same
experience as the people who

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
are-- who almost die
and return, then it's

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.010 align:middle line:84%
not the oxygen
deprivation to the brain.

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:45.832 align:middle line:90%
Something else is going on.

01:18:45.832 --> 01:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The shared
death experience

01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:48.110 align:middle line:90%

>>MOODY: That's right.

01:18:49.026 --> 01:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
thing, which comes

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
from the near-death experience
and so on and these shared

01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:58.990 align:middle line:84%
death experiences, is that
what this is all about

01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:01.140 align:middle line:90%
is learning how to love.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And to get engrossed in the
ideology of your religion

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:11.460 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is
counterproductive to this.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.220 align:middle line:84%

religion's ideology is to love?

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, yeah.

Well, that's what I mean
is-- but let's face it.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.520 align:middle line:84%
On TV, we see a lot of
people who aren't so loving.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I saw Franklin
Graham on CNN today,

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.850 align:middle line:84%

very mean-spirited person,

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:29.190 align:middle line:90%
to tell you the truth.

01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Like he's got the insight
into Jesus, and the rest of us

01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:34.760 align:middle line:90%
are scum.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:36.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:40.700 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have anything to do
with what religious ideology

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.270 align:middle line:90%
you subscribe to.

01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:44.830 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
kind of life you lead

01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:49.289 align:middle line:84%

be loving to other people.

01:21:39.105 --> 01:21:41.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the fact.

01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Because what we've
done in the West

01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:48.470 align:middle line:84%
is that we've made a kind
of God out of science.

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is
that science is not

01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:54.090 align:middle line:90%
going to solve all our problems.

01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So TO-- at this point
in the 21st century,

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
to try to imply to
people that this

01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
can be a scientific
question is not valid.

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And that mistake sort of
casts dispersions there

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:13.350 align:middle line:84%
on all of us who investigate
near-death experiences.

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:16.690 align:middle line:84%
What I want to say
is that we are now

01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
very close to having
entirely new rational means

01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
of investigating this
question that are going to be,

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:28.649 align:middle line:90%
when this comes out, astounding.

01:22:28.649 --> 01:22:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, what do you mean?

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, what I mean is
that the real question when

01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
we-- and there's
a big difference

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:38.370 align:middle line:90%
between rational and scientific.

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Rational is a larger
category than scientific.

01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:47.140 align:middle line:84%
One category of reason
is scientific inquiry,

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:51.520 align:middle line:84%
but scientific inquiry is
only about 400 years old.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We've had reason for a
much longer period of time.

01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And the real
difficulty in thinking

01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:03.300 align:middle line:84%
about the possibility of a
rational proof of an afterlife

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
was best stated by a wonderful
thinker named David Hume.

01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And to date him for you, he
was a friend of Ben Franklin's.

01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Hume lived from 1711 to 1776.

01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:21.260 align:middle line:84%
He's well known as one of the
people who was kind of got

01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:23.980 align:middle line:90%
scientific thinking on its feet.

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And he made some
brilliant insights

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
into inductive logic,
which scientists use,

01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and also into the
notion of causality

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:34.910 align:middle line:90%
that we have in science.

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And Hume said more succinctly
than anybody else ever said,

01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
he pointed out the
real difficulty

01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:48.210 align:middle line:84%
in investigating this question
of life after death rationally.

01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And what Hume said was, "by
the mere light of reason,

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:57.880 align:middle line:84%
it seems difficult to prove
the immortality of the soul."

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Then he went on to say,
"some new species of logic

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
is requisite for that purpose,
and some new faculties

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
of the mind that they may enable
us to comprehend that logic."

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, for a long time,
that has been regarded

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.800 align:middle line:84%
as a sort of ironical
statement and that

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.120 align:middle line:84%
really what he was getting
at is that it's impossible.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the logic that we've
inherited from Aristotle

01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:27.530 align:middle line:84%
has served us well
for 2,300 years.

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it doesn't
seem very likely

01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that we could come up with
a new system of logic.

01:24:32.610 --> 01:24:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And also we think we know
our minds pretty well,

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:38.005 align:middle line:84%
so the idea that there could
be these hidden faculties

01:24:38.005 --> 01:24:41.330 align:middle line:90%
of the mind seems implausible.

01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I am just perfectly
confident in sitting here

01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and saying to you is that
problem has now been solved.

01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We do have a new
system of logic,

01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:54.910 align:middle line:84%
not to replace
Aristotle's logic,

01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
but to supplement it in
these areas which heretofore

01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
have fallen outside of
the process of logic.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And through this, we
find that we can actually

01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:10.430 align:middle line:84%
open up these hidden
faculties of the mind

01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:13.110 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't know we had.

01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:16.574 align:middle line:84%
And what this-- the
implication of this is

01:25:16.574 --> 01:25:22.490 align:middle line:84%
is that this results in entirely
new ways of genuinely rational

01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:25.780 align:middle line:84%
investigation of this
question of life after death.

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And what we are
doing now, we are

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
people who are learning
this new logic.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:37.410 align:middle line:84%
When, just by chance
in the future,

01:25:37.410 --> 01:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
they happen to have a
near-death experience,

01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
will be able to come back
and talk about it to us

01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:45.450 align:middle line:90%
in an entirely new way.

01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is this new
logic you're talking about?

01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well,
basically the difficulty

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.840 align:middle line:84%
with the notion of life after
death from the point of view

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of regular logic is that
it's a self-contradiction.

01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
When you say, there
is life after death,

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:03.960 align:middle line:84%
if you look up the meanings
of those words, that's

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:06.360 align:middle line:84%
an outright
self-contradiction, and it

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
doesn't fit into
Aristotelian logic.

01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:12.890 align:middle line:84%
What we now have is
a new kind of logic

01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that helps us
comprehend things that

01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:18.900 align:middle line:84%
are unintelligible from the
point of view of regular logic.

01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm completely
confident in sitting here

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and saying to you is that now
we have, in effect, a logic

01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:28.280 align:middle line:90%
of the unintelligible.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And when people know this
logic of the unintelligible

01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:35.442 align:middle line:84%
and then subsequently they
have a near-death experience,

01:26:35.442 --> 01:26:36.900 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
come back and they

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.820 align:middle line:84%
won't have the same
difficulty that people

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.822 align:middle line:84%
have had of putting it
into words because they

01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:44.030 align:middle line:90%
have a new logical framework.

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:45.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And this is
already bearing some fruit.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So stay tuned, because in
the not-too-distant future,

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:57.630 align:middle line:84%
we are going to have--
well, I'll put it this way.

01:26:57.630 --> 01:27:05.400 align:middle line:84%
There has now been a solid
step of genuine progress

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
toward the rational
comprehension of the biggest

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.760 align:middle line:90%
mystery of human existence.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.130 align:middle line:84%
That is, the question
of life after death.

01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So we are now into
an era where we're

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:23.350 align:middle line:84%
going to have new means of
investigating this and entirely

01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:27.700 align:middle line:84%
unique methods that have never
been done before where we will

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:34.969 align:middle line:84%
actually be able to track people
right as they cross over--

01:27:34.969 --> 01:27:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to tell me what
some of those new means are.

01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:39.218 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you're at
the forefront of this.

01:27:39.218 --> 01:27:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, one
is that we have

01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:46.840 align:middle line:84%
a way now where-- have you-- one
thing that may sound startling

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
but that many of our viewers
will be able to relate to is

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that its a very common
phenomenon that,

01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
as people are in their
final stage of dying,

01:27:56.970 --> 01:28:01.290 align:middle line:84%
like the last days or hours of
life, that they talk nonsense,

01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
that they're talking but you
can't make any sense of it.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a logic that's
going to be able to understand

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.980 align:middle line:84%
those enigmatic
conversations of the dying

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:18.070 align:middle line:84%
so that we can actually sort of
follow people as they go across

01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:20.120 align:middle line:84%
into this other
state of existence.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have heard that
from various hospice workers.

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:26.670 align:middle line:84%
That I had the experience
of watching my husband's

01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
great grandmother pass, and--
peacefully in the house.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And we, through the days
leading up to her final passing,

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.670 align:middle line:84%
was communicating with
different people beyond.

01:28:39.670 --> 01:28:42.922 align:middle line:84%
And the hospice worker said
this is very, very common,

01:28:42.922 --> 01:28:44.380 align:middle line:84%
which we heard in
one of the clips.

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.588 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, yes, absolutely.

01:28:45.588 --> 01:28:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is what you
hear, and you're tracking this.

01:28:48.130 --> 01:28:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yes, we'll actually
be able now to track this.

01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's ha-- I wasn't
really anticipating this.

01:28:54.650 --> 01:28:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I am a logician, and
I developed my system

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of logic quite outside of the
question of life after death,

01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:08.010 align:middle line:84%
but it happens to be
very apropos and germane.

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So it gives us an
entirely new means

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.590 align:middle line:84%
of investigating
the question of life

01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
after death and many
other questions that

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:18.340 align:middle line:84%
have thus far eluded
rational comprehension.

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's not scientific.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.430 align:middle line:84%
It's more
philosophical, however,

01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:27.716 align:middle line:84%
circles back to new realms
of scientific thinking.

01:29:27.716 --> 01:29:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: If you look
at it in the past,

01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
always when a new question
comes into rational domain,

01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:40.780 align:middle line:84%
it's a conceptual advance first,
and then it becomes scientific.

01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm noticing that
in very different circles,

01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
as well, about the new emergent
human and the new humanity.

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is what was on the
forefront of all science

01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and humanity sciences,
which is great.

01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And because of these
conceptual advances that

01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:01.720 align:middle line:84%
have been made, it could be
that in the future, then,

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:04.880 align:middle line:84%
this will become a properly
scientific question.

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's got to go first
through the conceptual side

01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:10.161 align:middle line:90%
before it can be scientific.

01:30:10.161 --> 01:30:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Into the new
science, we will say.

01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well.
