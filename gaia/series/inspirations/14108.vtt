[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:19.486 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hello and welcome
to "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.323 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to you live
from Boulder, Colorado,

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.325 align:middle line:84%
here at the Gaiam
studios in Boulder.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.895 align:middle line:84%
And since this is a
live, interactive show,

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:30.831 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to communicate
with us through Facebook

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.799 align:middle line:84%
and Twitter and all
sorts of different ways

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.468 align:middle line:84%
so that we can hear from
you throughout the show.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:35.969 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have an opportunity

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.106 align:middle line:84%
to ask the doctor some questions
throughout the show as well.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.075 align:middle line:84%
So keep connecting with us
through Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.511 align:middle line:84%
So today we're
talking about pain

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:47.047 align:middle line:84%
and the number of
natural remedies

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that there are for pain
control and pain relief.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.686 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many different
remedies, as a matter of fact,

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:56.189 align:middle line:84%
about 50 plus that Dr.
Shealy is aware of.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.258 align:middle line:84%
And my guest today
is Dr. Norm Shealy.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.459 align:middle line:90%
He's a neuroscientist.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.763 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder of the American
Holistic Medical Association.

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:06.033 align:middle line:84%
And he created the TENS unit,
the Transcutaneous Electrical

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.569 align:middle line:84%
Nerve Stimulation device--
I got that out [LAUGHS]--

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.238 align:middle line:90%
45 years ago.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.039 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a person
on this planet that

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.942 align:middle line:84%
knows about pain control,
it's Doctor Shealy.

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.411 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. NORM SHEALY: Oh,
It's pleasure, Lisa.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.845 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's great
to have you here.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.714 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit about-- I mentioned

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:25.085 align:middle line:84%
50 plus different types of pain
remedy or pain control devices

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:25.886 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:28.488 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, I mean, we could
go back centuries, of course,

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:31.525 align:middle line:84%
to certain things like
acupuncture and acupressure.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:32.392 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:35.429 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And mental
things that developed

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.031 align:middle line:84%
from some of the ancient
mental techniques that became

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.901 align:middle line:90%
hypnosis and self-hypnosis.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.869 align:middle line:84%
And then, of
course, acupressure.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.503 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why did so
many of those things

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:47.607 align:middle line:84%
get deleted from the
medical community?

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.209 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Because
they don't make money

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.344 align:middle line:90%
for the Pharmaca Mafia.

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.112 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Sorry.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.981 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's truly stated.

00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:56.883 align:middle line:84%
So basically they're
not profitable.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.919 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: It's right.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.723 align:middle line:84%
In general, if it can't
make a huge profit,

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:04.157 align:middle line:90%
nobody's interested.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.093 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is true
about herbs and all sorts

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:06.126 align:middle line:90%
of different things.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:06.626 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yeah.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:07.227 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: On the
other hand, I believe

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.999 align:middle line:84%
that we should do all
the natural, simple,

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.468 align:middle line:90%
and safe things.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
If it's not safe,
I'm not interested.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.337 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very good.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.238 align:middle line:90%
No, that's very clear.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:21.875 align:middle line:84%
And as your-- with your vast
experience as a neurosurgeon,

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.777 align:middle line:84%
you know exactly what
works and what doesn't.

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.312 align:middle line:84%
I like the fact that
you come at this

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
from a scientific
perspective and you

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.283 align:middle line:84%
do studies and research and
clinical studies as well.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.553 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, there should
be an outcome of anything.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.223 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
modern things that

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.992 align:middle line:84%
are being used alternatively
haven't been adequately

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:90%
studied yet.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.795 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I've
done several studies

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:45.465 align:middle line:84%
on homeopathy--
phenomenal sometimes.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:48.802 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I published
a paper on the use

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of homeopathic preparation
for osteoarthritic knee pain,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.742 align:middle line:90%
which is better than Tylenol.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.676 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.244 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: No.

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:58.512 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Through homeopathy.

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.047 align:middle line:90%
See, that's really wonderful.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:02.482 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you're
here, is to share with us

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.317 align:middle line:84%
some of the devices,
some of the techniques,

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.119 align:middle line:90%
just a glimpse into your world.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.955 align:middle line:84%
And my idea here is just
to get this information

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.657 align:middle line:84%
into the awareness of
people so that they

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
can start to make
choices and have

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.796 align:middle line:84%
different decisions,
different options, available.

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:18.065 align:middle line:84%
So here is a little bit
of the demonstration.

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the updated, improved
times a million TENS unit,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.703 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:24.271 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's correct.

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.806 align:middle line:84%
This is the one
that-- actually, it's

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.774 align:middle line:84%
the only one I put
my own name on.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:31.511 align:middle line:84%
This puts out human
DNA frequency,

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:36.917 align:middle line:84%
54 to 78 billion
cycles per second

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:41.254 align:middle line:84%
at a billionth of a watt,
which is 1,000 times

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.555 align:middle line:90%
below any risk factor.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.523 align:middle line:90%
That's how safe it is.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:45.725 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so it's
extremely-- less, of course,

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
less invasive than a
cellphone would be.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.793 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:51.264 align:middle line:84%
And when you put this on
specific acupuncture points,

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:54.601 align:middle line:90%
it recharges that system.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So specific
acupuncture points

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.738 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with whatever
you're needing to remedy.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.073 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Whatever you're doing.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
When I visited the Ukraine
about 16 years ago,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.612 align:middle line:84%
at the Endocrinology
Institute they

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:09.683 align:middle line:84%
were treating diabetes only
by putting these frequencies

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:12.252 align:middle line:90%
into Hoku, these two points.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.054 align:middle line:84%
At the Cardiology
Institute, where

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:17.923 align:middle line:84%
there were 420 cardiologists
in one building,

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
they were treating angina
pectoris, heart pain,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.896 align:middle line:84%
only by putting it
through these two points.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.132 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
strongest point in the body.

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:26.967 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why is this the
strongest point in the body?

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.335 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well,
energetically, it

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:31.138 align:middle line:84%
has more connections
than any other point.

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:32.272 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the hands.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:32.906 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yeah.

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:37.644 align:middle line:84%
Well remember, you have
more-- in your brain,

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:42.649 align:middle line:84%
more space for the thumbs than
any other part of the body.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:46.086 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that the largest part
of the brain, inside the brain,

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:47.354 align:middle line:90%
the development of the brain--

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:48.588 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.423 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --operates
the opposable thumbs?

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.324 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:52.993 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this-- what
distinguishes people

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:58.565 align:middle line:84%
from all other known animals
is the use of the thumb.

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:01.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so this is
where most of our nerves

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.904 align:middle line:84%
are related to
functions of body?

00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:06.206 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, it's the one
that has more connections.

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.042 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And it just
has, because there's

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.710 align:middle line:84%
more space up here
in the brain, there's

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.112 align:middle line:84%
more connections with
the rest of the body.

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:12.412 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.079 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:16.816 align:middle line:84%
So this particular unit, you
use human-- the frequency

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.752 align:middle line:84%
of the actual person
that's using the device.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:21.121 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, all of us
have the same frequency,

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:25.091 align:middle line:84%
a random 54 to 78 billion
cycles per second.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And we don't lose that
frequency until we're dead.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.865 align:middle line:90%
We lose the strength of it.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:34.768 align:middle line:84%
And so this is like recharging
the battery of your cells.

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:37.103 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long does it take
to do something like that?

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:39.005 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Oh, depending
on what you're doing,

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:43.076 align:middle line:84%
three minutes for an acupuncture
point, a pair of points.

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:46.213 align:middle line:84%
And most of the circuits don't
last more than 21 minutes,

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:47.581 align:middle line:90%
18 to 21 minutes.

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:50.016 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And do you use
this device yourself?

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Of course.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.518 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day?

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.553 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, no, because
I have other things.

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:53.987 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:54.421 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, I know.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.122 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into the other things.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.991 align:middle line:84%
He has an amazing
amount of-- all right.

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:00.126 align:middle line:90%
So this one is the Relax Mate.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.195 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Yeah, this
is for relaxation.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.998 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So this is rejuvenation?

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:06.499 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It's for
stress reduction.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:11.171 align:middle line:84%
This is for people who
can't turn their mind off.

00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:13.506 align:middle line:84%
Within five minutes,
90% of people

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:16.176 align:middle line:90%
are in deep, deep relaxation.

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:18.311 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So this is for anxiety.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.346 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:22.015 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: It assists with sleep.

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.582 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for people
who are depressed,

00:06:23.582 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I use the other device we're
going to talk about plus this.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.722 align:middle line:84%
And between the
two of them, we get

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.324 align:middle line:84%
85% of people out of depression
within two weeks without drugs.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:33.994 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about grief?

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:39.432 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Grief-- we go back
to the other stimulator.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:39.933 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:41.368 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It would
be much better

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:44.337 align:middle line:84%
to use the transcranial
stimulator and the one

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:45.939 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk
about later, Bliss.

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:46.439 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.943 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: I found that--
myself in the past year

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:51.645 align:middle line:90%
have dealt with that.

00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:53.046 align:middle line:90%
And it was wonderful.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:54.648 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it really
has assisted you.

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:55.548 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, heavens, yes.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:56.582 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.019 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: I've used this
more in the last year

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:00.954 align:middle line:84%
than I have in the
previous 30 years.

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:03.456 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I know that you
lost a loved one this last year.

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:05.792 align:middle line:84%
And to find something
that has actually

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.461 align:middle line:84%
helped you be in
this great state

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:10.397 align:middle line:84%
and help other people
still is wonderful.

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:10.797 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, yeah.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
It's phenomenal.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.033 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting reports
all over the country

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:14.267 align:middle line:90%
from people doing this.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.135 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:15.902 align:middle line:90%
That is wonderful.

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:17.103 align:middle line:90%
So this is?

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.272 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: This is called
the LISS Cranial Electrical

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Stimulator.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.177 align:middle line:84%
This you apply to the head
for an hour in the morning.

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
finished before noon.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.716 align:middle line:84%
And it raises your serotonin
and your beta endorphin

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
for the whole day and sets
you back into a normal rhythm.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.856 align:middle line:84%
This alone will get 50% of
people out of depression

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:39.793 align:middle line:84%
within two weeks
without drugs, safely.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.561 align:middle line:84%
And there's not an
antidepressant drug

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.063 align:middle line:84%
in the world that's
better than 42%,

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:44.597 align:middle line:90%
and they have complications.

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:45.732 align:middle line:90%
No complications with this.

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That-- [LAUGHS]-- I
don't think there's much more

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.303 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be said other
than the fact that what is

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.639 align:middle line:84%
the response that you've
received from the people,

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
the clinical response.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.109 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Oh, some
people come out

00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.011 align:middle line:84%
of depression
within a day or two.

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.146 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that circumstantial
or is that chemical?

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.081 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, yeah.

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:02.115 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's chemical.

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:05.118 align:middle line:84%
Because this strongly
raises serotonin.

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.621 align:middle line:84%
See, most people with depression
are low in serotonin and beta

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:90%
endorphin, the natural narcotic.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.294 align:middle line:84%
So both of those come up within
20 minutes after you-- in fact,

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:16.363 align:middle line:84%
we not only proved
it in the blood,

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:18.732 align:middle line:84%
we actually did spinal
taps and measured it

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:20.467 align:middle line:90%
in the cerebral spinal fluid.

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:21.968 align:middle line:84%
I was the first
subject, of course.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:22.769 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my gosh.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:23.803 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: I'm an
experiential junkie.

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:26.339 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] You must be
to do something like that.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.841 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's amazing.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.609 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing technology.

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:33.011 align:middle line:84%
And I know at your institute,
at the Shealy Institute,

00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:36.582 align:middle line:84%
you have this times-- a
lot more elaborate devices

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:38.284 align:middle line:84%
that are at the
actual institute.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.786 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: We have
a great playpen.

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:40.286 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.888 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You call that a playpen.

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:42.389 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.657 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I want to share
some of this with you,

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:47.927 align:middle line:84%
some of the photos that
Dr. Shealy has here.

00:08:47.927 --> 00:08:48.428 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:49.596 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:08:49.596 --> 00:08:51.197 align:middle line:90%
This is at your location, right?

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.365 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: This the Baytar.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.535 align:middle line:90%
This is a vibratory music bed.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:09:00.173 align:middle line:84%
10 speakers in the bed itself
and another 10 around the room.

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:05.345 align:middle line:84%
And this makes you
so deeply relaxed.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It raises beta endorphin.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.449 align:middle line:84%
It allows people who are
depressed to bring it

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:11.351 align:middle line:90%
up and get it out.

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:13.386 align:middle line:90%
And it's just fabulous.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.221 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one night
in a snowstorm,

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.723 align:middle line:90%
I decided to sleep on it.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.125 align:middle line:84%
After three hours,
I was so energized

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.727 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't stay up any longer.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.762 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And where you
going to go in a snowstorm?

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:84%
So does this have
anything in the mattress

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:90%
other than the speakers?

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.767 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's all.

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.302 align:middle line:90%
Just the music.

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:32.505 align:middle line:84%
One of our students has done
her research on live blood,

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.474 align:middle line:84%
looking at it under
the microscope.

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:38.077 align:middle line:84%
And it markedly decreases the
ability of the blood to clot.

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:38.711 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:39.546 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Yeah,
just by feeling it.

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:41.147 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it
increases circulation.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Yeah, feeling the
music as well as hearing it.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.918 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you
mentioned you had

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.086 align:middle line:84%
another one that
had crystals in it.

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:48.054 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Ah, OK.

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.622 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's the Rejuvamatrix.

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:53.827 align:middle line:84%
That was for rejuvenating,
regrowing, telomeres.

00:09:53.827 --> 00:09:56.362 align:middle line:84%
Average telomere,
the tips of your DNA,

00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:58.465 align:middle line:84%
those little double
strand things,

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:02.335 align:middle line:84%
those are what allow the
cell to reproduce itself

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:03.803 align:middle line:90%
every seven years or less.

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:05.138 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Reproduce healthy cells.

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:05.805 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:11.878 align:middle line:84%
But ordinarily, you lose
1% every year of life.

00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:15.648 align:middle line:84%
And using the bed that has a
copper screen in the middle

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:18.685 align:middle line:84%
with a pound of crushed
sapphire crystal on it

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:21.521 align:middle line:84%
connected to a Tesla
coil, we actually

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.057 align:middle line:90%
are regrowing telomeres.

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:27.093 align:middle line:84%
Our best one is a
50-year-old woman

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:30.163 align:middle line:84%
whose telomeres grew
30.8% in two years.

00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:31.498 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you measure that?

00:10:31.498 --> 00:10:32.732 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: With a blood test.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:33.233 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK

00:10:33.233 --> 00:10:35.835 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: We send it off
to a lab in Vancouver.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:36.603 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.105 align:middle line:84%
So now, the copper,
does it somehow

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.674 align:middle line:84%
activate the crystal
through the cord?

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:42.242 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yes.

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:42.909 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How does that work?

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:44.377 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, I
have to tell you.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:48.915 align:middle line:84%
The reason this came is I got
an intuitive knowledge years ago

00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:52.418 align:middle line:84%
that crushed
sapphire would bypass

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:54.721 align:middle line:90%
the need for bypass surgery.

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:56.222 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm not a cardiologist.

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:58.191 align:middle line:84%
So I just decided to put
it in the Rejuvamatrix

00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
because heart disease
is still the number one

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.995 align:middle line:90%
cause of recycling.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:02.929 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:04.764 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Nicely said.

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:06.699 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: So I figured
everybody can use it.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.068 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And that's
why the crushed sapphire

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:11.604 align:middle line:84%
is there, amplifies
the frequency.

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.473 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what
does the copper do?

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:17.377 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, it allows
these human DNA frequencies,

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:21.281 align:middle line:84%
54 to 78 billion,
to be everywhere.

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:84%
You're in a field
that's about this deep.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.617 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.452 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Your whole
body is bathed in them.

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.488 align:middle line:84%
And you absorb them
through the skin.

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:31.324 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you mentioned
there was a cord that also--

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:34.928 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: The Tesla coil
is an electrical device

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:36.529 align:middle line:90%
that activates the copper.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.897 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Fascinating,
fascinating.

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:38.197 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:38.698 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.899 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:44.737 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, all about the
amazing amount of technology

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:49.108 align:middle line:84%
and resources out there in order
to reduce pain and depression.

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.476 align:middle line:90%
There are many.

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.611 align:middle line:90%
This is just a glimpse.

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:52.612 align:middle line:90%
What is this one?

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:55.348 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Oh, now that's
the gold iodide bed.

00:11:55.348 --> 00:11:59.085 align:middle line:84%
There's one ton of
gold iodide crystals

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:00.453 align:middle line:90%
in that bed under that mat.

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:01.788 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can't
take that everywhere.

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:02.922 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And this is-- no.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:09.596 align:middle line:84%
This is pure yin energy,
this total relaxation.

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:11.397 align:middle line:84%
And we have another
similar bed that

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:17.403 align:middle line:84%
has one ton of mica crystal,
pure yang energy, for energy.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:20.173 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's sleeping
on a bed of crystal.

00:12:20.173 --> 00:12:21.808 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Sleeping
on a bed of crystal.

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For how long
do you sleep there?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.346 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Oh, you can sleep
all night on that safely.

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:28.948 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes is enough to
make a huge difference

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:29.649 align:middle line:90%
physiologically.

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:31.718 align:middle line:84%
We've measured all
kinds of changes.

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.353 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does it do exactly?

00:12:33.353 --> 00:12:36.789 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, it
reduces stress, basically.

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:39.392 align:middle line:84%
Without any thinking, without
having to do anything,

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:40.927 align:middle line:90%
it just-- you know.

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.595 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It reduces
your stress, but what

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:45.131 align:middle line:90%
about effects of prior stress?

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:49.469 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, all
emotional disorders

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:53.906 align:middle line:84%
are largely the result
of anxiety and fear.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:58.478 align:middle line:84%
And so by reducing the
physiological response to that,

00:12:58.478 --> 00:13:00.246 align:middle line:90%
it can be tremendously helpful.

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:00.813 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:01.581 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely true.

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:02.315 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:03.249 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:05.351 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like a
very comfortable bed, but--

00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:07.286 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, it's not
on an angle like that.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:08.388 align:middle line:90%
It is flat. [LAUGHS]

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:09.155 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's good.

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:10.256 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't got four posters.

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:11.591 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:13.192 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: This is
one of my favorites.

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:14.227 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:16.529 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: This is one
ton of quartz crystal.

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:17.797 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where do you get this?

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:18.731 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, from Mt.

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:19.832 align:middle line:90%
Ida, Arkansas.

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:21.567 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I built it.

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:23.336 align:middle line:84%
But I had this
idea 30 years ago,

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:26.039 align:middle line:84%
and we only built
it 10 years ago.

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:30.877 align:middle line:84%
And so the entire walls and
ceiling are pure quartz.

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:36.783 align:middle line:84%
You walk in there, I mean,
within seconds you feel wow,

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:38.051 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah.

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:42.155 align:middle line:84%
And it just totally
takes away-- I

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.123 align:middle line:84%
feel as if I'm in another
dimension in there.

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.725 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where do
you get the idea

00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:48.795 align:middle line:84%
to build a room made
out of quartz crystal?

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:50.697 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well,
I have a lot of--

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:53.332 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most people would put it
on their fingers or something.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.067 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: [LAUGHS]

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:56.169 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where do
you get this idea?

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: It just came to me.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.571 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: All my ideas
come out of the cosmos.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.975 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you actually
have to execute them.

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:03.042 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Well, that's right.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.178 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: That's a lot of
structure to build there.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.147 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, yeah, that
took a little construction,

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:10.049 align:middle line:90%
but five of us did it in a week.

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:11.084 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A little bit.

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:12.618 align:middle line:90%
OK, and what is this one?

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:14.353 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now that is
a hot tub surrounded

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.623 align:middle line:90%
by six tons of mica crystal.

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:21.828 align:middle line:84%
All the way down to the floor
around that entire hot tub

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:24.497 align:middle line:84%
is mica crystal,
which re-energizes.

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:84%
If you take the water that has
been imprinted by the mica,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.605 align:middle line:84%
not in the tub, but around
it, and put it in grass seed

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:37.243 align:middle line:84%
and compare it with plain water,
in one week the grass grows

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:41.547 align:middle line:84%
20% more weight-- cut it
all off and measure it--

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:42.548 align:middle line:90%
than plain water.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.951 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because all the water
is in its perfect formation?

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:46.285 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: It has been energized.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.253 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Most likely?

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yeah.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.689 align:middle line:84%
You have an affinity with
crystal, I might say.

00:14:49.689 --> 00:14:51.224 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: [LAUGHS]
I do love crystal.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.658 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.527 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, we
are crystalline.

00:14:54.527 --> 00:14:59.499 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you are a giant
quartz-like crystal.

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:02.635 align:middle line:84%
Your bones, your muscles,
your tendons, and even

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:05.138 align:middle line:84%
your intestines
are piezoelectric,

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:08.708 align:middle line:84%
which means that any physical
pressure, including-- put

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:11.244 align:middle line:84%
your hand on top of
your head and just hum.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.411 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH HUM]

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:12.912 align:middle line:90%
Feel it?

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:13.412 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:15.181 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Your entire
body is getting that.

00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:18.851 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk, your skeleton
is being imprinted by it,

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:22.388 align:middle line:84%
because it converts
pressure into electricity.

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.689 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: So each of us is
a giant quartz-like crystal.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.694 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:31.063 align:middle line:84%
Operating constantly
in that circuitry.

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:32.365 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:37.336 align:middle line:84%
And remember, quartz can
send, receive, and store

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:38.771 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic energy.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:39.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:90%
The right kind.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Of course.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.743 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can it defend against
the wrong kind as well?

00:15:43.743 --> 00:15:44.477 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:15:44.477 --> 00:15:46.579 align:middle line:90%
If you prime it properly.

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:47.413 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:47.914 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:49.715 align:middle line:84%
So now speaking of
priming it properly,

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:51.317 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do
some techniques here,

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.753 align:middle line:84%
some exercises you guys
can do along with us

00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that you can do at home, you
can do right now, yourself,

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.126 align:middle line:84%
that are completely cost
effective because they're free.

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:02.562 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And so these
are different ways

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:04.864 align:middle line:84%
that you-- these are tapping
on various meridian points

00:16:04.864 --> 00:16:06.833 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Shealy is going
to show us in order

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate natural hormonal
production, various chemicals

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.737 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:12.605 align:middle line:90%
What's the first one?

00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:15.808 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Let's start with
fire, because fire-- most people

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.477 align:middle line:90%
are losing fire from burnout.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.779 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, burnout.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And so there
are 12 specific points

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.487 align:middle line:84%
which, when stimulated, raise
DHEA primarily, but also

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:32.258 align:middle line:84%
testosterone in men, because
testosterone, of course,

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:33.726 align:middle line:84%
can be made out of
DHEA ultimately.

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:36.162 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's related to
energy and all sorts of things,

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:36.796 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:38.731 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Health in
every conceivable way.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.499 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And DHEA is
responsible for--

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.568 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY:
Dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA,

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.804 align:middle line:84%
is considered the
mother hormone.

00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:48.741 align:middle line:84%
There's more of it in the
body than any other hormone.

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:51.143 align:middle line:84%
It is related to
your immune system,

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:52.645 align:middle line:90%
to your health in general.

00:16:52.645 --> 00:16:55.081 align:middle line:90%
It is anti-inflammatory.

00:16:55.081 --> 00:16:56.949 align:middle line:90%
It's essential for good health.

00:16:56.949 --> 00:17:00.152 align:middle line:84%
You reach a peak
at age 25, average.

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:03.222 align:middle line:84%
By age 30, most people
are already losing it.

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:05.992 align:middle line:84%
By age 80, the vast
majority of people

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:10.296 align:middle line:84%
have a DHEA less than 10%
of what they had at age 30.

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:12.865 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is what
causes degeneration, disease.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:13.633 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And so what we found
is a number of techniques.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.704 align:middle line:84%
But the first one
that was major was

00:17:19.704 --> 00:17:21.473 align:middle line:90%
stimulating the Ring of Fire.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.776 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
take my shoes off,

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:25.144 align:middle line:90%
just so we can show it easily.

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:26.479 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Try this at home, folks.

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:27.179 align:middle line:90%
Try this at home.

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: We'll start.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.915 align:middle line:84%
This point right
here, if you come--

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:30.983 align:middle line:90%
the long bone of the big toe.

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:33.486 align:middle line:84%
Right there, there's a
joint, and of course you

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:34.754 align:middle line:90%
want to do both of them.

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:35.755 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tapping on that.

00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:38.424 align:middle line:84%
And so the tapping sends the
electrical signal to the--

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:39.458 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:40.526 align:middle line:90%
And that's all it takes.

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:43.496 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that tapping has
activated those points.

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.864 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Now--

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:45.731 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are you trying this?

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:46.232 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.868 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Come up from
that to the pubic bone.

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:49.669 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:52.738 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And if you put your
finger in the belly button,

move around to the spine
and an inch off to the side,

00:17:56.709 --> 00:18:01.213 align:middle line:84%
this is Conception Vessel 2
and Bladder 22 on the left.

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:02.248 align:middle line:90%

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:02.815 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:03.716 align:middle line:90%
All right.

doesn't get hurt.

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you put a finger
just below the belly button

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.425 align:middle line:90%
and to the right side.

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:15.895 align:middle line:84%
So this is Conception Vessel
6 and Bladder 22 on the right.

00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:90%
And you tap those.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.731 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:18.731 --> 00:18:20.933 align:middle line:84%

>>SHEALY: And it's

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.539 align:middle line:90%
And now you move up.

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:28.507 align:middle line:84%
And I generally
do these separate,

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.977 align:middle line:84%
because you could do that,
but it's a little cumbersome.

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:33.446 align:middle line:84%
So the Master of the Heart

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.447 align:middle line:90%
and something.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:38.784 align:middle line:84%
This is the control center for

if you will-- system.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:45.257 align:middle line:84%
So this quiets it
down in this case.

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:46.826 align:middle line:84%
So you want to get
that one quiet.

00:18:46.826 --> 00:18:50.563 align:middle line:84%

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.045 align:middle line:90%
And you tap.

00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:07.913 align:middle line:84%
You feel the bone when

Governing Vessel 20.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.659 align:middle line:84%
Now you want to bring
the thyroid into it.

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:23.763 align:middle line:84%
And you go just below that
little hump in the second rib

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:26.599 align:middle line:90%

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.367 align:middle line:84%

adrenal glands,
thyroid, pituitary.

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
because of the FDA,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.919 align:middle line:84%

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.948 align:middle line:84%
The Ring of Air is
a 13-point system

00:21:55.948 --> 00:21:59.518 align:middle line:84%
that raises a neurochemical
called neurotensin,

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:01.754 align:middle line:90%
which we produce in the brain.

00:22:01.754 --> 00:22:08.994 align:middle line:84%
Neurotensin is a pain reliever
and a tremendous mood reliever.

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:13.399 align:middle line:84%
It also raises oxytocin, the
hormone that makes you feel--

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:14.466 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The happy hormone.

We've demonstrated this.

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:22.741 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
more recently I've

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:25.844 align:middle line:84%
found that a very
powerful way of activating

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:30.182 align:middle line:84%
this particular circuit is
applying specific essential oil

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:33.552 align:middle line:84%
mixtures, which I
call Bliss, to the 13

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:35.054 align:middle line:90%

00:22:35.054 --> 00:22:36.455 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
with your hands.

00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:38.457 align:middle line:84%

this to thousands

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:40.292 align:middle line:90%

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:36.949 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:39.518 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And this is
where kundalini rises.

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you come
to the very top,

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.623 align:middle line:84%
because you want that energy
circulating all the way up.

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:45.357 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:46.191 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:51.063 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now, then you
come under the collarbone,

00:23:51.063 --> 00:23:52.131 align:middle line:90%
right at the shoulder.

00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.033 align:middle line:90%
It should be very tender.

00:23:54.033 --> 00:23:55.734 align:middle line:90%
And you can do it this way.

00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:56.802 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or one at at time?

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.137 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Or one at a time.

00:23:58.137 --> 00:24:01.507 align:middle line:84%
You get a little more oomph
when you do it one at a time.

00:24:01.507 --> 00:24:05.911 align:middle line:84%
Then you go halfway across
the base of the skull.

00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:07.279 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
depression there

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.881 align:middle line:90%
between tendinous attachments.

00:24:08.881 --> 00:24:10.115 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:13.018 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's Gallbladder 20.

00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:14.353 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:24:14.353 --> 00:24:15.554 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My favorite point.

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.323 align:middle line:84%
The top of the head,
activates everything.

00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:18.524 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Well, that's right.

00:24:18.524 --> 00:24:19.958 align:middle line:90%
It's over the pineal.

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:22.461 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I want to hear from
you via Facebook and Twitter.

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:24.129 align:middle line:90%
Let me know if you tried that.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.864 align:middle line:84%
What is the response
that you're feeling?

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:28.434 align:middle line:90%
What did that activate in you?

00:24:28.434 --> 00:24:30.836 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And when
we measure it,

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:34.006 align:middle line:84%
it takes five-- well, when we
were doing it with oxytocin,

00:24:34.006 --> 00:24:36.375 align:middle line:90%
we waited 30 minutes.

00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:90%
You want to get good response.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.279 align:middle line:84%
And we've done the same
thing with the Ring of Fire,

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:42.181 align:middle line:90%
20 to 30 minutes.

00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:45.884 align:middle line:90%
You've gotten a good increase.

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:47.786 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, so that
one is specifically

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:49.388 align:middle line:90%
for pain and depression.

00:24:49.388 --> 00:24:50.456 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: And depression.

00:24:50.456 --> 00:24:53.125 align:middle line:84%
We've got hundreds
of people now who

00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:56.195 align:middle line:84%
are telling me that it's
taken care of their depression

00:24:56.195 --> 00:24:57.663 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in years.

00:24:57.663 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.765 align:middle line:84%
Because depression
is definitely--

00:24:59.765 --> 00:25:01.433 align:middle line:84%
in your experience,
is it on the rise?

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:02.201 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, yeah.

00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:84%
40% of Americans are
clinically depressed.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.671 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 40%?

00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:06.472 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: 40%.

00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:07.673 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's almost
half of the people.

00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:09.308 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Another
40% have what I

00:25:09.308 --> 00:25:12.811 align:middle line:84%
call a sub-clinical
depressive miasma.

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:14.813 align:middle line:84%
They're about that
far from depression.

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:16.281 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do they know?

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Most of
them aren't aware.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:18.851 align:middle line:90%
They're just not happy.

00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:19.351 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.652 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:23.222 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And so all
of them can benefit

00:25:23.222 --> 00:25:24.256 align:middle line:90%
from something like this.

00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:26.592 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you know what's
causing that, overall?

00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:27.359 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, yeah.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.495 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
it's poor self-esteem.

00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It started not later than
five or six years of age.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:41.907 align:middle line:84%
It all begins with how you
bond with your parents,

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:43.275 align:middle line:90%
to be truthful.

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So we now know that
oxytocin deficiency

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:54.987 align:middle line:84%
is rampant and present in
autism, ADHD, depression,

00:25:54.987 --> 00:26:00.459 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, addiction, and
schizophrenia, among others.

00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, so that makes sense.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.162 align:middle line:90%
That absolutely makes sense.

00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:05.764 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are different
ways that you can really

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:09.735 align:middle line:84%
start to experience this
and use these natural ways

00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:14.406 align:middle line:84%
of stimulating hormones,
oxytocin, DHEA that work

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.608 align:middle line:84%
and have worked for years
in your clinical practice.

00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:16.909 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:19.211 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we aren't
going into it right now,

00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:22.247 align:middle line:84%
but the Ring of Crystal lowers
free radical production.

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:25.951 align:middle line:84%
Free radicals are the things
that ultimately kill your cells

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:90%
and age you, too.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.089 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's a
whole anti-aging aspect

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:31.857 align:middle line:90%
to this is as well.

00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:32.758 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Absolutely.

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.761 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] You've pretty
much touched on everything.

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:39.031 align:middle line:84%
So I want to hear from you
also via Facebook and Twitter.

00:26:39.031 --> 00:26:42.267 align:middle line:84%
If you had a type of pain that
you would want to get rid of

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:90%
or to heal, what would that be?

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.804 align:middle line:90%
So let us know.

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:47.506 align:middle line:90%
And we can find out.

00:26:47.506 --> 00:26:49.374 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one of the things
that we could work on

00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:50.142 align:middle line:90%
in the next break.

00:26:50.142 --> 00:26:52.644 align:middle line:84%
We'll take a poll and see
what the main source of pain

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:54.513 align:middle line:90%
is that people have out there.

00:26:54.513 --> 00:26:57.516 align:middle line:90%
And then get rid of it.

00:26:57.516 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Banish it.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:58.951 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:00.118 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good thing.

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:00.886 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:27:00.886 --> 00:27:02.788 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Norm Shealy is my guest.

00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And you have an amazing
amount of information.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.026 align:middle line:84%
So when we come
back, we'll be going

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:09.962 align:middle line:84%
through some of these
points on your body.

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:12.731 align:middle line:84%
So don't forget to get through
us to Facebook and Twitter.

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:13.565 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:15.934 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Welcome back.

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:16.802 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.539 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is
Dr. Norm Shealy,

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:23.175 align:middle line:84%
neurosurgeon and creator
of the original TENS

00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:25.077 align:middle line:84%
unit for pain control
and management.

00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:27.312 align:middle line:84%
So far what we've talked
about is that there are many,

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:30.382 align:middle line:84%
many ways and technologies
to be able to reduce

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:32.484 align:middle line:90%
and quite often eliminate pain.

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.753 align:middle line:84%
We just went through a
series of tapping exercises.

00:27:34.753 --> 00:27:36.255 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
through a few more

00:27:36.255 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
that you'll get to
do along with us.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.425 align:middle line:84%
But I asked before the break,
what are some of the things

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:42.794 align:middle line:84%
that you are
experiencing that you

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:44.796 align:middle line:84%
would like to get rid
of in terms of pain?

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:47.199 align:middle line:84%
And we've heard so far
from Bill on Facebook

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:84%
is suffering from back pain,
that Sarah is basically

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:56.008 align:middle line:84%
saying she's having trouble
sleeping, that a lot of people

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:57.609 align:middle line:84%
were experiencing
the other rings.

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:01.413 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the Facebook
responses right now.

00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:04.049 align:middle line:84%
And they had a lot
of great experience

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:05.217 align:middle line:90%
from what we just did.

00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:07.019 align:middle line:84%
So it's working, which
is really good news.

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:10.689 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are feeling
very happy and very at ease.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.424 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing.

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:13.992 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Yes, well,
for Bill, I would

00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:17.596 align:middle line:84%
say the most important
thing is magnesium.

00:28:17.596 --> 00:28:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Because 80% of people are
deficient in magnesium.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.969 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
enough magnesium,

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
the muscles go into spasm,
the cells get hyperactive.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.008 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why are we so
deficient in magnesium?

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:31.643 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Because
it's not in our soil.

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:33.812 align:middle line:84%
Cattle farmers know
that if they do not

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:37.082 align:middle line:84%
give their cattle
actual extra magnesium,

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:40.919 align:middle line:90%
they die of gas staggers.

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:44.623 align:middle line:84%
And so people will break
down in their weakest spot.

00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:47.593 align:middle line:84%
So muscle pain
especially is very

00:28:47.593 --> 00:28:50.495 align:middle line:84%
common in people who are
deficient in magnesium.

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.831 align:middle line:84%
The best way to get it
is through the skin.

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:55.601 align:middle line:84%
Magnesium chloride is
absorbed 10 to 20 times

00:28:55.601 --> 00:28:58.503 align:middle line:84%
better through the
skin than it is orally.

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:00.138 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So magnesium lotions.

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:02.574 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Yeah, the lotion
is much better than the oral.

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:07.179 align:middle line:84%
Now in addition to that,
I strongly recommend yoga.

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:09.748 align:middle line:84%
It's a fabulous
technique for back pain.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:13.986 align:middle line:84%
There's a tool-- I'm sure
if he's a gym person that he

00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:90%
knows about the Roman chair.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.958 align:middle line:84%
It's a thing, the pelvis
rests on this and you do this.

00:29:19.958 --> 00:29:23.128 align:middle line:84%
And this stretches the
muscles, relaxes the spine,

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
but also strengthens
the paraspinal muscles.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.064 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At the same time?

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:26.565 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:26.565 --> 00:29:29.901 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And of course
if that doesn't work,

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
obviously the TENS
device locally

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.939 align:middle line:90%
around the area of pain.

00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:35.507 align:middle line:84%
And if that doesn't
work, then I'd

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:40.278 align:middle line:84%
go to the Ring of Earth,
which is another of the rings.

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:43.582 align:middle line:84%
It raises calcitonin-- 40 to 60
times as powerful as morphine.

00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:44.516 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, all right.

00:29:44.516 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that one.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.119 align:middle line:84%
Because that one--
yeah, a lot of people--

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:50.422 align:middle line:84%

00:30:00.499 --> 00:30:02.734 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Then you go
outside the ankle bones,

behind the ankle
bone on the outside.

00:30:05.437 --> 00:30:06.872 align:middle line:90%
That's Bladder 60.

00:30:07.773 --> 00:30:09.708 align:middle line:84%

00:30:54.286 --> 00:30:56.822 align:middle line:84%
But here I don't tap, because
you're over the carotid artery.

00:30:56.822 --> 00:30:59.591 align:middle line:84%
I just take the skin and
pinch it hard, twist.

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:25.817 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Calcitonin.

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:26.318 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:32.023 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Calcitonin helps you
put calcium into your bones.

00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:34.493 align:middle line:84%
So it prevents and
treats osteoporosis.

00:31:34.493 --> 00:31:36.628 align:middle line:84%
But also, because
calcitonin itself

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:40.065 align:middle line:84%
is a pain reliever, 40 to 60
times as powerful as morphine,

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:41.533 align:middle line:84%
it's phenomenal
for general pain.

00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:42.567 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For general pain.

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:44.236 align:middle line:84%
So that's a great
one for general pain.

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:44.736 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:45.537 align:middle line:90%
That's terrific.

00:31:45.537 --> 00:31:48.039 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand that you're
in the middle of a big research

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.141 align:middle line:90%
project on back pain.

00:31:49.141 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: As a matter
of fact, I am doing one.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.912 align:middle line:84%
There's a company
called Life Wave,

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:56.982 align:middle line:84%
and they make
acupuncture patches.

00:31:56.982 --> 00:31:59.417 align:middle line:84%
And they're homeopathic
patches that

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:03.488 align:middle line:84%
feed back the infrared
heat coming off the body

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:06.124 align:middle line:90%
and heat the acupuncture points.

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:06.858 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:07.626 align:middle line:90%
That's good news.

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:09.294 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, they used
moxibustion over there.

00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:10.362 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:32:10.362 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But these
work really well.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.799 align:middle line:84%
I've done several
studies on these patches

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
for different things,
like for insomnia.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.302 align:middle line:90%
The person had trouble sleeping.

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:19.404 align:middle line:84%
There's one called
Silent Nights.

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:21.706 align:middle line:84%
We got, even ina
double blind placebo

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:25.277 align:middle line:84%
crossover study, 80%
increase in length of sleep.

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:26.278 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are kidding.

00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:27.546 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: There's no
drug in the world that

00:32:27.546 --> 00:32:28.513 align:middle line:90%
can come close to that.

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.482 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That could really
help a lot of people.

00:32:30.482 --> 00:32:32.017 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: A lot of people.

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:33.151 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:36.054 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically
these points right here.

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:37.522 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well,
actually, it's only

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:41.092 align:middle line:84%
on the right when you're
using the Silent Nights.

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:45.697 align:middle line:84%
Right here, right here,
right here, here, or here.

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:47.999 align:middle line:84%
You play with one of
those five points.

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:50.235 align:middle line:84%
Most people find one of
them that's really good.

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:51.636 align:middle line:84%
And some people
all of them work.

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:52.737 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have an amazing
amount of knowledge.

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:55.073 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And that's just
one patch in that case.

00:32:55.073 --> 00:32:59.177 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the pain patches,
which is ice wave,

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:01.680 align:middle line:84%
it takes two and
sometimes three.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.416 align:middle line:84%
You put one in the
center of the pain,

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:09.754 align:middle line:84%
and then you sort of move around
to find the energetic flow.

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:12.858 align:middle line:84%
But we're getting
remarkably good results.

00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:17.128 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our farm foreman had
shoulder surgery seven times

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:22.234 align:middle line:84%
before he ever came to work
for me, terrible shoulder pain.

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:26.204 align:middle line:84%
I put the patches on him
July a year and a half ago.

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:29.374 align:middle line:84%
Within less than three
minutes, his pain was gone.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:30.275 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:30.775 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:31.776 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: After 20 years.

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:32.878 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: After that
many surgeries.

00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:33.044 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:34.913 align:middle line:84%
We're getting a lot of

00:33:34.913 --> 00:33:36.448 align:middle line:90%
Shealy via Facebook.

00:33:36.448 --> 00:33:38.516 align:middle line:84%
Can you tap to boost

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:40.252 align:middle line:84%
Great question from
Tonya on Facebook.

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:43.054 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, there of
course, you're wanting primarily

00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:45.991 align:middle line:84%
to reduce stress and
optimize thyroid function.

00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:47.459 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so back
to the thyroid.

00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:49.527 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: So there I would
use the Ring of Fire.

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:51.129 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
thyroid is largely

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:52.664 align:middle line:90%
misdiagnosed in this country?

00:33:52.664 --> 00:33:53.465 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, yeah.

00:33:53.465 --> 00:33:55.166 align:middle line:84%
I think there are a
huge number of people

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:58.069 align:middle line:90%
who have mild hypothyroidism.

00:33:58.069 --> 00:34:00.639 align:middle line:84%
Because, just as with
iodine, we're deficient.

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:03.074 align:middle line:84%
Just as with magnesium,
we're deficient in iodine.

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:05.477 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And some of the symptoms of
that are low energy, fatigue.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.982 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Elevated cholesterol.

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:13.451 align:middle line:84%
Both high and low
blood pressure,

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:16.454 align:middle line:84%
interestingly, weight
gain, of course.

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:20.324 align:middle line:84%
And I did a study on this
15 years or more ago,

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:23.695 align:middle line:84%
and we found everybody
was deficient in iodine--

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:25.931 align:middle line:84%
in blood tests, urine
tests, that sort of thing.

00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:28.833 align:middle line:84%
So iodine itself
will help stimulate

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:30.768 align:middle line:90%
the thyroid in some people.

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:33.438 align:middle line:84%
And if that doesn't work, then
we add to it the Ring of Fire.

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.072 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard that people
with Hashimoto's, though,

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:35.907 align:middle line:90%
should not use that.

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:36.841 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's right.

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:39.143 align:middle line:84%
With Hashimoto's, that's
an autoimmune disease.

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:40.946 align:middle line:84%
But you can certainly
use the Ring of Fire.

00:34:40.946 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:84%
And there, I would also
use castor oil packs

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:44.916 align:middle line:90%
over the thyroid.

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:47.217 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The old castor
oil pack technique.

00:34:47.217 --> 00:34:48.954 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Old castor oil pack.

00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:54.859 align:middle line:90%
It is a local increase in detox.

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:55.726 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:57.963 align:middle line:84%
So it pulls the toxins
out of the thyroid.

00:34:57.963 --> 00:34:59.731 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Lymph, yeah,
and into the lymph,

00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:01.066 align:middle line:84%
back into the

00:35:01.066 --> 00:35:02.934 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Linda from

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:07.472 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: If you're
doing it for self-esteem,

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:11.409 align:middle line:90%
I would do the Ring of Air.

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.445 align:middle line:90%
And the reason for that is--

00:35:13.445 --> 00:35:15.246 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's which one?

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:16.748 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: The Ring
of Air is the one

00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:19.451 align:middle line:84%
that raises neurotensin

00:35:19.451 --> 00:35:23.121 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one
where-- raising oxytocin

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.557 align:middle line:84%
is what's important
for self-esteem.

00:35:25.557 --> 00:35:27.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's makes
a lot of sense.

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:28.126 align:middle line:90%
It's about connection.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.805 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Here, base of
the skull, top center.

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:42.607 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Once again,
you can see all of this

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:44.676 align:middle line:90%
if you just go to GaiamTV.com.

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:46.444 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to see
the replay of this.

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:48.813 align:middle line:84%
So we're covering a
lot of information.

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:52.584 align:middle line:84%
So one of the listeners
as well from Twitter

00:35:52.584 --> 00:35:57.589 align:middle line:84%
is saying that this person had
a pinched nerve and headache.

00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, that
suggests something

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.925 align:middle line:90%
in the cervical spine.

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:03.228 align:middle line:84%
Now, depending upon
what's going on,

00:36:03.228 --> 00:36:06.431 align:middle line:84%
I mean if it truly is a pinched
nerve, it may need surgery.

00:36:06.431 --> 00:36:10.001 align:middle line:84%
There is a place,
still, for surgery.

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:13.071 align:middle line:84%
I'd want a very
competent neurosurgeon

00:36:13.071 --> 00:36:16.141 align:middle line:84%
if it was a spinal
problem, myself.

00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:20.845 align:middle line:84%
But gentle stuff--
there's a very simple tool

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:24.449 align:middle line:84%
I did two research projects
on called Posture Pump.

00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:27.519 align:middle line:84%
It puts a little thing
that helps extend the neck

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:30.722 align:middle line:84%
and stretch the
spine-- extremely safe.

00:36:30.722 --> 00:36:32.323 align:middle line:84%
And that can help
a lot of people

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:35.026 align:middle line:90%
with headache and neck pain.

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.195 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In your practice,
in your clinical practice,

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:39.864 align:middle line:84%
what is the biggest
complaint that you hear?

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:40.732 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Depression.

00:36:40.732 --> 00:36:42.567 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Depression is
the biggest complaint.

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.334 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Anxiety.

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:46.738 align:middle line:84%
People don't complain about it
as much, but it's part of it.

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:50.675 align:middle line:84%
And then some kind of pain,
but back pain is most common.

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:53.945 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And these are
alternatives to talk therapy.

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:54.813 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Well, yeah.

00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:58.583 align:middle line:84%
I have to admit I have a
Ph.D. in psychology, too.

00:36:58.583 --> 00:36:59.451 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's right.

00:36:59.451 --> 00:36:59.984 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:03.421 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But I think talk
therapy is for the birds,

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:04.689 align:middle line:90%
not for people.

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:05.523 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:06.958 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: I don't
think much of it.

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.426 align:middle line:90%
It takes forever.

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:11.229 align:middle line:90%
You'd do a lot more with EFT.

00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:12.897 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I have
heard that, yes.

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:14.999 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
to do-- that has

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:18.403 align:middle line:84%
to be said for communicating
and talking about your problems.

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: For some people, yeah.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.272 align:middle line:84%
As Edgar Cayce said, if you
have this kind of personality,

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:21.940 align:middle line:90%
you do that.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:27.112 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not impressed that
conventional, traditional talk

00:37:27.112 --> 00:37:31.249 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy is nearly as
good as tap psychotherapy.

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:31.749 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.751 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the tapping points

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:35.086 align:middle line:90%
and the tapping meridians that--

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.721 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Well--

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:38.223 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is for what?

00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:40.925 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, this is for
any kind of emotional state.

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:41.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.629 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Repeat what you
want to do, what you're after.

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Tap here, tap here,
tap here, tap here.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.301 align:middle line:90%
And then there are some others.

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:51.402 align:middle line:90%
But those are the big ones.

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:53.271 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: For depression?

00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:54.139 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Oh, yeah.

00:37:54.139 --> 00:37:56.941 align:middle line:90%
Or anxiety.

00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.044 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole chapter on this
in my book "Energy Medicine."

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:02.747 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, which you
are one of the pioneers of.

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.549 align:middle line:84%
And so these are the
points in the body that

00:38:04.549 --> 00:38:08.019 align:middle line:84%
stimulate the meridians that
release anxiety and depression.

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:08.686 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Right.

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:09.888 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Again, going back to
your Facebook questions,

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.593 align:middle line:84%
so Mel from New York
is saying what can he

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:17.762 align:middle line:90%
do for stomach pain?

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:19.631 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well
obviously, you always

00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:22.500 align:middle line:84%
want to have a physician
make a diagnosis.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.402 align:middle line:84%
Stomach pain, I'd
want to know why.

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:27.005 align:middle line:84%
You need to see a
physician and find out

00:38:27.005 --> 00:38:28.973 align:middle line:84%
whether you have a peptic
ulcer, for instance,

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:30.074 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:32.477 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a broad-- yeah.

00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:34.779 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And of course,
you could castor oil packs

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:35.513 align:middle line:90%
over the pain.

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:37.448 align:middle line:84%
It's good for all kinds
of abdominal pain.

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:38.983 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:41.819 align:middle line:84%
Deep relax-- autogenic
training would be superb.

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:42.954 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Autogenic training.

00:38:42.954 --> 00:38:44.589 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, J. H. Shultz,
Johan H. Shultz, back in 1912

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.428 align:middle line:84%
started research
on this technique

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.730 align:middle line:90%
called autogenic training.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.165 align:middle line:90%
Wrote his first book in 1932.

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:57.368 align:middle line:84%
By 1969, he begin the
first of six volumes

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:01.039 align:middle line:84%
on autogenic training with
2,600 scientific references.

00:39:01.039 --> 00:39:07.145 align:middle line:84%
Autogenic training will
bring 80% of stress illnesses

00:39:07.145 --> 00:39:08.346 align:middle line:90%
under control.

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:09.447 align:middle line:90%
But you've got to do it.

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:10.248 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is it?

00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:15.253 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It takes 18 minutes,
ideally, to do it well.

00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:16.487 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:21.159 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: My arms and
legs are heavy and warm.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:22.794 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
a guided imagery?

00:39:22.794 --> 00:39:26.164 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: A guided
imagery, words and imagery,

00:39:26.164 --> 00:39:28.233 align:middle line:90%
to create what you want.

00:39:28.233 --> 00:39:31.936 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so that combination
of the words and imagery

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.938 align:middle line:84%
basically move the body
just like the meridians.

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:35.306 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:39:35.306 --> 00:39:36.874 align:middle line:90%
And it changes the physiology.

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:39.477 align:middle line:84%
It changes the electricity
in the brain itself.

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:41.913 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you say there's
research studies around this,

00:39:41.913 --> 00:39:44.015 align:middle line:84%
what did the research
studies show?

00:39:44.015 --> 00:39:48.119 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: 80% of
students do better.

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.888 align:middle line:90%
80% of athletes do better.

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:55.026 align:middle line:84%
80% of people with stress
illnesses, like peptic ulcer,

00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:58.930 align:middle line:84%
do better, and high blood
pressure, et cetera.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:03.201 align:middle line:84%
It quiets the stress
response and allows the body

00:40:03.201 --> 00:40:04.769 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself.

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:08.973 align:middle line:84%
There's actually more published
research around this one tool

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:11.509 align:middle line:84%
than almost all of
the others combined.

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:12.277 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:40:12.277 --> 00:40:14.345 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: And it
is a fabulous tool.

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:16.447 align:middle line:90%
The problem is it takes time.

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:21.386 align:middle line:84%
It's that we're back to that
15 to 20 minute business

00:40:21.386 --> 00:40:23.588 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of
people will not do.

00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:25.456 align:middle line:90%
But it is one of my favorites.

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:27.825 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So people would
rather stay in pain

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:30.361 align:middle line:84%
rather than spend 18
minutes on an exercise?

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.462 align:middle line:90%
Are you really saying that?

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:32.864 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: I am saying that.

00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:33.931 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:35.466 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what way?

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:36.734 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: People won't do it.

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:39.404 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget this one man.

00:40:39.404 --> 00:40:41.105 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, doc, I'll do that.

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:41.973 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Didn't do it.

00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:44.509 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Three months
later, I can't do that, doc.

00:40:44.509 --> 00:40:45.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.678 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it embarrassment?

00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:47.445 align:middle line:90%
Is it-- why?

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:50.682 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: It's just they
are not willing to focus

00:40:50.682 --> 00:40:54.152 align:middle line:90%
their attention on detaching.

00:40:54.152 --> 00:40:56.521 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if it's because
they don't think it'll work?

00:40:56.521 --> 00:40:58.756 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, obviously
that's always part of it.

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.491 align:middle line:90%
It's not a drug.

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:01.926 align:middle line:90%
I have to do it.

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:03.361 align:middle line:90%
You think it's all in my head.

00:41:03.361 --> 00:41:06.464 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] There's not
enough commercials around it.

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:07.432 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's right.

00:41:07.432 --> 00:41:09.334 align:middle line:84%
No side effects,
however, no publications.

00:41:09.334 --> 00:41:11.602 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's not enough
people walking on the beach

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:13.604 align:middle line:84%
saying we're going to be
great if you tap and do

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:14.706 align:middle line:90%
this autogenic training.

00:41:14.706 --> 00:41:15.707 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: You've got it.

00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:17.075 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:41:17.075 --> 00:41:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lack of hype
that doesn't give people

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.678 align:middle line:90%
the belief that they need--

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.046 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:24.849 align:middle line:90%
And I do this every day.

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:27.485 align:middle line:84%
I personally do
autogenic training

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:30.621 align:middle line:84%
and have since 1972,
every day of my life.

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well I want to
actually give you guys

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.292 align:middle line:84%
the experience of the
autogenic training,

00:41:34.292 --> 00:41:39.163 align:middle line:84%
but I want to get to a
few more questions here.

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:42.567 align:middle line:84%
Terry on Facebook is feeling
very stressed, especially

00:41:42.567 --> 00:41:43.334 align:middle line:90%
from the holidays.

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:46.771 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
post-holiday stress,

00:41:46.771 --> 00:41:48.172 align:middle line:84%
especially before
going to sleep,

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:50.675 align:middle line:84%
particularly people that lost
loved ones around the holidays

00:41:50.675 --> 00:41:51.776 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:53.711 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: That is always
difficult, believe me.

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, interestingly,
Bliss applied at bedtime

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.221 align:middle line:84%
to the Ring of Air points is
phenomenal for deep sleep.

00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:06.791 align:middle line:84%
But doing the Ring of
Air will quiet the system

00:42:06.791 --> 00:42:08.059 align:middle line:90%
with the tapping.

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:09.627 align:middle line:84%
And of course
autogenic training,

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:11.963 align:middle line:84%
you could put yourself to
sleep with autogenic training.

00:42:11.963 --> 00:42:13.531 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's the
self-talk that we're

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:14.899 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
in just a second.

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:15.333 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Exactly.

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.171 align:middle line:84%
So we want to actually
do a little demonstration

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:22.006 align:middle line:84%
of what the autogenic
training is.

00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:23.541 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
take us through it.

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:26.844 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to listen
at home and just listen

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:30.248 align:middle line:84%
to what Dr. Shealy is saying
and how this registers with you

00:42:30.248 --> 00:42:32.150 align:middle line:90%
and what your experience is.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.987 align:middle line:84%
And please communicate back
with us on Facebook and Twitter

00:42:35.987 --> 00:42:38.589 align:middle line:84%
so I can read some of
your responses on the air.

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:41.426 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: So make yourself
comfortable, physically as

00:42:41.426 --> 00:42:43.027 align:middle line:90%
comfortably as you can.

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.629 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:46.164 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:42:46.164 --> 00:42:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.702 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe
in, say to yourself,

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:55.640 align:middle line:84%
my arms and legs--
as you breathe out--

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:90%
are heavy and warm.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:05.116 align:middle line:84%
My arms and legs
are heavy and warm.

00:43:05.116 --> 00:43:07.685 align:middle line:84%
As you say the words,
create an image

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:11.789 align:middle line:84%
of the sun beaming down
upon your arms and legs,

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:15.726 align:middle line:84%
warming them pleasantly
through and through.

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:21.332 align:middle line:84%
My arms and legs
are heavy and warm,

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:27.104 align:middle line:84%
words and images
create feelings.

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:34.345 align:middle line:84%
My arms and legs
are heavy and warm.

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:38.483 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe
in-- my heartbeat--

00:43:38.483 --> 00:43:45.556 align:middle line:84%
as you breathe out--
is calm and regular.

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:50.728 align:middle line:84%
My heartbeat is
calm and regular.

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:53.197 align:middle line:84%
Create a picture of
something calm and regular,

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:57.668 align:middle line:84%
like a metronome or the
pendulum of a clock.

00:43:57.668 --> 00:44:03.574 align:middle line:84%
My heartbeat is
calm and regular.

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:08.579 align:middle line:84%
My heartbeat is
calm and regular.

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:11.282 align:middle line:84%
The first time you
practice this, the blood

00:44:11.282 --> 00:44:14.185 align:middle line:90%
pressure and pulse decrease 10%.

00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:22.059 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: My breathing
is free and easy.

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:28.099 align:middle line:90%
My breathing is free and easy.

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:31.569 align:middle line:84%
I like the image of a bird
gliding through the air

00:44:31.569 --> 00:44:33.971 align:middle line:84%
without having to
beat its wings.

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:37.074 align:middle line:84%
But any image that
feels right is fine.

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:41.512 align:middle line:90%
My breathing is free and easy.

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:45.483 align:middle line:90%
Feel how easy, automatic.

00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:50.421 align:middle line:90%
My breathing is free and easy.

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:58.162 align:middle line:90%
My abdomen is warm.

00:44:58.162 --> 00:45:01.465 align:middle line:90%
My abdomen is warm.

00:45:01.465 --> 00:45:04.201 align:middle line:84%
And here, imagine
the sun beaming

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:08.539 align:middle line:84%
down up on your abdomen,
warming it through and through.

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:13.210 align:middle line:90%
My abdomen is warm.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:16.480 align:middle line:90%
My abdomen is warm.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.652 align:middle line:90%
My forehead is cool.

00:45:24.155 --> 00:45:28.059 align:middle line:90%
My forehead is cool.

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:31.495 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you're outside,
warmly dressed,

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:35.433 align:middle line:84%
but a pleasant, cool breeze is
blowing across your forehead.

00:45:35.433 --> 00:45:38.069 align:middle line:84%
Because the blood,
when you relax,

00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:41.872 align:middle line:84%
goes back to your hands and body
rather than into your brain.

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:90%
My forehead is cool.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:50.548 align:middle line:90%
My forehead it's cool.

00:45:50.548 --> 00:45:56.187 align:middle line:90%
My mind is quiet and still.

00:45:56.187 --> 00:46:02.026 align:middle line:90%
My mind is quiet and still.

00:46:02.026 --> 00:46:08.733 align:middle line:84%
Create an image of something
pleasantly quiet and still.

00:46:08.733 --> 00:46:13.237 align:middle line:84%
Sense, see, feel, convert
those words and images

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:15.306 align:middle line:90%
into experience.

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:20.311 align:middle line:90%
My mind is quiet and still.

00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:23.748 align:middle line:84%
Now even that brief one
will begin the process.

00:46:23.748 --> 00:46:26.217 align:middle line:84%
And you can extend the
number of repetitions longer.

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:27.685 align:middle line:84%
Then when you reach
that stage, you

00:46:27.685 --> 00:46:31.255 align:middle line:84%
can sort of go through the
body and feel any area that's

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:35.126 align:middle line:84%
still out of balance, whether
you've got discomfort, anything

00:46:35.126 --> 00:46:36.227 align:middle line:90%
that's just not right.

00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:37.595 align:middle line:90%
Talk to that part.

00:46:37.595 --> 00:46:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Like Dr. Dolittle,
talk to the animals.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.631 align:middle line:90%
Talk to the body.

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:41.699 align:middle line:90%
My back--

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:43.267 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just
going to say, yeah.

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.869 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: --is comfortable.

00:46:44.869 --> 00:46:47.805 align:middle line:90%
My back is comfortable.

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:51.208 align:middle line:84%
Create an image of yourself
being totally relaxed

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:53.744 align:middle line:84%
and smiling because
of your back.

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:55.246 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
that little voice

00:46:55.246 --> 00:46:57.682 align:middle line:84%
that comes up in your head
saying no, my back is in pain.

00:46:57.682 --> 00:46:58.983 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with that voice?

00:46:58.983 --> 00:47:04.789 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: OK, it's like
"don't chase white bears."

00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:08.192 align:middle line:84%
They don't exist very often
except at the North Pole.

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:10.795 align:middle line:84%
If you're sitting and
meditating on top of a mountain

00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:12.563 align:middle line:84%
and a train goes
down in the valley,

00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:14.765 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to jump on
the train and go with it.

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have to train yourself to
detach from those thoughts that

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:21.572 align:middle line:90%
don't belong where you are.

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.474 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
whole training,

00:47:23.474 --> 00:47:25.342 align:middle line:84%
is to keep your
attention focused

00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:28.813 align:middle line:84%
on what you're
wanting to create.

00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:29.346 align:middle line:90%
So it's OK.

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.281 align:middle line:90%
Don't get annoyed.

00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:31.582 align:middle line:90%
Just start over.

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:34.018 align:middle line:84%
My arms and legs
are heavy and warm.

00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:35.352 align:middle line:90%
My heartbeat's calm and regular.

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:37.755 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if your mind
starts to get distracted--

00:47:37.755 --> 00:47:38.055 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's OK.

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:38.889 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Start again.

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.424 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Just come
right back to it.

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:43.527 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And why is the
emphasis on the warmth?

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:45.229 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well,
actually, because Shultz

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:48.399 align:middle line:84%
found that when people were
put into a hypnotic trance,

00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:51.669 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that happens
is the hands become warm.

00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:54.572 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin
to feel heavy,

00:47:54.572 --> 00:47:57.074 align:middle line:84%
the way as if you're
going to drift

00:47:57.074 --> 00:48:00.444 align:middle line:84%
into the mattress, that heavy
feeling of deep relaxation.

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing they feel

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.217 align:middle line:90%
is calming of the heartbeat.

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:08.152 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:48:08.152 --> 00:48:11.155 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is amazing to do
if you're in a work environment

00:48:11.155 --> 00:48:12.323 align:middle line:90%
and it's stressful.

00:48:12.323 --> 00:48:16.894 align:middle line:84%
Or I've heard that women's
stress hormones raise

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:19.897 align:middle line:84%
when they come home from work,
because there's more work

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.198 align:middle line:90%
to do when you get home.

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:22.600 align:middle line:90%
As opposed to men, whose drop.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is a great
opportunity for women to--

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:31.709 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Once you've
done this for a few weeks,

00:48:31.709 --> 00:48:35.613 align:middle line:84%
then you may only have to repeat
each phrase a couple times

00:48:35.613 --> 00:48:37.314 align:middle line:90%
to get a quick experience.

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, can it also be
used for peak performance?

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.418 align:middle line:84%
You said that athletes
use this before--

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:42.386 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: That's right.

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:44.722 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I worked
with a football team

00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:48.425 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Wisconsin
La Crosse back in the '70s.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.528 align:middle line:84%
They had been the
bottom of their league.

00:48:50.528 --> 00:48:52.229 align:middle line:90%
They were not good.

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:54.999 align:middle line:84%
I gave them just six
sessions in guided imagery

00:48:54.999 --> 00:48:57.168 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of
stuff for what to do,

00:48:57.168 --> 00:48:58.936 align:middle line:90%
and they were co-champions.

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.738 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See, this is
what I love about this

00:49:00.738 --> 00:49:02.940 align:middle line:84%
is that it's something
that you can do at home.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.643 align:middle line:84%
You can do, whatever
your situation.

00:49:05.643 --> 00:49:07.678 align:middle line:84%
And it's extremely
cost effective.

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:09.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's all about awareness.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.981 align:middle line:84%
It's about flipping
the switch of what

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:14.485 align:middle line:84%
it is that your options are and
your choices are around pain,

00:49:14.485 --> 00:49:17.721 align:middle line:84%
depression, and various--
not only techniques

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.857 align:middle line:84%
and technologies out
there, but there's things

00:49:19.857 --> 00:49:22.626 align:middle line:84%
that you can have in
your mental toolkit.

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:27.665 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Again, at least
85% of all illnesses

00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:28.866 align:middle line:90%
are stress illnesses.

00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:29.366 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:30.701 align:middle line:90%
I've heard higher.

>>SHEALY: Well, about 15%--

00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:33.571 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you're
the physician, so--

00:49:33.571 --> 00:49:37.675 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, you
know, some things happen

00:49:37.675 --> 00:49:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and you can't pin them down.

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.611 align:middle line:90%
And they're more serious.

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:41.946 align:middle line:90%
And they need drugs or surgery.

00:49:41.946 --> 00:49:43.113 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:47.751 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: But the 85% are the
ones that can be recovering

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:51.922 align:middle line:84%
and totally cured
without drugs or surgery.

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:54.825 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Some of those--
yes, exactly, the, quote,

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:57.461 align:middle line:84%
incurables where you can
actually make a difference.

00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:59.897 align:middle line:84%
And it's also empowering
because you're doing something,

00:49:59.897 --> 00:50:01.665 align:middle line:84%
rather than getting
a life sentence

00:50:01.665 --> 00:50:03.334 align:middle line:84%
saying there's nothing
that can be done.

00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:04.301 align:middle line:90%
That's not empowering.

00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Well, as a matter
of fact, the vast majority

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:10.574 align:middle line:84%
of pains that I saw for 30 years
were people who had been told,

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:12.409 align:middle line:84%
you've got to learn
to live with it.

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:13.878 align:middle line:84%
People don't learn
to live with it.

00:50:13.878 --> 00:50:14.979 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, exactly.

00:50:14.979 --> 00:50:19.183 align:middle line:84%
One of our Facebook questions
is, is this OK while driving?

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:20.084 align:middle line:90%
Paul wants to know.

00:50:20.084 --> 00:50:21.085 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Ah!

00:50:21.085 --> 00:50:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In heavy rush
hour traffic, he asks.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.721 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: No, no.

00:50:23.721 --> 00:50:25.723 align:middle line:84%
All you can do when
you're doing-- you've

00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:27.057 align:middle line:90%
got to pay attention.

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But you can just
slowly deep breathe.

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.361 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:30.361 --> 00:50:32.162 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Don't do
any visualization

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:33.364 align:middle line:90%
other than watching the road.

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:33.998 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:50:33.998 --> 00:50:35.766 align:middle line:84%
What about Frances,
who is feeling

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.101 align:middle line:90%
an asthma attack coming on?

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:37.735 align:middle line:90%
Will this help?

00:50:37.735 --> 00:50:41.538 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Now, asthma is
one of those things where

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:45.876 align:middle line:84%
the autonomic nervous system
is really out of balance.

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:48.178 align:middle line:84%
And if I were
working with her, I

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:53.751 align:middle line:84%
would have her start with all
the phrases except breathing.

00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:57.288 align:middle line:84%
Do all the other five phrases
first for a couple of weeks,

00:50:57.288 --> 00:51:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and then add the
breathing component.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.459 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that she can work
with the breathing later.

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEALY: Yes.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.627 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:04.128 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:51:04.128 --> 00:51:05.729 align:middle line:84%
So relax the body
first and then--

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.264 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEALY: Relax the
body and the mind

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.499 align:middle line:90%
and the heart and everything.

00:51:08.499 --> 00:51:11.235 align:middle line:84%
And then the body's
gotten accustomed to it,

00:51:11.235 --> 00:51:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and then you can start
talking to the breathing.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:14.438 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're amazing.

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:17.474 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for all of your options

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:19.143 align:middle line:84%
that you've brought
us and the awareness

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:20.411 align:middle line:90%
that you've brought with us.
