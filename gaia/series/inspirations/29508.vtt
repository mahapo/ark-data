[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to have
caught up with Manjir again.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
I've known you for
a few years now.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:10%
And first introduced-- you
were first introduced to me

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:10%
by your book "Punk Science,"
which is a really interesting

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:10%
view of black hole theory.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:10%
Because it's not this thing that
gobbles up light and life never

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:10%
to have it emerge again,
but rather something

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:10%
that's a creative force.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into that
as part of "The Genius Groove,"

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:90%
your new book, which I love.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so
intriguing to people

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
because everybody is looking
for their genius groove,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:90%
on one level or another.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
how to find it.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.945 align:middle line:84%
So let's start more toward the
beginning of this story as us

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:84%
as little, wee ones.
-Yeah.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people-- well,
everybody starts out

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:10%
with more of a clear
idea of who they

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:10%
are, what they want in life.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, as a medical doctor,
I would ask people, what

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:10%
did you want to do as a child?

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, they would
shift into a different space.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it was more--
it was tuning into more

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of the deepest
aspects of themselves,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
even if it was a train driver
or something like that.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.045 align:middle line:90%
So we do go into education.

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us go into some
sort of state education.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to be really
beaten out of us, you know.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Not literally, but
often [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:84%
People start to realize
that as a little kid,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:90%
you're nice and free.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And everything is self-directed.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:10%
And then we start to tell
people, tell our children

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:10%
that everything about their
value is outside of themselves

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:10%
and the correct
answer is something

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:10%
that is outside of them.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's a paradigm
that we learn early on.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:10%
And that really sticks with us
to the point when we get to-- I

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:10%
think kids get to
about 11 to 15,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.565 align:middle line:10%
they're no longer
as imaginative.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at-- and you
know studies have shown this.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
They're not able to think of
as many different responses

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:90%
and creative ideas.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So really, we're seeing
this process going on.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the schooling is
actually responsible for that.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not only the
schooling, too.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it from the
time we're born?

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
We have the influences from our
families which are telling us

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:84%
how things should be
and should not be.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have
religions telling us

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
what we should
and should not do.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the way through, you
take this wild, little flower.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And we start restricting it.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So instead of unfurling, it
starts-- the blossom starts

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:90%
closing back up, it seems.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It certainly does happen from
lots of different influences.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm kinda lucky,
you know, in-- just to show

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
the difference, because
with my parents,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
they actually didn't have a lot
of the strict times of bedtimes

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
sorts of things.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Because my sisters
and I do think

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:84%
kind of more freely
than a lot of people,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:84%
although we did go to-- all
went to a private school

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
which was quite arduous
and everything like that.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there are a lot
of different influences.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
I did enjoy school.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.052 align:middle line:84%
I think, you know, even with
that system that actually, you

00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
know, teaches you to
trust outside of yourself,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:90%
some people do flourish in it.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sort of slamming
the system as a whole.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it-- there are
rather, obviously, good things

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:90%
that people get out of it.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.993 align:middle line:84%
You can read and write and--
-Right.

00:03:44.993 --> 00:03:46.569 align:middle line:84%
Oh, sure.
-Yeah, sure.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
There are functionally
good things.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people
who are living so far

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
in the right side of
the brain that you kind

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:84%
of need to herd it in a bit
just to be able to focus,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.641 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really talking more
about just the creative aspect.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:90%
That seems to be sidelined.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
about in England.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you can tell us.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
In America, as a result
of budgetary constraints

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, one of the
first things that went

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:90%
were music and art programs.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the time for
creativity within institutions

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:90%
was really eliminated.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:90%
What's it like here?

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be getting worse.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not
an educationalist.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, I've seen in
my time as a doctor that kids

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:84%
as young as seven years
old were going pale with--

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and getting actually anemic,
some of them, you know,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.430 align:middle line:84%
through the stress of actually,
you know, the schooling,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:84%
the tests, the after-school
violin lessons,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
the swimming lessons--
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.339 align:middle line:84%
-- the schedule.
You know.

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're putting
more and more pressure

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:90%
at a younger and younger age.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And they have this sort
of adult look about them

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
now that, you know, you never
used to see in children.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.786 align:middle line:90%
No, they used to goof off.

00:04:57.786 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:84%
You have this kind of, like,
you know, "I have to perform"

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
sort of look, which is--
-Right.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So that seems to be definitely
more on the increase,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
instead of people sort of
stepping back and going,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're not getting
the results we want,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's the system
we've got to look at,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
they're just ramping
up the system.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think whatever sort
of creativity a person has,

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:84%
whatever is their genius
groove, which is, you know,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:84%
the true calling that every
soul has that they've come

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to the planet for-- and
it could be science,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:84%
or it could be, you know,
artistic-- you know,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:84%
what we normally
call as artistic.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.524 align:middle line:84%
Definitely for me, my
creativity involves science--

00:05:33.524 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.860 align:middle line:84%
 --which is, you
know, not what people

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.705 align:middle line:90%
normally think of creativity.

00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:39.369 align:middle line:84%
-But it is.
-But it is.

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
It's my-- it's part
of my creativity.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more
important that we

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.310 align:middle line:84%
constantly tell people
that their worth is

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.520 align:middle line:90%
outside of themselves.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's the important thing.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And with "Genius Groove,"
what I wanted to do

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
is to provide this idea--
the IQ and testing and all

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
of these things are
scientifically now being

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:90%
proved to be inconsistent.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not the deep science.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So you can't look to an IQ
test to tell you who you are.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't look to your
genetics, as, you know,

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton has now
revealed so eloquently.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So you know, these ideas
that, it's all in my genes,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:90%
I can't change it.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:84%
That's just my
intelligence, you know,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that my genes create how big
my brain is, how big my IQ is.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, now we're seeing that
these ideas are not scientific.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I really
wanted to get across.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
that a little bit more.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- I think
his name was Alfred Binet.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Is that correct?

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Alfred Binet, the man
who invented the IQ test.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's-- because we've
already opened this up,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about what it
was originally intended

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
for, what he saw
it as being useful

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:90%
for, and what became of it.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting how
the originator of the IQ test

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:84%
actually wanted it
to help children

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
who had learning difficulties,
as we would call it today.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And it got taken
up by other people

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and then used as a
form of, you know,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
as a form of testing
for eugenics and more

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:84%
sort of sinister type
of things to prove

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that different races weren't
as clever as other races.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's got appropriated.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's being used
in a way that it

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:90%
was never really intended for.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But we have this fixed
idea now in society

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that IQ tells us who we are
and how intelligent we are--

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, also,
if you fit the bill,

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:84%
if you look like a
white male with crazy

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.009 align:middle line:84%
and you look kinda like
Einstein or something,

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're gonna be
cleverer, which is, you know,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:90%
also where we're headed.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
We have this image of genius,
that it's only these things,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, that it's
only someone who

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
looks the part, who
has this, you know,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:90%
fixed number called IQ.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But you know, everybody
knows the story of Einstein.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Nobody recognized
that he was, you know,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.215 align:middle line:84%
someone who was
particularly tuned in.

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, when he was a child,
he was always being told--

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he was very dysfunction.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So but when Einstein
died, we actually found

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:90%
that people examined his brain.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
A neuroscientist, she
looked at his brain

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and discovered that
his parietal lobes

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
were actually wider than in
a lot of people's brains.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And at that point when she
was examining the brain,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:84%
we didn't realize
that people could

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.164 align:middle line:84%
actually-- the brain structure
could actually be altered.

00:08:27.164 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's talk about that.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:90%
What are the parietal lobes?

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
What is normally
assigned to them by way

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.919 align:middle line:90%
of function or performance?

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's interesting.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, you
know, a lot of people

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
see that as a sort of
creative sort of aspect.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But you know, for me, I don't
think you can assign a function

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.611 align:middle line:84%
to a part of the brain.
And--

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to get into that.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But what was the significance of
finding that his parietal lobes

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:90%
were wider than average?

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, people started to wonder
if it was something that he did

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:84%
in terms of spatial
recognition that actually--

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the parietal-temporal lobes are
usually associated with that.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.501 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
it's as simple as that.

00:09:08.501 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But that's what people
started to wonder.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was also his glial cells,
the actual-- which are actually

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the fatty cells
associated with neurons

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:90%
that actually increased.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't
think they're even important.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, but, see, you
know, the way you look at it

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and the larger story that we'll
get into here in a little bit--

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:84%
maybe the alteration
in the glial cells

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and the parietal
lobes has more to do

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
with the ability of
simply processing data,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking at the
brain as nothing more

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.020 align:middle line:84%
than a transmitter-receiver
data processor.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I think what was happening
was Eisenstein was putting

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:90%
his attention on something.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And the more he was putting
his attention on something,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.139 align:middle line:84%
the brain responded.
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
The brain wasn't primary
in that situation.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.406 align:middle line:84%
And we can also see that in
taxi drivers-- London cabbies,

00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:00.804 align:middle line:84%
for example.
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:10:00.804 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've seen the
famous study where we've

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
seen their parietal
lobes actually increase,

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
as well and with all the tests
that they have to go through,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:90%
quite rigorous tests.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And somebody mentioned,
people who are habitual liars

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.924 align:middle line:84%
have changes in their
brains, as well.

00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, that would make sense.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to
maintain a lot more data

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to be a liar.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember all the
stories you've told, right,

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.954 align:middle line:90%
so that you cover your tracks.

00:10:25.954 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:84%
That would make--
that would create

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.261 align:middle line:84%
a lot of-- a need for a
lot more data to be stored.

00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And now all this really
comes down to-- you know,

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:84%
we've got to move away from
this idea that genius is outside

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, genius is only
certain people who have,

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, the right
genetics, the right IQ,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.262 align:middle line:84%
that look the part--
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:10:45.262 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, and as you talked about
in your book, which-- commenting

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
about Sir Isaac
Newton, which right

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.631 align:middle line:84%
now, you have a little bit of
a rift within the scientific

00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.221 align:middle line:84%
They're saying we have to
move beyond Newtonian physics

00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and all that.
It's time to move on.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Yet at the same
time, in his day,

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
he was brilliant
and revolutionary.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:90%
But he was more than that.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part
people don't know.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you could
share a little bit.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.669 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I think he-- at
the end of the day,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I think Newton really wanted
to understand the universe

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:84%
as a whole that
included anything to do

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:90%
with what he might call "God."

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he was
obsessed with the occult.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And he actually had more papers,
more writings on the occult

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:84%
looking at alchemy,
looking at what was hidden,

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:84%
than his actual
mathematical papers.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is I
think we've taking the math,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and we've left
everything else behind.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, I think it's
become the master calculus.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's become very sterile
for children and for kids.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand when
you're looking at calculus,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
you're actually looking
deep into the universe.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're actually
understanding

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
the very patterns and the
very fabric of the universe.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.420 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting, because
he was a holistic thinker.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And so again the system
has taken the bits

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that it needs that it can be
reduced in a very mechanistic

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:84%
way in the educational
system and forgotten

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
about the holism of even the
greatest thinkers of our time.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein was more of a
holistic thinker in many ways,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:90%
too, wasn't he?

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I think he's-- he's absolutely--
so much has been written.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And people are always
quoting him on Facebook

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:90%
about his holistic thinking.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think,
ultimately, people who

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:84%
have these great breakthroughs
in science-- Faraday

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
included, you know, he was a
very-- his spirituality was

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:84%
very important to
him-- they're actually

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:90%
looking in a holistic way.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
understand the all of it.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's people who come later
and they throw away the holism

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.917 align:middle line:84%
and they take the bare bones,
the mechanistic part, and

00:12:47.917 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:90%
that's what we're left with.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't it be more
interesting if we took

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:90%
the whole story to children?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And not only that--
how they came up

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
with their various
mathematical formulas and such.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes, it was
in what we would normally

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
call an altered state
of consciousness,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe crossover state into dream
time or simply daydreaming.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've had
these experiences.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I have, as well.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:90%
They had those experiences.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.609 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: Absolutely.

00:13:13.609 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what led to
these discoveries,

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.101 align:middle line:84%
was the very opposite of what
the kids are being taught.

00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if you
told children to daydream

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:90%
all the time like Einstein?

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.018 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:23.018 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it would be wonderful.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:84%
There should be time
every day for daydreaming.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I guess that used to
be called nap time.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, years ago, my
son was-- many years ago--

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.705 align:middle line:84%
when he was a little
one in nursery school,

00:13:37.705 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
he was telling me
about something

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that was really quite shocking
about himself in another time.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, where
did you see that?

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, I was supposed
be taking a nap at Busy Bee.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And he was lying there.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was tapped into
something in England,

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of fact--
a place he knew

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.970 align:middle line:90%
nothing of at the age of three.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:90%
I had a retweet about Regina.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So I love those stories
about your son and--

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, the point
is he was just expanding

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
into his own field, the
same as anyone else's

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
when they're coming up with
any of these genius moments

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
that we then inherent
and become incorporated

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:90%
into our formal education.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
But let's-- do you think that
this would be the right time

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:84%
to start exploring
into the notion of what

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.984 align:middle line:90%
people are really tapping into?

00:14:22.984 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I know this takes
us back into "Punk Science"

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and the black hole theories.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
really appropriate.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if you understand
that, then we can understand

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
what genius really is.
-Well, yes.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Because if you-- if we
take-- if we've already

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
said that genius is
not just about-- well,

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:84%
it's not about
what's in your genes.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Because, as Bruce Lipton
has said, you know,

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
the genes-- and we've found
out in mainstream biology--

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.780 align:middle line:90%
the genes aren't in control.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The genes-- people
still have this idea

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that everything-- all
their characteristics, all

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
their personality, everything
that they-- all their traits,

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
including their intelligence,
are all based in their genes.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
We now know that through
the Human Genome Project

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and others studies like
that, that, you know,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:90%
it's not about that.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
We've got the same genome as,
you know, as a dog, as a mouse.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.164 align:middle line:84%
Well, and half the
genes of a rice plant.

00:15:19.164 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
That kind of puts
it in perspective.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.014 align:middle line:90%
I remember 60,000--

00:15:24.014 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: That's right.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:84%
 --in rice plants, 30,000,
roughly, in human beings.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.278 align:middle line:84%
Now they're saying less
than that in humans.

00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So you know, that sort
of says-- and we expected

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
to find-- you know,
we're so big and clever,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.214 align:middle line:84%
we're gonna have like, you
know, 150,000, at least.

00:15:40.214 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's not
our genetic complexity.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.713 align:middle line:90%
We know it's not our genetics.

00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:44.371 align:middle line:84%
And that's coming from
mainstream biology now.

00:15:44.371 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-And not everybody's caught up.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But the real people
at the cutting edge

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:84%
have kind of left this idea
that genes make us who we are.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:90%
So where do we go from there?

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
If it's not our
genes, if it's not--

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.200 align:middle line:84%
if that isn't the basis of
IQ and all those things,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:90%
where does genius come from?

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And the new idea is coming
not just from myself,

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
but other authors, as
well, Ervin Laszlo,

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
and people like Liam McTaggart.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about the
quantum vacuum and the fact

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
that in quantum physics,
we have this idea

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
of particles of light popping
in and out of existence all

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And those particles of light
also hold a lot of information.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So we probably have all heard
of wave particle duality--

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.730 align:middle line:84%
the particles are seen
as waves or particles,

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
you look at them.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So waves of light, when you
actually-- when they actually

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:84%
intersect, the intersection
points create--

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
they're the most efficient
storage system that we know of,

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's surrounding us.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:51.357 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream about
that many years ago.

00:16:51.357 --> 00:16:52.056 align:middle line:90%
Oh, did you?

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what I was shown.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I was shown this
electrical grid.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was showing
that the vector

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.700 align:middle line:84%
points-- intersection
points-- is

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:90%
where information was stored.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:90%
And this was 20 years ago.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.349 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know quite what
to make of it at the time.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:84%
But then when I read about
this in your book, I thought,

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:90%
makes perfect sense.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's amazing.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's really good
validation that, you know,

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:84%
we are actually living in
this holographic universe.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is just
when you take a hologram

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.307 align:middle line:84%
that people create on a
sort of photographic film,

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and you cut piece up, and
you shine a laser through it.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't just get a
small part of the image.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:90%
You get the whole image.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So is the actual universe
itself being seen as a hologram.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want to emphasize
that this isn't just

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.317 align:middle line:84%
coming from people that
are woo-woo scientists that

00:17:38.317 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:90%
are at the edge.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.406 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: No, not at all.

00:17:40.406 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is some of the
mainstream scientists or people

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.011 align:middle line:84%
working in loop quantum gravity
And other areas of science,

00:17:47.011 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
The people-- the physicists
in the universities themselves

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:84%
are saying that the
universe is a hologram.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So that means that whenever
you are in the universe,

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
access all around you

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:90%
the information of the whole.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So the new view of genius
is that the brain is not

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:90%
the generator of consciousness.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
People have looked
in newer science

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
to try and find that little
lump that is consciousness.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:90%
And they can't find it.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
doing is the brain

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:84%
is then sort of a receiver
and a transmitter, really.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And so consciousness
is everywhere.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Amit Goswami famously says the
consciousness is fundamental,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
fundamental of being.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:90%
It's the ground of all being.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:90%
It is everywhere.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And the information is stored
in these light intersection

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:90%
points around us.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:90%
And we can tune in.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And we-- depending on what
is our unique frequency,

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
we can actually tune in and
take the information through

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:90%
our brains and articulate them.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And the more still we are,
like your son in Busy Bee--

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
--the more that
we can, you know,

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
come out of space and
time and the deeper

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.635 align:middle line:84%
we're going into this field, so
the more authentic the message

00:19:03.635 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:90%
is that comes through.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And you know, people say all
the time about those moments

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:10.570 align:middle line:84%
of inspiration,
including my own,

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
come when we're
not expecting them,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:84%
when we're about to fall asleep,
when we've just woken up,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
when we're meditating,
when we're doing

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
something that takes us
out of space and time,

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.960 align:middle line:90%
deeper into the field.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:84%
We can tune more
into that unique--

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:90%
the information that's there.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're all
different receivers.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's our
unique genius groove.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their
own frequency.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
They resonate with the
field in a different way.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And they bring through their
own unique information.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's a
genius in that way.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is it
requires an access point.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, the
brain does come into play.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:84%
We do have conscious
thoughts, as well,

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
which we-- tend to be, sadly,
habitual most of the time.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Most of it is very-- we're
running our programs.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a lot of people
notice it's-- to me,

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:84%
it's very disturbing if
I fall into this pattern.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But if I notice that my
thoughts are the same as the day

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:84%
before or the day before
and my mind is wandering

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.550 align:middle line:84%
toward the same
places over and over,

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
trouble in here somewhere.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'll do whatever I
can to shake that loose.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that
habituation is really

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
acting as a block, or
a filter, over keeping

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.381 align:middle line:84%
the contact between ourselves
and the field at bay.

00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:10%
And we do see-- as I said,
you know, what we focus on,

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:10%
we do see neurological changes.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:10%
But it's the actual
consciousness itself

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.164 align:middle line:10%
that is fundamental to that.

00:20:38.164 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:10%
You know, when we actually
do studies on the brain,

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.165 align:middle line:10%
we have to provide some sort of
stimulation to get the respond.

00:20:44.165 --> 00:20:45.665 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And we
have to make choices.

00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:46.364 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:46.364 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
We do have to make
a decision that we're

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.494 align:middle line:90%
going to even explore, right?

00:20:49.494 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON:
Yes, yeah.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so where
does that figure in?

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Because you have this
brain that is habitual,

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that can provide-- act
as a filter, rather.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the
same time, you need

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
to have some kind of
command over your brain,

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
at least to the point where you
can initiate a choice, right?

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
the brain is the

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.224 align:middle line:90%
primary habit-forming thing.

00:21:13.224 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the consciousness.
-More the subconscious?

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the consciousness.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to always
bring that down to that.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, if
you take a bit of brain

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and go deep enough,
you know, all you're

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:90%
gonna find is consciousness.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing there.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.240 align:middle line:84%
We know, of course, when
you break down an atom

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and you go down
the brain itself,

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
your body itself, it
is all consciousness.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:90%
It is information fundamentally.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it would be
better to say that what we call

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind, which
is the habituated part,

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:84%
it's not actually
the expansive part.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the part
that's-- that keeps

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
us from bumping into things.
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the consciousness,

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
the full consciousness
of the being.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think the
whole lot is actually

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
based on consciousness,
and the brain responds.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And keeping it that
way is actually,

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.015 align:middle line:90%
really, a lot more simple.

00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot more
useful, as well.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's like
you're not so focused.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:90%
The brain is simply responding.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And it also sends the
signals to the body.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that is-- that's
a complex, you know,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:90%
function in itself.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But I think when it comes
to our what you might call

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:84%
conscious thoughts, you've still
got to keep it in the realm

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness itself.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's your subconscious
emotions that are repeating

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:90%
something for some reason.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's more useful
to actually go back

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.680 align:middle line:84%
in your own consciousness
and explore why that is

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.215 align:middle line:84%
and not so focused on,
well, my brain's doing it.

00:22:33.215 --> 00:22:35.815 align:middle line:84%
You know, because your
brain's just responding to it.

00:22:35.815 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's something
in your consciousness

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:84%
as a being that's actually
sort of creating--

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
a good distinction.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Whichever that part is that
you choose to use in a focused

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.720 align:middle line:84%
manner-- the part that
I'm referring to--

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
is the part that
also can be used

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.757 align:middle line:84%
to be able to expand
out into your more

00:22:55.757 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:90%
vast realm of consciousness.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: Absolutely.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it actually
does take a decision.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.460 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something that just
happens, for the most part.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can have your
transcendental momentary flash

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:90%
of insight.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to progress and
go into partnership with it,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.300 align:middle line:84%
doesn't that require something
a little more committed?

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's the sort of
becoming into awareness

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and to actually get the
awareness that you are

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:84%
having habitual
consciousness thoughts

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:90%
and that is going around.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the sort of light bulb
moment for a lot of people.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And to actually
go on from there,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:84%
to actually go, well,
where do those come from?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:84%
That's when you get
into the emotional work.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
OK.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to go into that.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
also go into something

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:90%
called negative timelines.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that's probably
the most controversial

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
portion of your work.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:90%
And the most liberating.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And the most-- absolutely--
and most comforting and the most

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:90%
liberating.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little
difficult for people

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:90%
to get their minds around.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So since we're still
kind of in the-- we're

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
in the consciousness,
black hole theory

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%
part of the conversation.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Is that a good time to start
looking at negative timelines?

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.815 align:middle line:84%
Or would you rather talk about
the emotional part first?

00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: Yeah, I think

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.130 align:middle line:84%
it seems like a bit of a
flow to go onto the emotions.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.271 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go on to
the emotions, then.

00:24:15.271 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Because, really, a lot of
the stuff we're responding to

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
is almost-- well,
it's saturating

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
the very intelligence within
the cells of our body,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the habituated stuff.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.476 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.

00:24:25.476 --> 00:24:26.835 align:middle line:90%
That happens even before birth.

00:24:26.835 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us about
ourselves as emotional beings

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:90%
from before birth.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
really key if you are

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:90%
to get into your genius groove.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason
why people don't is

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:84%
because there's something that's
blocking them emotionally.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And emotions are
really denigrated

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of teachings.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're just
something coming from a part

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:90%
of the body or anything.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Although, the body does
respond, as Steven Sisgold

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
has written that excellent
book-- hasn't he-- on,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.660 align:middle line:90%
you know, how that works.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to see emotions--
I see emotions as consciousness

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:90%
below the speed of light.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.994 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:25:07.994 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness below the
speed of light, yes.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So below the speed of
light, consciousness

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.840 align:middle line:90%
takes on the aspect of charge.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's those charges
and the split that

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
happen below the speed
of light that we are then

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:90%
trying to integrate, you know.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So but how it effects
us in our world is,

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:84%
you know, as you said, even
before birth, we come in,

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
our soul, as you might
say, or our sort of essence

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.430 align:middle line:84%
comes in with a
[INAUDIBLE], anyway,

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and chooses the parents that
are going to give them exactly--

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
give you exactly the--
exactly what you need,

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
exactly what you need
to learn in that life.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And you go through--
a friend of mine

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:84%
calls it sort of a
primary-- a primary event.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And they sometimes can
happen in the womb.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And so she writes about
how the primary event then

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:90%
attracts the secondary events.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So because what that does
is it shifts the frequency

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.075 align:middle line:84%
of the person through the
initial emotional sort

00:26:09.075 --> 00:26:13.280 align:middle line:90%
of frequency in the change.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.585 align:middle line:84%
And then the
secondary events are

00:26:14.585 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:90%
then attracted to that person.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And then everything else
in that person's life--

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea
of a primary event.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
A primary event,
for example, I did

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:84%
a treatment on a young
guy who had a sort

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.635 align:middle line:90%
of ME type of illness and--

00:26:28.635 --> 00:26:30.406 align:middle line:84%
-He had what type of illness?
-I'm sorry.

00:26:30.406 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Chronic fatigue.
-Chronic fatigue, OK.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, chronic
fatigue-type of illness.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Very young.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And he-- when I actually
went through the process--

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:84%
because whenever I work--
whenever I used to work

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.760 align:middle line:84%
with children-- I no
longer work as a healer--

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
but I always wanted
the mother there.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when you actually
go through the process,

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
you actually
realize that there's

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.590 align:middle line:84%
something that has happened
when that child was in the womb.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:84%
There's always something
that the mother is

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:90%
probably feeling guilty about.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:90%
There may be a huge argument.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
There may have been,
you know, even an almost

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:90%
splitting with the father.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that's happened.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the mother
has a huge amount

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.250 align:middle line:90%
of shame about that incident.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And so usually when
you work with children,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.313 align:middle line:84%
you can go back to
this primary incident.

00:27:16.313 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:84%
If the mother is around,
she'll eventually admit

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:90%
that, yes, this has happened.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:90%
It's stuck in her mind.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- you know, she
doesn't often talk about it.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Because she has a lot of guilt.
So if you have a sick child,

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.776 align:middle line:90%
you can often do that.

00:27:30.776 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So that softens-- it may
not be as extreme as that.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But usually, there's,
like, a primary incident

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that happens either in the
womb or in early childhood.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And that changes their frequency
to attract other things

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:90%
towards-- towards that person.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
else in their life,

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.101 align:middle line:84%
basically, is a complex
of that, you know.

00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So you can take incidents
that are happening as an adult

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and trace it back to something
that happened as a child,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.310 align:middle line:84%
right back to this
primary incident.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And then that, naturally,
starts driving us

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:84%
toward the conversation
of free will

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and choice points and genius.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Because, ultimately, you
would have to say that child

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:90%
chose that family.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:84%
That being chose that
experience if we're

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:90%
going down this road, right?

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.014 align:middle line:84%
So even though it sounds
like a bad thing, you know,

00:28:27.014 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:90%
really, there's no judgement.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.139 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Not necessarily.

00:28:29.139 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgment.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.670 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The choices are made at a very,
like, high level of ourselves,

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.770 align:middle line:90%
beyond the speed of light.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:39.881 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, we're going to
get into that in some depth.

00:28:39.881 --> 00:28:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
just a wee, little break.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And in just a minute,
we'll come back.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about free will.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.038 align:middle line:90%
What is free will?

00:28:49.038 --> 00:28:52.510 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:52.510 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.620 align:middle line:10%
And we're back talking with
Dr. Manjir Samanta-Laughton

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:10%
about the genius groove.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:10%
And one thing that
we've learned so far

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:10%
is that genius is not in
here, it's everywhere but.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And now we need to start getting
into that, everywhere but part.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you would like to go
ahead and start explaining how

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:84%
this all works-- how
consciousness works

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and how we take it and
then we start molding it.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:90%
And we do have choice points.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But the choices aren't
necessarily always

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.858 align:middle line:84%
coming from here, as in the "how
to not bump into things" part.

00:29:38.858 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:41.670 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:84%
That's quite a
small brief, Regina.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.938 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:43.938 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, how would you
like me to start?

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Can we break that down a bit?
'Cause that's the-- that's

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:90%
the universe and everything.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes we did.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We're getting into a bit of the
science behind it now as-- you

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:84%
were talking about--
we were coming out

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:90%
of the subject of emotions--

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:01.940 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:84%
 --and now going into a bit
of the principles behind it.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I want this to
lead us to both free will

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:90%
and negative timelines.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's start with
my own big genius moment.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:10%
And part of the reasons
why I wrote "Genius Groove"

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:10%
and started this topic
is because, you know,

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:10%
I didn't do well--
I did OK at school.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I got
into medical school

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and I went through
medical school.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:90%
But I had to work hard for it.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And every single--
in medical school

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.120 align:middle line:90%
itself, I just-- I hated it.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was failing exams.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And I really didn't
apply myself.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
people were telling

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:90%
me I wasn't going to make it.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And I managed to get through
the five years and, you know,

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
get through that study.
And then I--

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Why did you do it to
begin with, though?

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Why did I do it?

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I had such a strong drive
from when I was very young.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:10%
Even though my parents
are both doctors,

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't a case of them just
saying, OK-- and they did.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:10%
They said, you need
to go into medicine,

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:10%
as a Bengali-British
family, you know,

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.050 align:middle line:10%
the sort of traditional things.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, my grandfather
was a doctor.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And in our society--
in Bengali society--

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.480 align:middle line:84%
you need to have at
least somebody who's

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
in medicine in the family.
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And you were the
designated child

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like, you
know, that's just how it is.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're expected
to go into medicine.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just that, though.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I had a big drive
in the-- and now I

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:84%
see that it was-- we'll
talk about it in a minute--

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, part
of me knew that that's

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.180 align:middle line:84%
what I needed to go on to
the rest of-- you know,

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:90%
my life would unfold from there.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And it has, you know.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And medicine has
been a big part.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And who I've met there and
what happened there has been--

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.420 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have
happened if I hadn't

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:90%
gone to med school in London.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of interesting.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.700 align:middle line:90%
It was driven from me.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But when I got to med school,
the very first lecture

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:84%
at the dean's address,
I was actually late.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of set
the whole thing up.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.040 align:middle line:84%
My poor roommate, who I'd only
just met, was seriously ill.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:90%
She had gastroenteritis.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was so busy helping her,
I didn't get to college in time.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of set
the whole energy.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And here I am storming
into the dean's address.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And he realized, you know.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:18.860 align:middle line:90%
But it kind of set the energy.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't feel
like it was right for me.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And it sent me into
a massive crisis.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I was thinking,
you know, this

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:90%
is what I wanted all my life.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:29.200 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:90%
How come I don't feel motivated?

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.915 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't
really say I enjoyed

00:32:34.915 --> 00:32:37.190 align:middle line:90%
the whole five years of it.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And I did-- I didn't
do brilliantly.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of
med school, went

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
into my what you call
internships, I think,

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.790 align:middle line:90%
in the US, and long hours.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, I didn't do
very brilliantly in that.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.450 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed doing the work.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.040 align:middle line:90%
And I learned a lot.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.694 align:middle line:90%
But I was not, like, a top--

00:32:55.694 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
You weren't in
your genius groove.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I wasn't in
my genius groove.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And I would go on going,
what is it I'm good at?

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:05.520 align:middle line:84%
What-- and at the time, I was
married to a high-flying medic.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And so he was seen as the,
you know, the genius, the one

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
that was winning
all the scholarships

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:90%
and the prizes and everything.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
very marked difference

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.320 align:middle line:90%
between myself and him.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting who you choose
to do your reflections with.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
when I, you know,

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.115 align:middle line:84%
started speaking on the
science of consciousness

00:33:25.115 --> 00:33:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and the science of
spirituality people

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:84%
started to call me a
genius and started to,

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, say, well, she's
got the brain the size

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.160 align:middle line:84%
of a planet-- I'm thinking,
how does it go from-- I'm

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
the same person.
How does it go from--

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.713 align:middle line:84%
A mediocre med student to a
brain the size of a planet.

00:33:40.713 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was
getting into the genius

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.430 align:middle line:90%
groove that was the thing.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, my particular
way that I relate to the field

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and the information
in the universe

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.680 align:middle line:84%
is I can kind of see
how the universe works.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:90%
I can see into things.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:90%
And I get information through.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And one particular
incident of that

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.500 align:middle line:84%
gave me what I'm calling
the Black Hole Principle.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And so again, I was-- I'd
started writing "Punk Science."

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, I was in one of those
moments that you're kind of not

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.730 align:middle line:90%
focused on something.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:23.714 align:middle line:84%
And I just decided to sort of
sit on the branch of a tree,

00:34:23.714 --> 00:34:25.739 align:middle line:84%
as I think we've
discussed before.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:30.179 align:middle line:84%
And it all came through, this
sort of-- I actually was in it.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:33.290 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to describe, because
it's not like I was seeing it.

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was not like
I was thinking it,

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:90%
or even that it channeled.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Because I do channel.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:90%
I know what that feels like.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:43.750 align:middle line:84%
It was being in the
consciousness of nature itself.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And the vastness of
that is quite amazing.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And within-- I don't even
know how long that moment was.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, all the
pieces came together

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:58.270 align:middle line:84%
of all the problems in
cosmology I'd been looking at

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the sort
of things-- aspects

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.710 align:middle line:90%
of dark energy, dark matter.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.460 align:middle line:84%
All of that suddenly
came together.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
realized that we've got

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.420 align:middle line:90%
black holes completely wrong.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this
picture that black holes

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.250 align:middle line:84%
are these great
guzzling monsters,

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I realized that's
completely reversed.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, just to give
you-- give a bit of background,

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I do talk in "Genius
Groove" why it was I

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:84%
had all this time
to contemplate.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.019 align:middle line:84%
-Right, right.
-You know.

00:35:28.019 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:84%
You have a very juicy
personal story in here,

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:90%
just so you know that.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:84%
The underpinnings of all
this are well-described.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it was
very painful for you.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.636 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.

00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, you had to
go through your own dark night

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and journey
in order to be able to be

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.330 align:middle line:90%
open enough to experience--

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:44.600 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: Absolutely.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.780 align:middle line:84%
 --to be able to
do what you do.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.171 align:middle line:84%
And I have lived
these principles.

00:35:47.171 --> 00:35:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.790 align:middle line:84%
This is why I wanted
to tell my story,

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.090 align:middle line:84%
not because I wanted to point
any fingers or anything,

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
but because I knew that I had
to say, this actually is real.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.730 align:middle line:84%
These principles that I'm
talking about are real.

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So what came through
was that black holes

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.270 align:middle line:84%
are actually the creative
centers of the universe.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
at a black hole is not

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.920 align:middle line:84%
this sort of gobbling up,
that, actually, infinite light

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:84%
comes from the center
of a black hole.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And the light sort of spirals
through all of the dimensions.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And in science, we know
there's many dimensions

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets to the
edge of all reality.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And that, the edge
of all reality,

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:90%
is at the speed of light.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So I've renamed that
the perception horizon.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Which is beautiful.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.321 align:middle line:84%
It's-- you couldn't have
found a better term for it.

00:36:41.321 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Perception horizon,
I love that.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, really, most
of the universe, the scientists

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.430 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's there.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.420 align:middle line:84%
They call it dark
energy, dark matter--

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just beyond
our perception.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So instead of saying
that it's mysterious,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:84%
it's just that we're so
focused on the physical

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and what's below the speed of
light, what we can measure.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually, most of the
universe is unknown to us.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Talk to any
cosmologist, and they'll

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.850 align:middle line:84%
tell you that 99% of
the universe, they

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:90%
don't know what stuff's made of.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Yet they call it
the standard model.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.951 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
the end of science.

00:37:15.951 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's just like--

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, and calling
95% of us junk DNA,

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that I found laughable
the first time I ever heard it.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to talk
about that a bit, yeah.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, just because it
doesn't code for a gene,

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.140 align:middle line:84%
you know, just
because it doesn't

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:84%
produce something
physical doesn't

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:84%
mean it's not doing anything.
-Exactly.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's so much
that we need to explore

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:84%
in both our, you
know, our genome

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
and also the
universe as a whole.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a reflection of the fact
that so much is unknown to us.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.215 align:middle line:84%
So I realized this
in the moment,

00:37:46.215 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
that actually what's happening
is the light-- if we can call

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.090 align:middle line:84%
it, again, a photon--
it gets to the edge

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:57.460 align:middle line:84%
of our perception, the speed
of light, and it splits.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a
positron and electron,

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.280 align:middle line:84%
or a particle of
matter, and its partner

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.010 align:middle line:90%
mirror particle of antimatter.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And the particle of
matter is what we would

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.785 align:middle line:90%
call our everyday reality.

00:38:11.785 --> 00:38:14.980 align:middle line:90%
So that creates our world.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just something
that I had an insight about.

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I spent years actually
looking at all the data

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that are coming down
from our telescopes

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and finding that this
is actually the case,

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:31.410 align:middle line:84%
that electrons are
coming out of black holes

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
at the center of galaxies
at the speed of light.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.050 align:middle line:84%
In some measurements,
they've actually

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.750 align:middle line:90%
them 25% faster than light.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.364 align:middle line:84%
And they've done a
little bit of fudging.

00:38:41.364 --> 00:38:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, it's
going to-- you know, we're not

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.460 align:middle line:84%
looking at it-- if you
don't look at it straight on

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and you calculate for
that, it's actually

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.350 align:middle line:90%
95% the speed of light.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
they'll tell you now.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So why is it they're coming
out so fast and seemingly

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.870 align:middle line:90%
out of nowhere?

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you pick up a
copy of "Scientific

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.110 align:middle line:84%
American" or "New
Scientist" and have a look,

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.660 align:middle line:90%
this is a mystery to them.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, they actually
can't figure out

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.130 align:middle line:84%
why this is happening,
because it's only

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.544 align:middle line:90%
just reached our perception.

00:39:08.544 --> 00:39:09.310 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So we see it as
coming out of nowhere,

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.720 align:middle line:84%
when, actually,
it's the infinity

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that's just slowed down enough
to actually be perceived by us.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
step-down process--

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:20.750 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.890 align:middle line:84%
 --when you're talking
about multi-dimensionality.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Right?
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk
about that a little bit

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.660 align:middle line:84%
so people can get a nice
visual in their head

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.360 align:middle line:84%
about this stepping down
until it reaches this density

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.160 align:middle line:84%
below the speed of light that
we can perceive as reality,

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.610 align:middle line:90%
which is 5% of our reality?

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:41.660 align:middle line:84%
It's-- of course, the step-down
process beyond the speed

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.500 align:middle line:84%
of light is not-- we
have to think of it

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
as a step-down process
because we think

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.400 align:middle line:84%
of things in a linear way.
-Right.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So science tells us-- string
theory and other theories

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.380 align:middle line:84%
like that actually tell us
there are many dimensions

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.200 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.161 align:middle line:84%
So we're familiar with
three dimensions of space

00:40:01.161 --> 00:40:01.860 align:middle line:90%
and one of time.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.990 align:middle line:84%
That's how scientists
think of it.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of go up and down,
side to side, back and forth.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And we also-- the
extra dimension of time

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is that, you know, we decided
to meet at a certain time

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.070 align:middle line:90%
today to have this interview.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So I had to get myself
here at the right time.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we
see this dimension.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But we know from other
certain theories in science

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.980 align:middle line:84%
that there are many
dimensions to the universe

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and that, also, the
universe is, fundamentally,

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:35.390 align:middle line:90%
vibration, vibrating strings.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what string
theory tells us.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So depending on where you
find yourself in the universe,

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.670 align:middle line:90%
it's according to that-- sorry.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:84%
The vibr-- if I put it the other
way, depending on how-- what

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.590 align:middle line:84%
frequency you're at is
the vibration that-- is

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.320 align:middle line:90%
the dimension that you're in.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
what science tells us,

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:57.250 align:middle line:90%
it sounds quite new-agey.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's
exactly what string

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.695 align:middle line:84%
theory is saying, that
there are many dimensions

00:41:01.695 --> 00:41:02.750 align:middle line:90%
to the universe.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And they create
certain geometries.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it depends
on the vibration

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.745 align:middle line:90%
as to what dimension you're in.

00:41:10.745 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's many, many
different dimensions.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.761 align:middle line:84%
And people themselves
have many dimensions.

00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very important
part to note here--

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:20.513 align:middle line:90%
we are also multi-dimensional.

00:41:20.513 --> 00:41:22.660 align:middle line:90%
We are all multi-dimensional.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.920 align:middle line:10%
It's to the point
where, you know,

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.680 align:middle line:10%
you have to wonder-- people
talk about your guardian angel--

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.450 align:middle line:10%
if it's simply a
higher aspect of you.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:30.450 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right, right.

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:34.610 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately,
everything is one.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:10%
The other part of the
Black Hole Principle

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:10%
is that the center of the black
hole, it's the same everywhere.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So black holes are not just
the center in the galaxy--

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:84%
are not just in the
center of galaxies.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.554 align:middle line:84%
The universe is a
fractal, and it's

00:41:49.554 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:90%
black holes all the way down.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's what
I loved about that book,

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.130 align:middle line:84%
"Punk Science," is that you
were talking about the fact

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:59.310 align:middle line:84%
that every atom, the atomic
structure itself-- which,

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.680 align:middle line:84%
of course, we know is as much
space as our solar system

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.710 align:middle line:84%
is-- has a black
hole in its center,

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:84%
a black hole of creation
taking information

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.791 align:middle line:90%
in from other dimensions.

00:42:09.791 --> 00:42:10.990 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: Absolutely.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.975 align:middle line:90%
Which is just fascinating.

00:42:12.975 --> 00:42:13.690 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the first to really
come across this, either.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there
have been people,

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.870 align:middle line:84%
like Walter Russell and
John Keely and people

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:28.190 align:middle line:84%
throughout the ages, who saw
this in a mystical sense.

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.710 align:middle line:84%
But what we have now
is we have the data.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're in an era
where we can actually

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.160 align:middle line:84%
see the particles coming
out of black holes,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:90%
the matter and the antimatter.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening at every
single-- every single level

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.400 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Earth's
upper atmosphere,

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.790 align:middle line:84%
it's black holes
all the way down.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:54.595 align:middle line:84%
So NASA has just sent out some--
to measure the actual gamma

00:42:54.595 --> 00:42:57.350 align:middle line:84%
ray flashes and
the-- we've actually

00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:00.820 align:middle line:84%
found that the antimatter comes
out of the gamma ray flashes,

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.720 align:middle line:84%
just as I would have
predicted, just as I

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720 align:middle line:90%
predicted in "Punk Science."

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
As you saw it, yes.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, we hadn't
actually measured it.

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But we measured
it like last year.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we actually now know
that antimatter comes out

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.250 align:middle line:84%
of the terrestrial gamma
ray flashes in the Earth's

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:90%
upper atmosphere.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And the implications of
this go directly, also,

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.464 align:middle line:90%
into the negative timeline.

00:43:21.464 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, this has very
personal repercussions.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the personal
repercussions.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So what does all this
mean for you if everything

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:30.390 align:middle line:90%
is occurring like this?

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the edge of the
black hole, as I said,

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
the photon splits
into the electron.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes our world.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the
antimatter positron.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And at different levels of
the Black Hole Principle,

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.820 align:middle line:84%
it's actually
different particles.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But you know, what
you need to remember

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:84%
is that there's matter which has
positive time and antimatter.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And the antimatter
world is in a slightly

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:58.340 align:middle line:90%
different frequency to ours.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It's in the realm of c squared.

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.370 align:middle line:10%
So we know that
the speed of light

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:10%
is called little c in
physics a lot of the time.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:11.291 align:middle line:10%
And so c squared is kind of the
frequency of the mirror world.

00:44:11.291 --> 00:44:11.990 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.600 align:middle line:10%
So everything that
happens in our world

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:10%
that is-- in our world,
you go into positive time.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And in the c squared
region, you've actually

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.770 align:middle line:90%
gone into negative time.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately,
everything cancels out.

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And there is no time.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So beyond all of this in
the higher dimensions,

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.160 align:middle line:84%
there is no time, just
as all the mystics say.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But actually, below the
c and c squared region,

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:84%
you've got positive time and
you've got negative time.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
light pretending to split.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And we live in the
positive time region.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.082 align:middle line:90%
But guess what.

00:44:47.082 --> 00:44:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we do in
the positive time region

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.980 align:middle line:84%
has already happened in
the negative time region.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The two timelines are
meeting each other.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this has some
deep implications.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's also hard for people
to get their minds around.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.490 align:middle line:90%
I have to say this very gently.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But I have taken a lot of
people through this process.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And when they get it, it's
very, very liberating.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm really saying
is everything in your future

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:17.930 align:middle line:90%
has already happened.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So everything that--
so where's the choice?

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So people get freaked out
because they're saying,

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.490 align:middle line:84%
where is the choice,
where is the choice?

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it,
it's completely logical.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that
I went into this thinking

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:middle line:90%
that that was the truth.

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But when I saw
the science of it,

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.880 align:middle line:84%
it was like, well,
that has to be.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way that you can
have the eternal now, in fact.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Because people talk about
the eternal now-- time

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:49.080 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really
exist in relativity.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a way that
you can reconcile it.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Because you have the
below the speed of light,

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:58.120 align:middle line:84%
the below the-- below c and
below c squared regions.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And ultimately, they cancel out.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So you have time and no
time at the same time.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And we are eternal,
multi-dimensional beings.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So because we are
multi-dimensional, the aspects

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.280 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves in the c
region that we call,

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe, the c squared--
I'm sorry, the C.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And we have the c squared.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So the C-- the below the
speed of light aspect--

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:25.140 align:middle line:84%
is the aspect of ourselves
that we call the ego self.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.811 align:middle line:84%
So the ego self doesn't know
what's about to happen to them.

00:46:28.811 --> 00:46:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Psychics can--
we go to psychics

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:90%
who tune to the c squared.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And they can tell us,
well, you know, I can see.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I've been told that stranger
in your future, or whatever.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.034 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're drawing from.

00:46:41.034 --> 00:46:42.966 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: That's
what they're drawing from.

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And also remote viewers that
are viewing into the future.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.590 align:middle line:84%
All those experiments
have been conducted

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and are done and dusted.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.860 align:middle line:90%
That's a reality.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Militaries around the world
use the same technique

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to be able to gauge
whatever's going to happen

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:56.360 align:middle line:90%
strategically in the future.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though
this is woo-woo.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:46:59.390 align:middle line:90%
This is flat-out.

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:00.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just covert.

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fair
to say it's covert.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's also--
because we don't

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.924 align:middle line:84%
know the scientific mechanism,
a lot of people reject it.

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:07.990 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right, exactly.

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:10.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you realize that
people are tuning into c

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.720 align:middle line:84%
squared, it becomes,
you know-- there's

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.780 align:middle line:90%
a mechanism now that we have.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.530 align:middle line:84%
That's not all there
is, too, though.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.140 align:middle line:84%
What's making the choice if--
-Exactly.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, if
you're feeling now,

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.430 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't make any
choice in my life,

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.010 align:middle line:90%
you're multi-dimensional.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.620 align:middle line:84%
You're also beyond
the c and c squared.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're making a choice
at, as you would say,

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.860 align:middle line:90%
the soul level, the higher self.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And you decide it.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Because in that region,
there is no space and time.

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:36.890 align:middle line:84%
There is no time.
-Exactly.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So now let's expand on that
with your own experience,

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.800 align:middle line:84%
which, in a sense, I've had
a very similar experience,

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.050 align:middle line:84%
but in a different way,
a different career path.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But isolating on
that, here you are.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.700 align:middle line:84%
You're born into this Bengali
family that expects to have

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.320 align:middle line:90%
a doctor each generation.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.780 align:middle line:90%
You're tagged for it.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So the soul has
already made a choice

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.910 align:middle line:90%
to come into this family.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.550 align:middle line:84%
You're not necessarily
enjoying the process of going

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:04.470 align:middle line:90%
through medical school.

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:06.800 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking,
this is a disconnect.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing this?

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.260 align:middle line:90%
And yet you're doing it, anyway.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.360 align:middle line:90%
And you can't help yourself.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And something in you
knows from an early age

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.140 align:middle line:90%
you're going to do this.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.640 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just programming.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So pick it up from
there and talk

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.890 align:middle line:84%
about how this works
within us so we really

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:22.960 align:middle line:90%
get the free will part of it.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.950 align:middle line:84%
If everybody looks
back at their lives,

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:29.510 align:middle line:84%
they'll see, gosh, everything
has actually stacked up for me

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:30.990 align:middle line:90%
to do exactly this thing.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.954 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, where's
the choice, you know?

00:48:33.954 --> 00:48:36.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like everything has
actually led up-- so it's

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.550 align:middle line:90%
not the ego self choosing.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.010 align:middle line:90%
It is the higher self.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And this really did save
my life, this knowledge.

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when I actually later
on-- and this is explained

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.800 align:middle line:84%
in "The Genius Groove"-- but
my mystical abilities alerted

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.320 align:middle line:90%
my ex-husband and my parents.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were
concerned about me.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.660 align:middle line:84%
When my ex-husband and I
split up, he actually told

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.070 align:middle line:84%
my parents about my mystic--
-You were strange.

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah-- and went into my
computer and, you know,

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:09.490 align:middle line:90%
all of the channellings.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:11.827 align:middle line:84%
You know how our
sort of community

00:49:11.827 --> 00:49:12.660 align:middle line:90%
can look to other people.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:15.551 align:middle line:84%
Well, you were consuming a lot
of books, a lot of lectures,

00:49:15.551 --> 00:49:16.250 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:17.216 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.

00:49:17.216 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:84%
You were very interested
in the full reach of life.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And yes, at that point,
I was channeling.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:25.950 align:middle line:10%
So it was a genuine thing.

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:28.660 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't like it was a hobby.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.630 align:middle line:10%
You know, I am a
multi-dimensional being,

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.490 align:middle line:10%
and aware of it.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.340 align:middle line:10%
So it was being expressed.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
my marriage, you know,

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.260 align:middle line:90%
had to go through this split.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And after that happened, I
found myself with a psychiatrist

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.840 align:middle line:90%
on my front door.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And so in that moment,
this knowledge really,

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:53.280 align:middle line:90%
really kept it together for me.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Because yes, it was an awful
lot of pain and difficulty,

00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.820 align:middle line:84%
but what really brought
me through that.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up being
referred for my mental health

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:90%
to the medical board.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, although
they couldn't find anything

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.555 align:middle line:90%
wrong with me, I quit anyway.

00:50:09.555 --> 00:50:10.855 align:middle line:84%
They were putting
sort of restrictions.

00:50:10.855 --> 00:50:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you know,
this is my message to go.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time,
knowing this principle

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.240 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually your higher
self that has set everything up

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.050 align:middle line:90%
was so liberating.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It means that there
are no wrong choices.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.800 align:middle line:84%
There are no, you
know, mistakes in life.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.970 align:middle line:84%
If you-- with me
in that situation,

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I did everything that I could
to stop that from happening.

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I went to the meetings
that they wanted me to do.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.280 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: You tried to
progress and be a good doctor.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yeah.

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:40.390 align:middle line:90%
And they still happen.

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I, just in the moment
that that happened, I went,

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.625 align:middle line:90%
there's something in this.

00:50:44.625 --> 00:50:46.730 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
the making of me.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.225 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you needed
those disciplines.

00:50:48.225 --> 00:50:49.645 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.
-You needed the education.

00:50:49.645 --> 00:50:50.844 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: Absolutely.

00:50:50.844 --> 00:50:53.494 align:middle line:84%
You needed the understanding
of the human body.

00:50:53.494 --> 00:50:54.660 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON:
Yes, yeah.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because that is
studying the material aspect.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:59.450 align:middle line:90%
And you needed that knowledge.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:01.340 align:middle line:90%
It's such a great foundation.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, to every single
moment that I bring in my life

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:07.620 align:middle line:84%
now, the fact that
I've done a Saturday

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.240 align:middle line:84%
night in a busy
emergency room, you know,

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.570 align:middle line:84%
that comes in to
everything that I do.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a foundation.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So everything happened
in the perfect moment.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So what this really means for
everyone is that your future's

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:24.090 align:middle line:84%
already happened,
which is why you

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:26.702 align:middle line:90%
can at all predict the future.

00:51:26.702 --> 00:51:29.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, so that means,
although your ego self may not

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:33.101 align:middle line:84%
know, every single choice that
you make is the right one,

00:51:33.101 --> 00:51:35.700 align:middle line:84%
you know.
So you can have no regrets.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.871 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is
unfolding absolutely perfectly.

00:51:38.871 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, with that, let me
play devil's advocate.

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain
to us how this works.

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's say-- you listened.

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:51.640 align:middle line:84%
You listened to
yourself, which is,

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to go to medical school.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be a doctor.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And you did that.
You listened.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.640 align:middle line:90%
You were driven toward that.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Other people wake
up, maybe, one day

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and say they know that,
say, a relationship is over.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.990 align:middle line:84%
They're getting the
signal loud and clear.

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:11.720 align:middle line:90%
They can feel that that's right.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But they decide, no, no,
no, I don't want to do that.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It's too messy, inconvenient.

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:19.860 align:middle line:90%
It would be painful.

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.590 align:middle line:84%
For all these reasons,
they decide not

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:23.910 align:middle line:90%
to listen to that voice inside.

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And the question
would be, are you

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.990 align:middle line:84%
saying that the predisposition
to have made that decision not

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:34.070 align:middle line:84%
to listen to the
higher self would have

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:36.610 align:middle line:84%
already played out in
the other dimensions

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:38.604 align:middle line:90%
for a specific outcome?

00:52:38.604 --> 00:52:39.570 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yes.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And so all the trouble and
strife that we see in life that

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:84%
people go through which can
take them down to the ground

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.544 align:middle line:84%
into addictive behaviors,
and so on, that the soul

00:52:50.544 --> 00:52:51.510 align:middle line:90%
has chosen that for purpose--

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:52.950 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON:
Why would they choose that?

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:55.217 align:middle line:84%
Because in that,
there's a learning.

00:52:55.217 --> 00:52:55.950 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:52:55.950 --> 00:53:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So say you don't listen
to your intuition.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:03.140 align:middle line:84%
A good example--
yesterday, I had

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:07.410 align:middle line:84%
an intuition to go to-- come
down to a certain-- drive

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:08.700 align:middle line:90%
a certain route.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't listen to it.

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:11.450 align:middle line:90%
I went down another route.

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up in
a really big jam.

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was going, OK,
this is a great situation

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:18.890 align:middle line:90%
to illustrate that.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt the
lesson of having not

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.490 align:middle line:84%
listened to that voice,
which is perfect.

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:26.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what I need--
I needed to get the

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.660 align:middle line:90%
of not listening to the voice.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So all of that is part
of the c squared region.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So once you realize that
even something that appears

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.700 align:middle line:84%
a mistake is actually
perfect because you get--

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.990 align:middle line:84%
you feel the dissonance
of not having

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.780 align:middle line:90%
listened to your intuition.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling,
the dissonance,

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:49.640 align:middle line:84%
is what you were already
meant to have experienced.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the lesson,
feeling the dissonance

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and not listening
to your inner voice.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And people might be thinking,
well, what's the point, then?

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.720 align:middle line:84%
What's the point of
even listening to this?

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.090 align:middle line:84%
What's the point of getting
into your genius groove?

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:03.944 align:middle line:90%
Some people--

00:54:03.944 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:84%
What's the point of
getting up in the morning?

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:07.160 align:middle line:84%
What's the point of
getting up in the morn--

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:11.410 align:middle line:84%
some people will be hearing
this and be inspired.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And some people
won't be bothered.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
they've chosen.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Some people will
never decide to go

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:21.950 align:middle line:84%
for any personal growth in
their life in this incarnation.

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:23.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine, too.

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.680 align:middle line:90%
That's also what they've chosen.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a myriad of
different choices

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that people have
at a soul level.

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And each one is
playing out perfectly.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we are all
aspects of the god

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.640 align:middle line:84%
consciousness experiencing
lots of things.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:42.661 align:middle line:84%
And so some people will never,
you know, go to a, you know,

00:54:42.661 --> 00:54:46.030 align:middle line:84%
a channeling or a workshop
or do that personal growth.

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.877 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:54:46.877 --> 00:54:48.510 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON:
And that's perfect, too.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me that
the reality is also--

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:90%
it's all one in the same.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.700 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:55:00.100 align:middle line:84%
You still have to live your
mirrored, positive time frame

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:00.800 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.510 align:middle line:90%
MANJIR SAMANTA-LAUGHTON: Yeah.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether it already exists
in this mirrored universe

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:09.380 align:middle line:84%
is comforting to know in our
other dimensional aspect.

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But you still have
to play the game.

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:13.285 align:middle line:84%
You still have to go through
and make your decisions--

00:55:13.285 --> 00:55:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you do.

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.010 align:middle line:84%
 --and commit yourself
to this or that,

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:19.590 align:middle line:84%
or not, and learn what it feels
like not to have done that.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:23.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't absolve us of any
participation in the creation

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:24.640 align:middle line:90%
of our life, still.

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.640 align:middle line:84%
No, you still have to
listen to your heart

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.640 align:middle line:90%
to see what's right for you.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.010 align:middle line:10%
But the difference and
the liberation in this

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:34.360 align:middle line:10%
is that every decision, once
you get your mind around this,

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.970 align:middle line:10%
is that every
decision, you know,

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:37.430 align:middle line:10%
is going to be the right one.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:40.660 align:middle line:10%
And it means that there
aren't those regrets there

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.780 align:middle line:10%
and that your life is unfolding.

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:44.840 align:middle line:10%
And it also has a
huge implication

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.410 align:middle line:10%
for law of attraction.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone's trying
to manifest, manifest.

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But they're manifesting
from their ego self.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
Exactly.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:54.130 align:middle line:90%
I've written about this, too.

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:55.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:55.300 --> 00:56:00.885 align:middle line:84%
So you know, when they realize
that their reality is created

00:56:00.885 --> 00:56:04.540 align:middle line:84%
on a very, very deep level
from them, their higher aspect,

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:07.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of fighting against
their reality and saying,

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:08.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't like my life.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll manifest a
different one, which is what,

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.270 align:middle line:84%
basically, people
are saying when

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:middle line:84%
they're approaching
law of attraction,

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.200 align:middle line:90%
especially at the beginning.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.280 align:middle line:84%
That's effectively what
they're telling themselves.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.140 align:middle line:84%
To actually accept
that, actually,

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:26.490 align:middle line:84%
my higher self has created
this moment right now-- why--

00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and look into the
reasons why and look

00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:30.490 align:middle line:90%
into why you are actually--

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:31.930 align:middle line:90%
You just hit it.

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:35.090 align:middle line:84%
That's really it, is, rather
than trying to fantasize

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and grow into someone
else's life, per se,

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:38.260 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't mean we can't create.

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
we can't create

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in a bountiful,
beautiful manner.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But to look at where
you are right now

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and ask yourself, what's the
potential of learning here,

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:50.810 align:middle line:84%
doesn't that seem to
be the-- that's it.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:51.510 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are creating
from a place of avoidance

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.890 align:middle line:90%
of their situation right now.

00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And m, it should be
an integrated process.

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And once you realize
that, then you

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:06.450 align:middle line:84%
can start to go through
this process of surrender

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to higher self, where you
are going with the flow--

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you're maybe
listening more often so you

00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.300 align:middle line:90%
don't end up in a traffic jam.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, isn't that the
idea of going through life

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:17.930 align:middle line:90%
of refining and refining--

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:19.030 align:middle line:84%
MANJIR SAMANTA
LAUGHTON: Exactly.

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:23.461 align:middle line:84%
 --and experiencing more joy,
more freedom, more creativity?

00:57:23.461 --> 00:57:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Since I have surrendered--
gone through that process

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:31.090 align:middle line:84%
of surrender of going, you
know, my intellectual ego

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:35.610 align:middle line:84%
self doesn't understand
the situation, but I will--

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I understand there's
a bigger picture here,

00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that process of surrender
has brought me into such

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:42.450 align:middle line:90%
a more expansive life.

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what I'm
doing week to week, you know.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's the higher self and
the flow that is now leading me.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing
that's happening

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.860 align:middle line:84%
is energy is melting
behind your work.

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.360 align:middle line:84%
You have lots of
requests for interviews.

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And also-- I just
want to sneak this

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:00.300 align:middle line:84%
in right now--
"The Genius Groove"

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.860 align:middle line:90%
is now an online course.

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, excellent.

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:08.660 align:middle line:84%
That will be a multi-media
course with videos from myself.

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be options
to have personal tutoring.

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:12.800 align:middle line:84%
It's through, you know,
getting into your groove

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.430 align:middle line:84%
wherever you are in the world
because it's all online.

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, how to get your
life to-- to be more groovy.

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:20.930 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And everybody could
use a little groove.

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Manjir, I want to thank
you so much for taking

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.240 align:middle line:84%
the time to spend with us here
and coming down to Winchester.

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.350 align:middle line:90%
It's been great, as always.

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you.

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:31.120 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Thank you.

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:50.900 align:middle line:90%
