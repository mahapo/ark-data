00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.317 align:middle line:90%
This is Lisa Garr.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.152 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.855 align:middle line:84%
We are coming to you live
from Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.757 align:middle line:84%
And since this a live
show, we encourage

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.226 align:middle line:84%
you to interact with us

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.594 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have
already started,

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.396 align:middle line:84%
so keep those

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.598 align:middle line:84%
We'll answer your questions

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.901 align:middle line:84%
So if you've ever been
one of those persons

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.471 align:middle line:84%

about the passing of a loved

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.707 align:middle line:84%
one, or if you've ever been
at the bedside of someone who

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.844 align:middle line:84%
has passed over,
this show is for you.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.946 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
conversation that

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:49.316 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Raymond Moody has
dedicated his life to,

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.785 align:middle line:84%
is helping people
in this situation.

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:55.255 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moody is the author of a
book called "Life After Life,"

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.791 align:middle line:90%
which is in its 37th year.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.193 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people
have read his book.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:03.063 align:middle line:84%
And he also has a new book
out called "Paranormal:

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.299 align:middle line:84%
My Life in the Pursuit
of the Afterlife."

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.334 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining me, Dr. Moody.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:08.702 align:middle line:84%
>>RAYMOND MOODY:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:10.003 align:middle line:90%
I'm just delighted to be here.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And thanks also to our
viewers who are watching.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.274 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.076 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
very, very curious

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:21.648 align:middle line:84%
about this concept of life after
death, near-death experiences.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.717 align:middle line:90%
Is there life after death?

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.352 align:middle line:84%
How did you come
to write the book

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:28.355 align:middle line:90%
37 years ago about this concept?

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:30.123 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I was
one of those kids who

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.959 align:middle line:90%
just wasn't raised religious.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.661 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to the
University of Virginia

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.997 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 18
to study astronomy,

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.834 align:middle line:84%
actually-- but I'd been
interested in philosophy

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:41.668 align:middle line:90%
in high school.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:46.773 align:middle line:84%
And literally in my first few
days as a first-year student

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:50.077 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Virginia in 1962,

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:54.648 align:middle line:84%
reading Plato's "Republic" was
where I became aware of this.

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:57.616 align:middle line:84%
Because Plato's
"Republic" is about

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.786 align:middle line:84%
the question of
life after death.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.956 align:middle line:84%
And it culminates with
this amazing story

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.492 align:middle line:84%
of a warrior who
was believed dead.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:08.996 align:middle line:84%
But during the funeral,
he spontaneously revived.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:90%
And he sat up.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.033 align:middle line:84%
And he talked to his friends
about leaving his body

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:16.803 align:middle line:84%
and going through a passageway
into another world where

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.373 align:middle line:90%
he saw his life reviewed.

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:21.508 align:middle line:84%
And I was very impressed
with that story.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:25.412 align:middle line:84%
And I was absolutely
persuaded at age 18

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:29.916 align:middle line:84%
by Plato's argument,
who said that this

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:33.453 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
question of existence.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.656 align:middle line:84%
Then three years
later, still at UVA

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.159 align:middle line:84%
as an undergraduate
philosophy student,

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.696 align:middle line:84%
I heard about Dr. George
Ritchie, who was at that time

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:46.266 align:middle line:84%
a professor of psychiatry at
the University of Virginia,

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:50.137 align:middle line:84%
who some years before had had
this very experience in which

00:02:50.137 --> 00:02:53.406 align:middle line:84%
he had been pronounced
dead on two occasions, nine

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:57.978 align:middle line:84%
minutes apart, and had this
phenomenal experience where--

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:01.648 align:middle line:84%
listening to Doctor Ritchie
tell about this experience

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.951 align:middle line:84%
was a life-changing
event in my life.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:08.155 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story
short, since that time,

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I've had the privilege,
as it really is,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.193 align:middle line:84%
of interviewing
literally thousands--

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.063 align:middle line:84%
I'm not exaggerating--
thousands of people

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:19.366 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world who
went to the brink of death

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.069 align:middle line:84%
and who had this
amazing experience.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.304 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does this
information, all these people

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:27.207 align:middle line:84%
that you've interviewed
about near-death experiences,

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.411 align:middle line:84%
how does that help the person
who has lost a loved one?

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.914 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, doctors
all over the world

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:36.116 align:middle line:84%
had studied these
near-death experiences.

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:38.985 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
is that, for people

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:41.288 align:middle line:84%
who haven't had
such an experience,

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:44.024 align:middle line:84%
it really does seem to
be comforting to them

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:50.497 align:middle line:84%
to hear these stories of people
who almost die and recover.

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:53.767 align:middle line:84%
And also, I think
that for people

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:57.037 align:middle line:84%
who are terminally ill,
that these stories are

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:59.305 align:middle line:90%
very comforting.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:04.144 align:middle line:84%
Because generally what people
who almost die and recover

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
tell us was that, far from
being a bad experience,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.917 align:middle line:84%
it was in effect the
highlight of their life.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.553 align:middle line:84%
They say they enter into
an entirely different realm

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:14.621 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.422 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:15.922 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.059 align:middle line:84%
I have been through one
of these experiences

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:23.263 align:middle line:84%
where I was in a severe
accident and left my body

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.299 align:middle line:84%
and went up over the scene
and saw and felt and heard

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.135 align:middle line:84%
all of the feelings of
the people below me,

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:31.471 align:middle line:84%
and watched my body and
watched all the people.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:36.076 align:middle line:84%
It was the most extraordinary
experience I've ever had.

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:39.513 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it
clearly, so clearly.

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.114 align:middle line:90%
I was far from unconscious.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.217 align:middle line:84%
I was more conscious
than I ever, ever was.

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:46.253 align:middle line:84%
It was an expanded
consciousness.

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:46.786 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:47.687 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.223 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're going
to go through today some

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.792 align:middle line:84%
of the classic characteristics
that Dr. Moody has

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.395 align:middle line:84%
so eloquently put into
place for people like me

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:57.998 align:middle line:84%
and anyone else who's had
an experience like this,

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:00.834 align:middle line:84%
to be able to identify
with that experience that

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:05.772 align:middle line:84%
was so mysterious to me
that I had no words for it--

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.474 align:middle line:84%
I still struggle
to find words for--

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.509 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually one
of the characteristics.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.511 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
through these in detail.

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:13.346 align:middle line:84%
So if you've ever
been though this,

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.248 align:middle line:84%
you have a way to
identify with this.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:16.983 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you
haven't been through it,

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.686 align:middle line:84%
you understand a little
bit more about what

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:24.357 align:middle line:84%
happens to people who go through
this, quote, tunnel of death.

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:29.796 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip to show you that
kind of encapsulates what--

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.965 align:middle line:84%
from a movie called
"Life After Life" that

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:34.367 align:middle line:84%
was made after Dr.
Raymond Moody's book.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.437 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.629 align:middle line:84%
which we're going
to go through today.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:26.733 align:middle line:84%
But it was so healing for me to
identify with that and to see--

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.701 align:middle line:84%
And I wound up
taking your course

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:29.869 align:middle line:90%
through my master's program.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.638 align:middle line:84%
And it was very,
very enlightening.

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:34.207 align:middle line:84%
So let's go through some
of the characteristics.

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:34.741 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.209 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is
the typical, like--

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:37.343 align:middle line:90%
this is general, of course.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:39.012 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the same
for everyone, right?

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.484 align:middle line:84%
People go into this
more deeply the longer

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:46.419 align:middle line:90%
they're close to death.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.889 align:middle line:84%
So that someone who has
an extended cardiac arrest

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.859 align:middle line:84%
is more likely to tell
you this whole picture.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Whereas somebody, for example,
with only momentary cardiac

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.833 align:middle line:84%
arrest will just tell you one
or two or three of these things.

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:03.536 align:middle line:84%
But in the typical case
we've seen many times,

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:06.639 align:middle line:84%
people will tell us that at this
point where their heart stops

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.843 align:middle line:84%
beating, they actually
hear their doctor say,

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:12.979 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, he's dead,
or words to that effect.

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:15.215 align:middle line:84%
Which comes as a big
surprise to them,

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:18.618 align:middle line:84%
because they say, as you
did, that paradoxically, I've

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
heard people say,
I've never felt

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.457 align:middle line:84%
so alive as when I heard
my doctor say I was dead.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.592 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can't say it.

00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:26.226 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:28.995 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And people
say that they rise up.

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:31.965 align:middle line:84%
They see their own
physical bodies down below.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.067 align:middle line:84%
They watch as the
doctors and nurses

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:36.336 align:middle line:90%
are trying to resuscitate them.

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:39.706 align:middle line:84%
But after a while on this,
it kind of dawns on them, oh,

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:42.642 align:middle line:84%
that since I'm out of my
body, nobody can see me.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:43.643 align:middle line:90%
I try to talk.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.044 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can hear me.

00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:46.513 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
sense of surrender.

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:47.046 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:47.814 align:middle line:90%
Surrender.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.116 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
they tell us they

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:52.118 align:middle line:84%
enter into states
of consciousness

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:55.388 align:middle line:84%
that, no matter how
articulate they may be

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:58.658 align:middle line:84%
or how many languages
they may speak, they say

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.828 align:middle line:84%
they simply have no
words to describe this,

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.464 align:middle line:90%
that it lies beyond words.

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:06.032 align:middle line:84%
But the way they
try to describe it,

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:09.536 align:middle line:84%
they say they go through
a passageway, which

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:12.605 align:middle line:84%
they may compare to
a tunnel or a tube.

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:14.874 align:middle line:84%
And they say they come
out on the other side

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
of this passageway in an
incredibly brilliant light,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.317 align:middle line:84%
far brighter than anything that
we have seen while we're alive.

00:11:24.317 --> 00:11:25.852 align:middle line:90%
But it's not uncomfortable.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:28.254 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, the reverse.

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:32.992 align:middle line:84%
They feel completely
comforted, at peace, joyful,

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:37.764 align:middle line:84%
and pervaded by this amazing
love, far beyond the love

00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%
that we feel while we're here.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.004 align:middle line:84%
And in that light, they tell
us that relatives or friends

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:47.173 align:middle line:84%
of theirs who have
already died seem

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:49.175 align:middle line:84%
to be there almost as
a greeting committee,

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%

this transition.

is sequential-- that
when they tell this,

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.874 align:middle line:84%
they have to tell it as
though it were a sequence.

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:25.211 align:middle line:84%
That in the experiencing

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.212 align:middle line:90%

>>MOODY: Yep.

00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:32.051 align:middle line:84%
And they say that in
this panorama, when

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.954 align:middle line:84%
you see yourself
doing an action,

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:39.659 align:middle line:84%
that you see yourself as
though you're another person.

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:44.163 align:middle line:84%
But when that action has its
impact or its consequences,

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:46.199 align:middle line:84%
you are embedded in
the consciousness

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:48.635 align:middle line:84%
of those with whom
you've interacted.

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%

yourself doing something

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.606 align:middle line:84%
mean to somebody,
then in this review

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:57.276 align:middle line:84%
you feel empathically

They tell us that at this
point where their doctor says

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.684 align:middle line:84%
they are dead, that
they may actually

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:41.187 align:middle line:84%
hear the physician
say, oh my, he's dead,

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:44.057 align:middle line:84%
or we've lost her, or
something like that.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:46.225 align:middle line:84%
And they say that from
their perspective, actually,

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:48.061 align:middle line:90%
they still feel very much alive.

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:50.797 align:middle line:84%
Indeed their consciousness
is heightened.

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And they tell us that they seem
to leave their physical bodies.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
They say that they
float up, typically

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.074 align:middle line:84%
right above the bed in the

your body and when you're
just projecting or floating

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.597 align:middle line:84%
above your body in

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:26.032 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference there?

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:28.034 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, that's a
great question, Heather.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:32.905 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here is
a continuum or a spectrum

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:35.308 align:middle line:84%
rather than a
discrete difference.

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:37.376 align:middle line:84%
And the experience
you're describing

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:41.047 align:middle line:84%
there of leaving the body
occurs, as you're intimating,

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:45.618 align:middle line:84%
not just in the case of somebody
who almost dies and recovers,

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:47.253 align:middle line:90%
but other cases as well.

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, you mentioned
the meditative state.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.693 align:middle line:84%
And also the out-of-body
experiences sometimes

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
occur to music performers
while they're on stage.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.698 align:middle line:84%

there's a difference

00:14:58.698 --> 00:15:01.601 align:middle line:84%
between a near-death experience

00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:02.769 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Well, I think, yes.

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:05.338 align:middle line:84%
The out-of-body
experience is something

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:09.108 align:middle line:84%
that occurs sometimes in
a near-death experience

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:12.512 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes in other cases,
like performing great music.

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:16.749 align:middle line:84%
Or astronomers occasionally
gazing through their telescopes

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.951 align:middle line:84%
will have out-of-body
experiences.

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.555 align:middle line:84%
And so it occurs
not just in the case

00:15:22.555 --> 00:15:25.925 align:middle line:84%
of a near-death experience,
but also in these other cases.

be replicated yet,
but parts of it.

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:48.781 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
ways, for example,

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.384 align:middle line:84%
of inducing an
out-of-body state.

00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:55.388 align:middle line:84%
And another
circumstance in which

00:15:55.388 --> 00:16:00.293 align:middle line:84%
people without almost dying
can have these experiences

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.429 align:middle line:84%
is at the bedside of
someone who does die.

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:07.567 align:middle line:84%
It's very common, for
example, when somebody dies,

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:10.837 align:middle line:84%
and the loved ones are standing
around as the person in the bed

00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:14.907 align:middle line:84%
dies, the bystanders themselves
may have all of these features

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:17.476 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about as a
near-death experience,

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:20.947 align:middle line:84%
including seeing the spirit
of the departing person

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:22.281 align:middle line:90%
leave the body.

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:26.619 align:middle line:84%
Or in many cases, the bystanders
will say that they themselves

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:28.588 align:middle line:84%

For instance, my friend Kim, who
works at a medical university

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:02.982 align:middle line:84%
out west, was
telling me that she

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:08.621 align:middle line:84%
was involved in resuscitating
a young patient named Maria.

00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:12.725 align:middle line:84%
And Maria had been believed dead
but was successfully revived.

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:15.895 align:middle line:84%
And when she came
back to consciousness,

00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:21.434 align:middle line:84%
my friend Kim happened to be
standing there by her bedside.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:26.639 align:middle line:84%
And Maria grabbed onto Kim and
said during the resuscitation,

00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:28.874 align:middle line:84%
when she was out
of her body, she

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:32.311 align:middle line:84%
drifted outside of the hospital
entirely and saw an old shoe

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:37.249 align:middle line:84%
on a ledge on a window outside
an upper floor of the hospital.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:39.418 align:middle line:84%
And Kim was actually
able to go there

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:42.955 align:middle line:84%
and to verify that
the shoe was there

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:46.192 align:middle line:84%
exactly as the
patient had specified.

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:47.994 align:middle line:90%
>>Really.

00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:51.697 align:middle line:84%
>>And all of a sudden, aware
of people out in the hall.

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.799 align:middle line:84%
The room had been
sealed off because he

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:57.737 align:middle line:84%
was going to do
surgery in the room.

00:18:57.737 --> 00:19:02.074 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately went
out through the door.

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.776 align:middle line:90%
Did not open it, just went out.

00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:07.613 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately on the
other side of it, in the hall.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:10.383 align:middle line:90%
But I go up to my daughter.

00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:13.919 align:middle line:84%
And I try to make her hear
me, "Kathy, go home and change

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.154 align:middle line:90%
your clothes."

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.624 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make her hear
me, so I went to her dad.

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:20.292 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Jud, take Kathy home.

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.093 align:middle line:90%
Change her clothes.

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:23.496 align:middle line:90%
She shouldn't be out like this."

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
While they were
in the hall there

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.237 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to send them
home, a brother of my husband's

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:31.771 align:middle line:90%
came up.

00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:34.306 align:middle line:90%
And he was talking to him.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.876 align:middle line:90%
And he had gotten word to come.

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:40.346 align:middle line:84%
And one of his neighbors
was also in the hospital.

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:44.417 align:middle line:84%
And he came up and started
talking to my brother and all,

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:47.386 align:middle line:84%
wanting to know what he
was doing at the hospital

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.955 align:middle line:84%
and what he was going
to do that weekend.

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:52.425 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well, it looks
like my sister-in-law

00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:53.793 align:middle line:90%
is gonna kick the bucket.

00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:56.162 align:middle line:84%
And I was planning
to go to Athens.

00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:59.598 align:middle line:84%
But I'll stick around
now to be a pallbearer."

00:19:59.598 --> 00:20:02.968 align:middle line:84%
Later I was also
able to talk to him.

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:04.904 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to
admit it, but he

00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:08.174 align:middle line:84%
did admit that this
is what he had said.

00:20:08.174 --> 00:20:09.308 align:middle line:90%
And I laughed at him.

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Because it embarrassed him.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.614 align:middle line:84%
>>It was amazing that I was
never leaving my body, too.

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:18.884 align:middle line:84%
I was everywhere who
thought about me.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:21.053 align:middle line:90%
But I was with my body.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:25.357 align:middle line:84%
It means that I was not leaving
the one part for another.

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:28.494 align:middle line:90%
I was everywhere the same time.

00:20:28.494 --> 00:20:29.662 align:middle line:90%
I could be in New York.

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:32.431 align:middle line:90%
I could be in Longview, Texas.

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.066 align:middle line:90%
I could be in Moscow.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:37.436 align:middle line:84%
I could be in Tbilisi,
Georgia-- in any place.

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:40.773 align:middle line:84%

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:38.444 align:middle line:84%
well there are
several difficulties

00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:39.878 align:middle line:90%
with that position.

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:43.649 align:middle line:84%
Number one is that
I don't know anybody

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:46.552 align:middle line:84%
who makes that statement
who's really had experience

00:24:46.552 --> 00:24:48.287 align:middle line:90%
interviewing patients.

00:24:48.287 --> 00:24:50.255 align:middle line:84%
What they do is
they read something

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:51.824 align:middle line:84%
in a magazine or
a book, and then

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:56.462 align:middle line:84%
they just speculate and put it
together with their ideology.

00:24:56.462 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
People who interview
people, who've

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.333 align:middle line:84%
interviewed lots of
people, as a general rule,

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:03.602 align:middle line:84%
come to a very different
opinion that this

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:08.207 align:middle line:84%
is something beyond our
current explanatory models.

00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:16.648 align:middle line:84%
But I think, more importantly,
that the identical experience

00:25:16.648 --> 00:25:18.984 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
near-death experience also

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:23.989 align:middle line:84%
occurs to the bystanders at the
bedside when somebody does die.

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:25.824 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The shared death
really does give it

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:26.625 align:middle line:90%
a different perspective.

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:27.359 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:27.893 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:29.862 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And so if the
bystanders, who are not

00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:32.965 align:middle line:84%
ill or injured and the
oxygen flow to their brain

00:25:32.965 --> 00:25:37.736 align:middle line:84%
is not compromised, and yet they
report the identical experience

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:42.074 align:middle line:84%
to those who are revived
after a close call with death,

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:45.511 align:middle line:84%
then obviously the cause is
not the oxygen deprivation

00:25:45.511 --> 00:25:46.145 align:middle line:90%
to the brain.

00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:47.846 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the
shared death experience

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:50.549 align:middle line:84%
does really kind of
back that up a lot more,

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.185 align:middle line:84%
as we just saw on that
clip, with people around,

00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:57.556 align:middle line:84%
and the evidence of what's
experienced on the outside.

00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:00.492 align:middle line:84%
So when you-- you
had mentioned to me

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that there's a new science
that's really emerging that'll

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
help us understand
this a lot more.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.301 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:13.238 align:middle line:84%
What I am-- by the
way, I am a logician.

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:16.675 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to draw
conclusions, in the sense

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:90%
that I think-- why hurry?

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.815 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I am very conservative
in my pronouncements.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.289 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, in
the last year or so

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:31.757 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten up to
the point where

00:26:31.757 --> 00:26:34.693 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely
confident to say now

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that we have made a solid
step of genuine progress

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
toward rational comprehension
of life after death.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.807 align:middle line:84%
So that what I am saying is
that in the next few years

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:53.846 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have entirely
new, purely, absolutely

00:26:53.846 --> 00:26:57.449 align:middle line:84%
rational techniques,
not pseudoscience.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:01.253 align:middle line:84%

I am not a parapsychologist.

00:27:01.253 --> 00:27:01.854 align:middle line:90%

My guest is Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:51.169 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
near-death experience

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:54.506 align:middle line:84%
and classic characteristics
of the near-death experience.

about the new sciences
that are emerging.

>>MOODY: Yes.

This is very complex,
Lisa, but just

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:84%
to give you a
thumbnail sketch of it,

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.853 align:middle line:84%
we have now techniques
where we can actually

reformat people's minds, for

00:28:12.491 --> 00:28:13.659 align:middle line:90%

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:22.367 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, it's
basically through exercises

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:26.238 align:middle line:84%
and to sort of eliminate an
incompleteness in Aristotelian

00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:27.139 align:middle line:90%
logic.

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:30.342 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle's logic is
built into all of us

00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:32.311 align:middle line:90%
because it's been so successful.

00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:34.846 align:middle line:84%
But there was an area
where he sort of left out.

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.582 align:middle line:90%
Now we've filled this in.

00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:40.185 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
we can help people

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
get better analytical thinking
skills and many other benefits

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.759 align:middle line:84%
by this sort of
reformatting of the mind.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:51.964 align:middle line:84%
Now, what will happen
is that, once that

00:28:51.964 --> 00:28:54.733 align:middle line:84%
happens, and say you have
several thousand people who

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.970 align:middle line:84%
are working-- equipped
with a new logic,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.107 align:middle line:84%
in essence, then what's going to
happen with that is that when,

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
just by chance, in the
future some of them

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.279 align:middle line:84%
will have near-death
experiences,

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and so they're
going to come back,

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.349 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
going to be limited

00:29:10.349 --> 00:29:13.385 align:middle line:84%
by this problem of
the indescribability

00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:14.052 align:middle line:90%
as the same way.

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:17.456 align:middle line:84%
So in effect, we can
prepare people's minds

00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:20.425 align:middle line:84%
to articulate this in
such a way as to bring

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:23.261 align:middle line:84%
us closer to the
experience itself.

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:26.531 align:middle line:84%
And also we can use
this same information

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:31.203 align:middle line:84%

people and the dying process

to the other side.

I have observed over the years

00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:17.869 align:middle line:84%
that I think is pretty much
clear about these experiences

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:20.238 align:middle line:84%
is that they do
give people comfort

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:21.973 align:middle line:90%
who've lost loved ones to death.

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.341 align:middle line:90%
That is the fact.

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:24.276 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:27.746 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, first
of all, for many people

00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:30.916 align:middle line:84%
this whole idea of an afterlife
is something vague and abstract

00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:33.418 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they encounter
in their religious belief,

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:90%
but it's not filled out.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.858 align:middle line:84%
But this, from people
who actually got there

00:32:39.858 --> 00:32:44.196 align:middle line:84%
to the cusp of the other world
and are able to talk about even

00:32:44.196 --> 00:32:47.132 align:middle line:84%
then they felt great, and
there was this love and so on.

00:32:47.132 --> 00:32:49.668 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
comforting message

00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:52.003 align:middle line:84%
to people who've
lost loved ones.

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:57.042 align:middle line:84%
That said, I must go on
to say that, you know,

00:32:57.042 --> 00:33:00.779 align:middle line:84%
even people who've had profound
near-death experiences, they

00:33:00.779 --> 00:33:03.014 align:middle line:84%
say that when they lose
a loved one to death,

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:04.382 align:middle line:90%
they still miss them.

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:05.383 align:middle line:90%

>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:09.387 align:middle line:84%
But it does give, I
think, people a comfort

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:13.024 align:middle line:84%
to realize that in the future
they're going to be reunited

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:15.093 align:middle line:84%

they lost to death.

panorama of your life

00:33:32.744 --> 00:33:36.748 align:middle line:84%
as like a still pond, and
each action in your life

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:39.818 align:middle line:84%

you flip into that pond.

At the point where that
pebble impacts on the surface,

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.655 align:middle line:90%

ripples and this panorama

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:54.132 align:middle line:84%
impinge on others, then you can
see the secondary effects going

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:56.768 align:middle line:84%
off from those people
in the form of ripples.

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:57.269 align:middle line:90%
>>I see.

00:33:57.269 --> 00:34:00.472 align:middle line:84%
>>So I think it
illustrates how tied in we

00:34:00.472 --> 00:34:03.875 align:middle line:84%
all are to one another in
this life, how profoundly

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:08.013 align:middle line:84%
our actions and our
feelings affect others.

00:34:08.013 --> 00:34:11.315 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in this life
review we're made aware of that

00:34:11.315 --> 00:34:12.984 align:middle line:90%
in a very profound way.

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:13.752 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:18.422 align:middle line:84%
>>And people say, too, that
it's not the events in your life

00:34:18.422 --> 00:34:21.626 align:middle line:84%
that you would necessarily
expect which get reviewed.

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.862 align:middle line:84%
It's not the big
accomplishments, but rather

00:34:23.862 --> 00:34:26.697 align:middle line:84%
the simple acts of
kindness, often things

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:84%

We-- studies have shown that
the near-death experiences

of suicide attempters are no
different from those of people

that were done of this,

00:34:57.329 --> 00:34:58.997 align:middle line:84%
they interviewed
all the patients

who came into the hospital
over a period of time

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:02.968 align:middle line:84%

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:08.139 align:middle line:84%
almost died as a

afterward, they found a
remarkable occurrence.

00:35:19.651 --> 00:35:23.088 align:middle line:84%
And that is that while
the patients who did not

00:35:23.088 --> 00:35:26.157 align:middle line:84%
have a near-death
experience continued

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:28.526 align:middle line:84%
to have a high rate
of subsequent attempts

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:31.129 align:middle line:84%
to kill themselves,
the patients who did

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:35.333 align:middle line:84%
have a near-death experience
had an essentially zero rate

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:37.769 align:middle line:84%
of any further attempts
to kill themselves.

00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:40.305 align:middle line:84%
And when interviewed
about this, what they said

00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:44.075 align:middle line:84%
was not that they felt that,
had this gone to completion,

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:46.878 align:middle line:84%
they would have ended
up in a terrible hell,

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:50.048 align:middle line:84%
but rather, that they
learned from their experience

00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:54.352 align:middle line:84%
that even when times are
tough, life has a purpose.

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And also they realized that,
had this gone to completion,

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.759 align:middle line:84%
they would have had to

the experience you're

relating there is
just very common.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.752 align:middle line:84%
That it's a very
common phenomenon

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:37.989 align:middle line:84%
that within a certain period of
time after the death of a loved

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.592 align:middle line:84%
one, that people
will have what are

00:37:40.592 --> 00:37:42.827 align:middle line:90%
called apparitional experiences.

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:46.297 align:middle line:84%
And these occur in
three circumstances.

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:51.035 align:middle line:84%
One, as in the description
you're giving there, a dream.

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:53.605 align:middle line:84%
Now, often-- I don't
know about your case,

00:37:53.605 --> 00:37:56.040 align:middle line:84%
but very often people
tell me that they

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.145 align:middle line:84%
have to call it a dream
because they were asleep.

00:38:00.145 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't seem like a dream.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.616 align:middle line:90%
It had the quality of reality.

00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:07.519 align:middle line:84%
Another kind of common
locale for apparitions

00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:10.588 align:middle line:84%
is people will say that as
they're in the bed at night

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:12.123 align:middle line:84%
and they're still
awake, but they

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:15.226 align:middle line:84%
see the apparition of
the deceased person

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:17.162 align:middle line:90%
there at their bedside.

00:38:17.162 --> 00:38:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
group are people

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.999 align:middle line:84%
who say that in the middle
of the day, when they're

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:24.903 align:middle line:84%
fully conscious and
in waking awareness,

00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:27.438 align:middle line:84%
that they have apparitions
of the deceased.

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:30.008 align:middle line:84%
So the experience
you're describing

00:38:30.008 --> 00:38:32.610 align:middle line:84%

What I think is going on here
is there's a kind of continuum.

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:57.328 align:middle line:84%
And I mean a
ruptured appendix-- I

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:59.864 align:middle line:84%
don't know what your doctors
might have told you about that,

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:02.533 align:middle line:84%
but that's a
dangerous situation.

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:06.604 align:middle line:84%
And you were in very grave
states at that point.

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:09.641 align:middle line:84%
So you know, this
is a continuum.

00:40:09.641 --> 00:40:17.048 align:middle line:84%
And people who, as the
call is-- the closer you

00:40:17.048 --> 00:40:21.719 align:middle line:84%
get to this death, the
more elements of these

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:22.353 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.390 align:middle line:90%
There's kind of continuum.

states, as you're describing,

00:40:30.328 --> 00:40:32.597 align:middle line:84%

Well, there's an
overarching theme here.

00:40:36.234 --> 00:40:39.203 align:middle line:84%
And basically it's--
what is this teaching us?

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:43.641 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose of these
experiences and sharing them

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:44.409 align:middle line:90%
with other people?

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:46.711 align:middle line:90%

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:01.392 align:middle line:84%

Like me, it's knowledge.

00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:07.765 align:middle line:84%
Some people chase
power or fame or money

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.167 align:middle line:90%
or any of these other things.

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:11.536 align:middle line:84%
But when people come
back from this, whatever

00:41:11.536 --> 00:41:14.105 align:middle line:84%
they were chasing,
they say what this

00:41:14.105 --> 00:41:17.008 align:middle line:84%
is all about is
learning to love.

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:21.045 align:middle line:84%
Because they say that's
what came up in this review

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is that the most important thing
we can do while we're alive

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.886 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to love,
which is not an easy task.

me that in the closing

moments of their life, that
so many people come back

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:51.676 align:middle line:84%
reporting that what was most
important to them at this time

00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:55.046 align:middle line:84%
was love, the
question of how they

00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:57.281 align:middle line:84%
had loved their
fellow human beings.

00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:00.084 align:middle line:84%
>>It had a lot of effects
in changing my life.

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:04.288 align:middle line:84%
It's made me a more
understanding person of others.

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:07.058 align:middle line:84%
I know I don't have the
right to take my life.

00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:08.993 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to return.

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:10.895 align:middle line:90%
And I would love to go back.

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Someday I will.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:16.067 align:middle line:84%
And then I hopefully can stay
and not have to come back

00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:18.302 align:middle line:90%
and try again.

my life and go there.

Things would not work out right.

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:26.878 align:middle line:84%
But I think I'm a better
person about watching

00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:29.814 align:middle line:84%
for the needs of others and
not being always selfish.

00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:31.182 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm still selfish.

00:42:31.182 --> 00:42:32.984 align:middle line:90%
I'm still a human.

00:42:32.984 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But it has changed
my way of thinking.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.456 align:middle line:84%
>>How to love other
people and how

00:42:38.456 --> 00:42:43.027 align:middle line:84%
to-- how to forgive
and to put yourself

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:49.267 align:middle line:84%
in the place of other people
in order to understand them.

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:50.868 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that you have

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:56.641 align:middle line:84%
to do in order to love people
and in order to love yourself.

00:42:56.641 --> 00:43:03.581 align:middle line:84%
Because if you hold grudges
and you-- it hurts you.

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:05.683 align:middle line:90%
And it hurts the other people.

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:11.022 align:middle line:84%
And it's a barrier to
love if you can't forgive.

00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:14.892 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily have to
forget when people hurt you,

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:19.363 align:middle line:84%
but you have to understand
them and forgive them.

00:43:19.363 --> 00:43:23.768 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that is the
most important thing about love

00:43:23.768 --> 00:43:25.169 align:middle line:90%
that I've learned.

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:28.473 align:middle line:84%
And how to look
at how we're alike

00:43:28.473 --> 00:43:30.208 align:middle line:90%
rather than how we're different.

00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>This is the main message
which I brought back,

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:36.047 align:middle line:84%
that love is what
cannot be changed.

00:43:36.047 --> 00:43:38.249 align:middle line:90%
This is everlasting.

00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:41.953 align:middle line:84%
And love is with
life always together.

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:46.257 align:middle line:84%
Love-- what keeps
this world alive.

00:43:46.257 --> 00:43:49.126 align:middle line:90%
Love as an eternity.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:54.265 align:middle line:90%
Love as a basic of humankind.

00:43:54.265 --> 00:43:58.369 align:middle line:84%

because of love.

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:02.373 align:middle line:84%
And if we could all
bring that experience

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:04.709 align:middle line:84%
into our current
waking reality--

00:44:04.709 --> 00:44:07.378 align:middle line:84%
that's what happened
to me when I came back

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:09.013 align:middle line:90%
from that experience.

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:13.017 align:middle line:84%
And when I did come back
in, and after several months

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:17.154 align:middle line:84%
of severe memory
loss, I realized

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:19.657 align:middle line:84%
that the man that
was there to help me

00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:25.062 align:middle line:84%
was the man I had broken up with
before I had this experience

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.831 align:middle line:84%
and then now is the
man I'm married to.

00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:29.267 align:middle line:90%
So it is about love.

00:44:29.267 --> 00:44:32.236 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
all is about love.

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:38.809 align:middle line:84%
But how does that help someone
who has lost someone they love?

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:44.649 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, again, what
I think is that it's-- that

00:44:44.649 --> 00:44:48.286 align:middle line:84%
you're always going to
miss the person who died.

00:44:48.286 --> 00:44:51.455 align:middle line:84%
But to me it's very
comforting to know that,

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:56.294 align:middle line:84%
as based on literally
thousands upon thousands

00:44:56.294 --> 00:45:01.399 align:middle line:84%
upon thousands of cases, that
what people say is that you do

00:45:01.399 --> 00:45:03.167 align:middle line:90%
see them again.

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:05.069 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that
is very comforting.

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:08.005 align:middle line:84%
Even-- actually, Diane's
asking, what about pets?

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:08.806 align:middle line:90%
Do you see them?

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:10.007 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard anything?

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:13.711 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, you know,
Diane, not many cases

00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:17.982 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experiences
have I interviewed

00:45:17.982 --> 00:45:22.119 align:middle line:84%
where the people did
see a deceased pet.

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:24.589 align:middle line:90%
However, there have been some.

00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:30.528 align:middle line:84%
And-- now, this part is just
a conjecture and an intuition.

00:45:30.528 --> 00:45:36.133 align:middle line:84%
But I have a sense that
probably that part of it

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:37.635 align:middle line:90%
is under reported.

00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:42.206 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that, in
my grief counseling practice,

00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:45.943 align:middle line:84%
I see people who are
there because they're

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:48.379 align:middle line:90%
grieving the loss of a pet.

00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:53.351 align:middle line:84%
And so I know how powerful
an experience that is.

00:45:53.351 --> 00:45:56.554 align:middle line:84%
And also, people
in that situation

00:45:56.554 --> 00:45:59.357 align:middle line:84%
generally tell me that they
feel embarrassed because they're

00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:02.226 align:middle line:84%
afraid to talk about
their family with this.

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.995 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
their family will

00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:07.398 align:middle line:84%
be understanding, that it's
a sign of weakness, blah,

00:46:07.398 --> 00:46:08.599 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, all those things.

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.901 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, I've heard
that the loss of a pet is--

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.169 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes, it absolutely is.

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:14.338 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --almost as bad
as the loss of a loved one.

00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Or it will reignite the
pain of a lost loved one.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:17.241 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: It does.

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:20.478 align:middle line:84%
And so what I would say in
answer to Diane's question

00:46:20.478 --> 00:46:23.914 align:middle line:84%
is that I don't know
many cases of that,

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:84%
but I think there are
probably many more.

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:28.753 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
probably that that

00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:31.555 align:middle line:84%
is something that would be
too personal for many people

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:32.790 align:middle line:90%
to relate.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.958 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, I'm sure.

00:46:33.958 --> 00:46:37.261 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely because
the animals themselves

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:38.696 align:middle line:90%
are so unconditionally loving.

00:46:38.696 --> 00:46:41.165 align:middle line:84%
It does fit right
into that concept

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:44.835 align:middle line:84%
of the overarching theme
here, which is love.

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:48.639 align:middle line:84%
Love is experienced on the other
side that you've heard about.

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:51.709 align:middle line:84%
It teaches us back
into this reality

00:46:51.709 --> 00:46:54.145 align:middle line:84%
that love is the
most important thing.

00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:57.448 align:middle line:84%
As you said to me when I
very first spoke to you,

00:46:57.448 --> 00:46:59.150 align:middle line:84%
love is the most
important thing.

Another one of our
Facebook questions

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:04.722 align:middle line:90%
coming in from Robbie.

00:47:04.722 --> 00:47:06.957 align:middle line:84%
After near-death
experience, are people

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:08.492 align:middle line:90%
more psychic or intuitive?

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:11.262 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard that from
the cases that you've studied?

00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:12.963 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well,
thank you, Robbie.

>>LISA: Yeah.

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:13.631 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

>>MOODY: And you know,
this is something

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:17.001 align:middle line:84%
I began to see from
the very beginning.

00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:20.337 align:middle line:84%
I remember a wonderful
woman who was

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:23.908 align:middle line:84%
the receptionist of a medical
doctor in Macon, Georgia.

00:47:23.908 --> 00:47:25.409 align:middle line:90%
My dad was a doctor there.

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:29.513 align:middle line:84%
And one of his fellow
physicians, his receptionist

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:31.382 align:middle line:90%
had had this experience.

00:47:31.382 --> 00:47:34.618 align:middle line:84%
And she talked with me
about this, Mrs. Stokes.

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:39.523 align:middle line:84%
And what she told me was that,
yes, that after her experience,

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:41.258 align:middle line:84%
she found, for
example, that when

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:44.462 align:middle line:84%
she would go into the
elevator with people,

00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:46.697 align:middle line:84%
that she would have
this way of picking up

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:50.234 align:middle line:84%
on what people were thinking
or what their troubles were,

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:51.168 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:54.071 align:middle line:84%
And exactly how to
account for that,

00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:58.109 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, except to say
that this experience really

00:47:58.109 --> 00:48:01.378 align:middle line:84%
does break down
people's ego boundaries.

00:48:01.378 --> 00:48:04.048 align:middle line:84%
It's like they become
different people.

00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:05.816 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
it makes them more

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:08.152 align:middle line:84%
attuned to the
feeling of others.

00:48:08.152 --> 00:48:10.387 align:middle line:84%

They're not a factor anymore.

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:29.273 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I really
want to mention,

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:31.609 align:middle line:84%
and I want to make sure that
I'm clear about the fact

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:34.912 align:middle line:84%
that I don't want to speak about
death being a trivial thing.

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:38.349 align:middle line:84%
Death is a very
honorable transition.

00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.916 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:41.752 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And people have
many different senses of it.

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:45.389 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one
fear of Americans.

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:49.126 align:middle line:84%
It is also a lot
about the unknown.

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:51.428 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to make
sure people understand

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:54.398 align:middle line:84%
the conversation we're having
completely, fully honors

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:55.299 align:middle line:90%
the experience.

00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:02.706 align:middle line:84%
I definitely want to mention
that this is to be honored.

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:04.141 align:middle line:90%
This is about education.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.610 align:middle line:84%

00:49:07.645 --> 00:49:10.514 align:middle line:84%

the movie "Life After Life,"

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:31.769 align:middle line:84%
which is a Gaiam
movie, by the way, that

00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:35.472 align:middle line:84%
explains how the fear
of death goes away

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.175 align:middle line:84%
after this experience from these
people that are interviewed.

that their fear of death

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.849 align:middle line:84%
is totally gone
after this, that they

00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:48.519 align:middle line:84%
have no more fear
of death whatsoever.

life, infinite light,

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:58.429 align:middle line:90%
as an everlasting being.

We cannot die because we are
already created for to live

00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:05.502 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:10.841 align:middle line:84%
The dimension of spirit

that I have learned

is that life is forever.

00:50:15.246 --> 00:50:17.348 align:middle line:84%
Death is nothing more
or less than a doorway,

00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:18.983 align:middle line:90%
something you walk through.

00:50:18.983 --> 00:50:20.951 align:middle line:90%

Don't be afraid.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:27.725 align:middle line:84%
Death is only the part as a
station, railroad station,

00:50:27.725 --> 00:50:31.862 align:middle line:84%
where you come always
to go to another life.

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.831 align:middle line:84%
>>I find it very
comforting and encouraging

00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:36.533 align:middle line:84%
to hear from so many people
who have explored life

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:40.938 align:middle line:84%
beyond physical death
that life goes on.

00:50:40.938 --> 00:50:43.941 align:middle line:84%

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:03.694 align:middle line:84%
been through this experience,
which I was very lost before.

00:51:03.694 --> 00:51:05.195 align:middle line:84%
I didn't pay attention
to it at all.

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:08.732 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to deny that that ever
happened to me until I became

familiar with your definitions.

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:15.639 align:middle line:84%

a sense of belonging, I guess.

a part in the reemergence of the
study of near-death experiences

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:38.162 align:middle line:84%
and to Western traditions,
because actually,

00:51:38.162 --> 00:51:40.397 align:middle line:84%
that's how the Western
traditions began.

Plato and the early
Greek philosophers

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:45.936 align:middle line:84%
were fascinated by
this, as we are today.

So that, too.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:51.075 align:middle line:84%
But I think that also, in
terms of professional things,

00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:54.645 align:middle line:84%
that what I'm going to be more
remembered for is probably

00:51:54.645 --> 00:52:00.017 align:middle line:84%
my work in conceptualizing
new ways of thinking,

00:52:00.017 --> 00:52:01.986 align:middle line:84%
what you might
broadly call logic.

00:52:01.986 --> 00:52:04.121 align:middle line:84%
Because I was a
professor of logic.
