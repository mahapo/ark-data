00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a gift of healing?

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And would you like to
learn how to activate

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that gift of healing
deep inside yourself?

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me today is master
energy healer Deborah King.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And she's here to talk about
how to awaken our own healing

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:84%
energy so we can start to heal
ourselves, and then, in turn,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:90%
heal others.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Deborah, herself, is a New
York Times best selling author.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.432 align:middle line:84%
She's the creator of
LifeForce Energy Healing.

00:00:40.432 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a course that we're
going to be getting a chance

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to experience later
on in the show.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go on a
journey into our 8th chakra.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, thanks for being here.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBORAH KING: Great,
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am excited.

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn about the 8th
chakra and how to-- I think

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.840 align:middle line:90%
that this is--

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.631 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: And beyond.

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, and beyond, right?

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:90%
So how did you get started?

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
What started you on
your whole journey here,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.132 align:middle line:90%
what was the spark?

00:01:03.132 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, Lisa.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
My goodness, it was so long
ago and it was so unexpected.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:90%
So I was just out of law school.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Young lawyer, on the fast track
to, I hoped, corporate success.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Just six months out, and
woke up with cancer one day.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Really unexpected.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Woke up one
day with cancer.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yes.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No sign?

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.742 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Nope, no signs.

00:01:25.742 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What kind
of cancer was it?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: You know, it was
of the female organs.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was really puzzled
about the whole thing.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to the
doctors and I said,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:90%
would you give me some time?

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to do surgery and
I asked them for six months.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's slow
growing, we can do that.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I was just a young
woman, I wasn't

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.140 align:middle line:84%
anxious to lose my
ability to have children.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So I got off my life for just
a minute and looked at myself.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'd never done that before.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know that's
fashionable these days,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.515 align:middle line:84%
but back then it wasn't, and
nobody else was doing it.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wait, you said
something interesting.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
"I got off my life
and looked at it."

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, I was just
busy moving forward as fast

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:90%
as I could.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
I had never stopped and thought,
who am I and what am I doing?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So I literally stepped off
of it like it was a treadmill

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and I looked at it
and I was like, oh no.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew,
secretly in my heart,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I knew I had addiction issues.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to face them.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.106 align:middle line:90%
And it was popular at the time.

00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I was using the drugs of
choice, I was drinking too much,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:90%
I was taking too much Valium.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to
12 Step programs.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing I did.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And I got a lot
of clarity there.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The second thing I did
within a matter of weeks

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.281 align:middle line:90%
was I learned to meditate.

00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I have no idea where
I was inspired to do that.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: None of the
12 Step programs?

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
It was just something that you--

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.905 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: No, just
out of the blue.

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And I learned to meditate and
got a whole bunch more clarity

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:90%
really fast.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I
went back to my doctors.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I was maybe a month into
this thing, and I said,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.676 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look around
at alternative medicine.

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what's that?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
No one knew, you
know, it was so new.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So I started dipping
my toe very carefully.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I was very skeptical, being
a lawyer and everything.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I was very scientific,
and very left brain.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And I tried a little
this, a little that.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I went to a massage
therapist and she

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
suggested I see
an energy healer.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I thought, what's that?

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It sounds weird.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm up for it.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.405 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: When was this?

00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Sounds weird.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: It was more
than 25 years ago.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So I went to see this energy
healer, and she must have been,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.481 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, very psychic, because
she dressed appropriately

00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:90%
for the day.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.437 align:middle line:90%
She came in in a suit.

00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, we look the same.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And I was like [SIGH OF RELIEF].

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.939 align:middle line:90%
You know how reassuring that is.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So I saw her three times, and
I had an amazing remission

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.395 align:middle line:90%
right on her table.

00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yep.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I knew it, she knew it.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Then what did you do?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: We talked about it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I left her office and
promptly the next day

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
went back to the
teaching hospital

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
where I was being seen, because
I wanted verifiable proof.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Being a good red-blooded
American, I wanted an x-ray.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said, hey,
you've had what

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:90%
we call a spontaneous remission.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding me.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.943 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Uh-uh.

00:04:17.943 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that
moment that you probably

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.719 align:middle line:90%
just said, sign me up.

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.843 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I did.

00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that this
gal that I had seen,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I had heard somewhere
that she had

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:90%
some kind of a teaching program.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm going
to go learn this stuff.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.037 align:middle line:90%
I'm just curious.

00:04:34.037 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying for years, I just
kept saying, I'm just curious,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.703 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting involved,
I'm busy being a lawyer.

00:04:38.703 --> 00:04:42.417 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you didn't make any
mental choices, or switches?

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you said that you
stopped many of the addictions

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:90%
and you started to look within.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: That's all I had done.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.529 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You just looked.

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.274 align:middle line:84%
You didn't make any testaments
to your life, to change?

00:04:52.274 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
You didn't change your
relationships, your location,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:90%
you just--

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I didn't change
my mindset either.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You didn't?

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Except I opened
myself to other possibilities.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you the funny
thing that happened next.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.565 align:middle line:84%
So I'm walking out of this
teaching hospital in San

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:07.814 align:middle line:84%
Francisco and I'm thinking,
I'm going to call that gal

00:05:07.814 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:90%
and go study her stuff.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I went down the steps to
the curb to catch a cab,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I tripped over a
kiosk on the curb,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and as I was
catching my balance,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I saw inside something written
that said the word, healing.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Caught my eye.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
It seemed somewhat
serendipitous,

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
so I took it back to the
hotel with me and I read it,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, oh no,
it sounded religious.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, [GROAN].

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I had a limiting belief.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Like so many
20-somethings, I had

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
thrown the baby, the
bathwater, the whole thing out.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And wasn't going to do religion.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So I had to discard my limiting
belief to call these people.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:90%
I was so curious about them.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Something about
healing through prayer.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And I called them,
and I met with them,

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:90%
and I ended up staying 10 years.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It was quite a moment.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.944 align:middle line:90%
Quite a big deal.

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you never went
back to being an attorney?

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Nope.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, I continue to
practice law to pay the bills.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.453 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, you did?

00:06:05.453 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Oh yeah, I had a day
job until I was pushing 50.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:90%
I kept my day job.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.777 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, you have to.

00:06:12.777 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I know.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.115 align:middle line:84%
But many people
just, they do, they

00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
throw the baby out
with the bathwater.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I didn't
throw that baby out.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I kept that one.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But this group, that I
call esoteric Christians

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:84%
because they're
not around anymore.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
They could have just as
well been esoteric Jewish,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:90%
or esoteric Islamic.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It was very ancient
teachings that actually,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
all the traditions share,
I later discovered.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And I did, I stayed
with them 10 years

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and I learned some
amazing techniques.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that where you had
your original introduction

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.705 align:middle line:90%
to energy medicine?

00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: But they wouldn't
have ever called it that.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.935 align:middle line:90%
They called it something else.

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.859 align:middle line:90%
Finally-- sadly, I left them.

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:01.025 align:middle line:84%
It was a very sad parting
because they were amazing.

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:90%
They were wonderful.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:90%
They were also dying out.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.655 align:middle line:84%
They were people in their
90s, they were very elderly.

00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that why you left?

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I left
because I still wanted

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:84%
to learn that hands-on
thing I had seen

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
the woman do that I
had the remission with.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to go
back and learn that.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it was different.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
different, just different.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So I-- sadly, I
left these people,

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
but took all their
teachings with me.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For 10 years, yeah.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: And I enrolled
in that gal's school,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:90%
from way back when.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.589 align:middle line:90%
So I show up, day one.

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:34.755 align:middle line:84%
I'm still wearing my little
round collar, my pearls.

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, still a lawyer,
I've got my little yellow pad.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.125 align:middle line:84%
And I sit way in the back of the
room, I'm going to take notes,

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:90%
What did I know?

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
about an hour in,

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
she points at me in
the back of the room.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.965 align:middle line:90%
And she says, you back there.

00:07:47.965 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't recognize
me, 10 years, you know.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:90%
She says, stand up.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And I stood up.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And she goes,
where did you learn

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.476 align:middle line:84%
to do that distance
healing stuff you're doing?

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Because she was working
with people up front.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.285 align:middle line:84%
I went oh, oh, where I'm
from they call that prayer.

00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:90%
So it was all the same.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:06.952 align:middle line:90%
It was all the same.

00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she sensed what you
were doing in the techniques

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:90%
that you had learned.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: So she just had
a different name for it,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
she called it distance healing,
and they called it prayer.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, and we have
different names for God.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.728 align:middle line:84%
There's different names for
so many different things,

00:08:19.728 --> 00:08:22.619 align:middle line:90%
but it's all the same frequency.

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, in different intensities.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:24.493 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It is.

00:08:24.493 --> 00:08:25.867 align:middle line:90%
It's a vibration, absolutely.

00:08:25.867 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Different
intensities, though.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And people's belief
systems contribute

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:90%
to those intensities.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
So you saw her, and you started
a journey on hands-on healing.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I did.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:84%
And that was a lengthy program,
it was four years long.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up
staying and teaching,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
actually, in that school for
another half a dozen years

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I also followed
ministers, and priests,

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:90%
and rabbis around for a while.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And did my thesis on what
kind of energy, if any,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
they were working with
when they did healings.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.695 align:middle line:84%
In all of these religions
they do some sort of-- you

00:09:02.695 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:84%
know, very quiet usually
over in the side chapel--

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.010 align:middle line:84%
they do some kind
of healing work.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.885 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these are
things that you studied,

00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that you researched,
that you spent time with?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You weren't born
with the gift, and it

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.145 align:middle line:84%
didn't come from the
knock on the head?

00:09:15.145 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Not that
I know of, nope.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.353 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:09:17.353 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I love the practicality
because it shows people

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.929 align:middle line:84%
that every single
person can do this.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Absolutely.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, it might not
take 15 years, it might.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what your
journey is, what your path is.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Someone else might
take five minutes, really.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So every single one of us is
actually a natural born healer.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
We have all of this
information deeply

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:84%
embedded in our cellular
memory and we've just

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:90%
misplaced it slightly.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Culturally, we're under a
lot of pressure these days.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And so we forget we
have these talents.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But you ask just about
anybody on the street, hey,

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:84%
do you know when you're child's
gonna call-- the school's going

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
to call because your kid's sick
before they-- Oh, I sense it.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Or can you tell
who is calling you

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
before you look
at your caller ID?

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Often you can.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think this
is going to become,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:90%
it's going to bypass cellphones.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.887 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is the
future of communication.

00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole different channel.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Telepathy, absolutely.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So then, tell us how you, then,
started you on your journey

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
with John of God and how you
discovered a different healing

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
direction?

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.107 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's the same really.

00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It is.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And so after I had
spent years teaching

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
what I would call
chakra-based healing, that's

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.532 align:middle line:84%
the energy school kind of
thing, it's all Hindu teachings.

00:10:36.532 --> 00:10:37.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was interesting.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.031 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you
something Lisa, I found

00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that the esoteric Christians
had really strong connection

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.632 align:middle line:84%
to source, but their
techniques were pretty bad,

00:10:46.632 --> 00:10:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and they got banged up a lot.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I followed
those ministers,

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.867 align:middle line:84%
and rabbis, and
whatnot around, I

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
could tell which ones
were really connected.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But they had no ability
to protect themselves,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:90%
they hadn't been taught that.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what you mean.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yes.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And over in the formal
Hindu chakra-based trainings

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that I received, they had
great technique handed down

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:84%
over the years through the
'40s, '50s, '60s in the US.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very strong here.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they had
lost their connection.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.155 align:middle line:90%
So I married the two together.

00:11:17.155 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the
technique, though,

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.660 align:middle line:84%
would be skills, tools of
protection, hands-on healing

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.375 align:middle line:84%
But then it got clouded,
that pure, just connection

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:90%
to the source.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Then I went to Asia
and I spent a lot of time

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.445 align:middle line:90%
there, mainly with the Nepalese.

00:11:33.445 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:90%
A lot of time studying there.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've also spent,
as you mentioned,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:84%
time in South America with a
lot of shamanic traditions,

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:90%
including John of God's.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you find a
theme amongst everything

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:84%
that works specifically for you,
or did you take a little bit

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:90%
from each?

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I took a
little from each.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.502 align:middle line:84%
They all have an underlying
consistent theme.

00:11:54.502 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is?

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Of vibration,
as you just mentioned.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:90%
It's all vibratory.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:84%
They have different
words for it.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
In Mexico they call
it the luminous body.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.682 align:middle line:84%
And in India they call it the
chakras, and the energy field.

00:12:07.682 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's all the same,
it's all the same.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.348 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even in science
they call it frequency.

00:12:11.348 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, or the
unified field, in science.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's where
it all comes together,

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:84%
is through frequency
and vibration.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Through all of the
different texts

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.810 align:middle line:84%
that you studied
over the two decades,

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
you learned about
frequency and vibration.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:90%
So is that what you teach now?

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: In a way.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
That might be the
foundational item.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.379 align:middle line:84%
I often use music
analogies, I mean,

00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:84%
there's so many different
ways to teach it,

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.690 align:middle line:90%
but it's experiential.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can teach the basics in
a more cerebral, left-brain kind

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But then to really teach
the higher techniques,

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
it has to be pretty
much in-person.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.015 align:middle line:90%
Because it's an experience.

00:12:58.015 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
People have to feel
it in their bodies.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Although I'm finding that
people write all the time,

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
they email all the time from a
live stream, and they're like,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.619 align:middle line:90%
I felt it.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, right.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Something that you have recorded
that holds the frequency

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and that people can watch later
and get the same frequency.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We're going to watch one
of those in a little bit.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So tell me how you discovered
your specific slant

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:90%
on the chakras.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And is it yours,
or is it something

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:90%
that you brought in to teach us?

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.942 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a really
clear way of describing it.

00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, I've learned it
from so many different places

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.662 align:middle line:84%
and then some things were just
added on for me in meditations

00:13:36.662 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not sure
I can even answer

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
your question about
precisely what it is,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.412 align:middle line:90%
or where it came from.

00:13:42.412 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is it
primarily-- do you

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:84%
start to teach through
the chakras first?

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.499 align:middle line:84%
Is that your first way to
really introduce people

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
to their own healing energy
and their own energy field?

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It is.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
would do is teach you

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.890 align:middle line:90%
how to use a pendulum.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've designed
my own, these days,

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so worried people
will use metal or stone which

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:84%
makes it a lot harder to
read a chakra's movement.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even crystals?

00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh, crystal can cut one.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So I really recommend to people
that they start with beechwood.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And use this shape,
because this is

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
the best shape for
reading a chakra.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you mentioned not
to do it on myself, right?

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So can you teach us
how to use this on me?

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I can.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So you would hold it about
three inches in front

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
of your partner,
or your friend's,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
or your cousin's, seven main
chakras, going from the base

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the head.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And what you, the
observer, is looking for

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:90%
is clockwise movement.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Clockwise movement from the
observer's point of view,

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.583 align:middle line:90%
not the subject's point of view.

00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
hard to do yourself.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Also when you try to
do it on yourself,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a
fairly developed sense

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
of your own energy field so
that you're not overpowering it.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Because, Lisa, this thing
is just an amplifier.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not magic.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It amplifies movement.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So if I hold it in front of
an air conditioning duct,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
it will reflect
the air movement.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you hold it
in front of a chakra,

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:84%
it will-- a chakra's a very
subtle, energetic center

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
of energy in your
personal energy field.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.270 align:middle line:90%
It will reflect motion.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
looking for, again,

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
is you're looking for
preferably clockwise, preferably

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:90%
some kind of motion.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to dead
in the water, that's

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:90%
the scientific term for it.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, no movement at all?

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.224 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: None.

00:15:29.224 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that would mean
that that particular chakra is

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:90%
blocked, right?

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Blocked, or so
often with students,

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.305 align:middle line:84%
I find they're in
the wrong place.

00:15:37.305 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Especially with the
first three chakras

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.442 align:middle line:90%
which are a little hard to find.

00:15:40.442 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Because lots of times they'll
be an inch off, or two.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
it's not moving.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.376 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
you're nowhere

00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
near it, that's why
it's not moving.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Then from here up,
they're pretty simple.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
It's heart, throat,
third eye, crown.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Kind of hard to lose.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But one, two, and three,
especially with women

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.508 align:middle line:84%
in skirts, it's pretty hard
to tell exactly where it is.

00:16:00.508 --> 00:16:02.334 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they're
just energy centers

00:16:02.334 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
that are located in
various parts of the body.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Along the spine.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Along the spine.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, from the base
of the spine to the top.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And then they hold
frequencies that

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:17.692 align:middle line:84%
represent certain emotional
aspects of your life, right?

00:16:17.692 --> 00:16:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Wow, yes.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
That's actually fairly
advanced knowledge.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.316 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I read your material.

00:16:25.316 --> 00:16:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah,
because most people

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:90%
think it's the other way around.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.236 align:middle line:84%
They think the chakra's causing
the emotion, and it's not.

00:16:30.236 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
The emotion is making the
chakra move, or not move.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So here, let me
just demonstrate.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll just pick
your heart chakra.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.655 align:middle line:84%
And I see, I'm about
three inches out,

00:16:40.655 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:90%
and I'm right in front of it.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting great
clockwise movement.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite large, by
the way, good for you.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's just exactly
what we're looking for.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
All the way up from
the base at the sacrum,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:90%
right to the top of the head.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever start it
or instigate it with your hand?

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: No.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It just
starts to move itself.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.562 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Oh yeah.

00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Now if your hand
shakes, or there's

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:84%
air conditioning in the room or
something, be attuned to that.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But focus on
holding it as still as you

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:90%
can so that it can move.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, so you can
really hold it pretty still.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.415 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now let's
talk about when

00:17:12.415 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
you find one that is
not moving or moving

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:90%
in the opposite direction.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Or elliptical,
meaning not round,

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:90%
but kind of cockeyed.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So how do you start
to clear-- now

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:84%
the pendulum itself doesn't
clear that type of energy,

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.384 align:middle line:90%
You need to start looking at it.

00:17:27.384 --> 00:17:27.966 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:17:27.966 --> 00:17:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of like
training wheels on a bike.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.127 align:middle line:84%
It kind of tells you
what you're seeing there,

00:17:32.127 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:90%
what you're sensing.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.168 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a barometer, OK.

00:17:34.168 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: So I encourage
students in my programs

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.882 align:middle line:84%
to first of all look at
someone's heart chakra and go,

00:17:39.882 --> 00:17:40.717 align:middle line:90%
it looks good to me.

00:17:40.717 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Then test it with the pendulum
and see if you and the pendulum

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.730 align:middle line:90%
agree.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.325 align:middle line:84%
And then note it, go over
and note it on your form,

00:17:48.325 --> 00:17:49.610 align:middle line:90%
on an intake form.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And then pretty soon after
you've done this for a while,

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:90%
you don't need this anymore.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.901 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You get it.

00:17:53.901 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: This is just to
support you in your learning.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great, great.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that
you can sweep the body

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.279 align:middle line:84%
and just look at
instinctively eventually.

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah, ultimately.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, you just glance
at somebody and you'll nail it.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
This stuff is so
easy to learn, again,

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's built
into your unconscious.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, Jung
always talked about

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:90%
the collective unconscious.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.581 align:middle line:90%
It's very much part of us.

00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So what is it, and
just how to clear it?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the part that
we are get stuck on.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Let me just back up and
answer one of your questions

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
about how it got unclear.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So I started to say the
emotions make the chakras move.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But when we hold an emotion
and we don't process it,

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
that's what blocks it
and makes it stop moving.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So your partner and
you have a fight.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And you feel really
hurt about it.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.664 align:middle line:84%
And it hurts so much you
close your heart chakra.

00:18:47.664 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:84%
We learn to do this
as little tiny kids.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mhm, death of a
loved one, or an animal.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Your pappy.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that starts
when you're little.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.187 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: And so all
our lives-- I'd

00:18:57.187 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:84%
like to talk about the
heart because we know

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.464 align:middle line:84%
it's the easiest one to
tune into to feel yourself.

00:19:01.464 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You know whether your
own heart's open or not.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of know
when our heart's closed.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So what stops our
chakras dead in the water

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:84%
is taking an emotion and saying,
I'm not going to feel that.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I am going to pretend
that never happened.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:90%
That horrible, kick in the gut--

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.776 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Otherwise
known as trauma.

00:19:18.776 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.407 align:middle line:84%
Trauma is unresolved
emotion, right?

00:19:22.407 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It is.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you stick it,
you compartmentalize it.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.794 align:middle line:84%
You think it's gonna
just away, and you're not

00:19:27.794 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:90%
going to deal with it again.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.486 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: And instead, what
we're designed to do--

00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and little kids,
you'll see them.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.818 align:middle line:84%
They'll have a tantrum,
and they let it all go.

00:19:34.818 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a sunny smile
and they're back to themselves.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, I mean yes,
little, little kids.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But as you get into
the teenage years,

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
emotional intelligence yet

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.687 align:middle line:90%
to process big trauma.

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.228 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And so it does.

00:19:49.228 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:90%
We all have that.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Between 11 and 15 we don't
have the emotional intelligence

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to process death, and divorce,
and sex, things like that.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Or an earthquake.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Think how upset people were
over earthquakes, or fires,

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:90%
or floods.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, national disasters.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:84%
That can really
whack us out too.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so just by
the fact that we wouldn't

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.125 align:middle line:84%
have had that emotional
intelligence at that age,

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:15.947 align:middle line:90%
we stick it away.

00:20:15.947 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:90%
We store it.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Put it
into a little box.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:18.503 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: We store it.

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:90%
And then it festers.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And then when your chakra
is not moving, or when

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:84%
it's moving the
wrong way-- now this

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:90%
is a really interesting point.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:84%
When a chakra is going
reverse, what it's doing

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:84%
is it's sending out to the
world a message from you

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.030 align:middle line:84%
to the world that is
your limiting belief that

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is making your
chakra do that thing.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
your partner leaves.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.827 align:middle line:90%
And you're just heartbroken.

00:20:43.827 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And you decide, well,
I'm not lovable.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:90%
That's why he or she left.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So you send a message out from
this chakra going the wrong way

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that I can't be loved,
or I'm not lovable.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you'll get, of course.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And that just
establishes the truth

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
of how we're always saying
we create our own reality.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.245 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:21:00.245 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you find that
when you had the cancer,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
did you look back and
find the limiting beliefs

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.527 align:middle line:84%
that you put around
your female organs?

00:21:09.527 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I did.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I found all
the trauma I'd had

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:84%
that I never wanted
to think about.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.908 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I
didn't remember I'd

00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
had a pretty stressful childhood
with a fair amount of abuse,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:90%
but I had just stored it.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.216 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going to talk about.

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
People still don't
talk about it today,

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:90%
but I certainly wasn't going to.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and it can cause trouble.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 20s,
somebody else might

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
be in their 40s or their
60s when it finally erupts.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When it
erupts and manifests

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.560 align:middle line:84%
in something like
cancer or injury.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.080 align:middle line:84%
What about accidents
and trauma where

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
you're getting various
types of things like that?

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Can it register
into, say the back?

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have back
pain and trauma in the back.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, it can register
anywhere in the body.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And stay?

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.561 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Yeah.

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is you want
your energy field-- so

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:84%
think of yourself as sitting
inside this bubble of energy

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.791 align:middle line:84%
and these chakras are
like the focal points.

00:22:01.791 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like a
beautiful bubble,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
you hope, of beautiful,
clear colors.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:84%
When you stop part
of it, I will not

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
feel that car accident
I had last week.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.812 align:middle line:84%
That was so upsetting, I'm
not going to think about.

00:22:12.812 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just move
on, just move on.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: That energy
freezes, just

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:90%
like your blood or your lymph.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.820 align:middle line:90%
You want it moving all the time.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when it stops
moving, it makes your field,

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:84%
your energy field,
all muddy looking.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.445 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, since our bodies
grow out of our energy field--

00:22:29.445 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:90%
this is such a key point.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
The body actually
grows out of the field.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Your body is ultimately going
to look like your field.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So if your field's all
muddy, pretty soon the body

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
starts to have--
it starts subtle,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.794 align:middle line:90%
with headaches and depression.

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
You go to the
doctor, and he goes,

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I can't find anything wrong.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But your energy field,
you're already sensing it.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am, because
I'm excited to learn

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:90%
how to clear it.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I did have, I had an
accident where after I moved

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I pulled a chest of
drawers down on my body.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:90%
It was off balance.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So my back has been
on fire since then.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that you can teach

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:84%
us to start to break
that energy up?

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I know that
chiropractics is helping,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and the muscle stem is
helping, and all of that.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Heat, ice, heat, ice.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But I want to get to
the cellular trauma,

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.765 align:middle line:84%
because it was
very traumatizing.

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, the first thing I
would suggest-- not necessarily

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%
for that accident with
the chest of drawers--

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:84%
but one of the first things
I would suggest for any time

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling like
things didn't go well

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that day would be
a clearing bath.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So a clearing bath is
a pound of sea salt,

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:90%
and a pound of baking soda.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Baking soda.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I got into a bath with
Epsom salts that night.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Same thing, or no?

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Similar, very similar.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Stronger, stronger.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:90%
But this you can do every day.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Sea salt, baking soda.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.222 align:middle line:90%
It mimics the ocean.

00:23:53.222 --> 00:23:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.179 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: If it's handy, you
could go jump in the ocean.

00:23:56.179 --> 00:23:57.685 align:middle line:90%
It's never handy.

00:23:57.685 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:90%
The Pacific's a little cold.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
This would be not too hot,
20 minutes, kind of tepid.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And you should feel
better the next day.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.485 align:middle line:84%
This especially
works well if you've

00:24:07.485 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:84%
been slimed by other
people in a low level way.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Not a super
hurtful, big drama thing.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.709 align:middle line:90%
But just kind of--

00:24:14.709 --> 00:24:16.125 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Conferences
do that, where

00:24:16.125 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:90%
you gather a lot to energy.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.594 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: A lot of
negative energy,

00:24:18.594 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:90%
just kind of what I call slime.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
For a stronger
kind of clearing, I

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
would recommend, as
you just mentioned,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Epsom salts and alcohol.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a trick to
this, you have to burn it.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So you take a pot, and
you fill it about halfway.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It has to be
ceramic, for safety,

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to get very hot.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
You fill it about
halfway with Epsom salts.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you pour
about a tablespoon

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
of the highest-proof
alcohol you can get.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a what?

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.424 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Highest-proof alcohol
you can get your hands on.

00:24:57.424 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:84%
It has to be pretty high
proof, because you're

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:90%
going to light it.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:04.372 align:middle line:84%
So then you light it,
and you use a oven mitt.

00:25:04.372 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And don't do what I did, I
almost burned the curtains

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
down one time, because
you can clear a room.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So you walk around like
this with the oven mitt.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:90%
And there's a--

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.879 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you use
like a saucepan?

00:25:15.879 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:90%
But it would be--

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.253 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Metal.

00:25:17.253 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It has to be ceramic.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.789 align:middle line:90%
If you have a ceramic saucepan.

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It has to be
ceramic all the way through.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Mhm.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.063 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't get
anything larger than this

00:25:24.063 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:84%
or you'll get too
big of a flame.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in certain
light, you'll see the flame

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and there's a smoke.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.725 align:middle line:84%
And it clears-- this
is an old chef's trick.

00:25:32.725 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:84%
This is how a commercial
chef would clear his kitchen.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The fish smell
out of the kitchen.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: The whole thing.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Just don't burn the place down.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's
highly flammable,

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:90%
but does it create a smoke?

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It does.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And not a smoke,
it creates a gas.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's clear.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.528 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you can't see it?

00:25:48.528 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, in a
certain light perhaps.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:90%
But you can smell it.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It has kind of a chemical smell,
and it will clear the heck out

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:90%
of a room, or a person.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You just have to,
again, be very careful

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:84%
as you go up and
down their body.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.445 align:middle line:84%
And go up and down their
front and their back.

00:26:01.445 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is it
the neutralizing

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:90%
odor that comes from or the gas?

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: It's the
gas, it's the gas.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, it works very
similar to, for example, sage.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Sage is not as strong.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And sage, the problem with
sage, when you burn sage

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get a
lot of odor in the room.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And the hotel
personelle are going

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:90%
to come knock on the door.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.515 align:middle line:84%
And the smoke alarm's
going to go off.

00:26:25.515 --> 00:26:27.824 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.824 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these
are ways that you

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.680 align:middle line:84%
can start to clear
your energy field

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and start to
rebalance the chakras.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.354 align:middle line:90%
What about crystals?

00:26:34.354 --> 00:26:35.853 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Crystal is
another good way.

00:26:35.853 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
be really careful

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.190 align:middle line:84%
that your crystal
matches your energy

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.090 align:middle line:90%
and isn't a stronger vibration.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How would you know?

00:26:42.395 --> 00:26:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well if
you get a crystal

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and you don't feel well, a day
or two later do what I did.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I took mine out to the
far reaches of my ranch

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:90%
and threw it over a fence.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.456 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden I felt better.

00:26:53.456 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You got it out.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I got it out
of my environment.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, crystals are tricky.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if I resonate
towards, maybe the amethyst.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Would I know instinctively what
I've always resonated towards?

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Probably.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, because I seem to
have a lot of amethyst around.

00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:09.208 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I bet.

00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that
makes more sense.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.064 align:middle line:84%
All right, so these are ways
to actually clear it and start

00:27:15.064 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to get the-- and then you test
it again with the pendulum,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: I would wait
about three days.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.757 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, how many times and
how often should you do this?

00:27:23.757 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, you should really
take a clearing bath-- that's

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:90%
the sea salt and baking soda.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day?

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: No, but
maybe every day where

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
you feel that
you've been invaded,

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:84%
or experiences at work
or at home were toxic.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, anything like that,
I'd recommend a clearing bath.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.281 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
completing things?

00:27:41.281 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Like when you
complete a schooling

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.490 align:middle line:84%
or a project, or something,
can you clear the energy?

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Or if you want to sell a
house, or something like that.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: You can.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to do it is
just create your own ritual.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Whatever works for you.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Have a little altar at
home with your own things

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:90%
that you know work for you.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:84%
It could be an
animal totem that you

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.239 align:middle line:84%
like and an image from a
tradition that you admire.

00:28:06.239 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be the
one you were raised in,

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.180 align:middle line:90%
whatever works for you.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And you just sense into
it, and you'll know.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's great to have a
ritual to end something.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:84%
We've forgotten this, that
historically, of course,

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.730 align:middle line:84%
we always had rituals
for the end of puberty,

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.384 align:middle line:90%
and the marriage, and death.

00:28:24.384 --> 00:28:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
getting very casual.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, yes.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Many traditions have lost that.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about that in a second,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:84%
but first I want you to
take a look at this video

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.681 align:middle line:84%
where Deborah takes us
through the chakras.

00:28:33.681 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is a bit
of an exercise.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.821 align:middle line:84%
So go through this with
Deborah and you'll be able to--

00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's beautiful colors
that come throughout the video.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be able to
resonate with those colors

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and balance your chakras as
you go along with this video.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.114 align:middle line:90%
So take a look.

00:28:47.114 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>Hi, I'm Deborah King.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm a master energy healer
and spiritual teacher.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And today I'm going to talk
to you about the energy

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:90%
system of the chakras.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to help
you open and activate

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:84%
the little known,
but super important

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:03.240 align:middle line:90%
8th chakra above your head.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So you'll want to
watch this video

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.830 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
so you get activated.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%
The chakras hold
the secrets to how

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
you feel about yourself
and your world.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:84%
How you get along
with other people.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:90%
The health of your body.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Your financial situation.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not your
weight's a problem.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.910 align:middle line:90%
How you make decisions.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Your spiritual advancement and
access to your spiritual gifts.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of effect for
something you can't really see.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So ideally you know you want
your chakras spinning gently

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:90%
in a certain direction.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.660 align:middle line:84%
You want them to be free from
clogged up or stagnant energy.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.230 align:middle line:84%
An energy healer can sense
the state of your chakras.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
They can sense your
personal energy field

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and see how it's interacting
with the unified bigger energy

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:84%
field that surrounds and
inner penetrates yours.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Now if you're like
me, you're one

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
of those millions of people that
has already attuned themselves

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level
of consciousness.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I bet you've already
done some major clearing

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:84%
work on your energy system,
perhaps through meditation,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:84%
or energy healing, or maybe
by walking on the beach.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:15.050 align:middle line:84%
But one way or another, you're
ready to go to the next level.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:84%
If you'll allow me
to be your guide,

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take you on a
really exciting ride today

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
into the upper atmosphere of
your consciousness to charge up

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and activate your
connection to spirit.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So the 8th chakra
is the first of what

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:90%
we call the spiritual chakras.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe a foot or
two above your head,

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:90%
above your crown chakra.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the chakra of divine
love and spiritual compassion.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It also holds all your karmic
stuff, the habitual patterns

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:84%
of energy that you've clung
to lifetime after lifetime.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So when your 8th
chakra opens up,

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.350 align:middle line:84%
like it will with
this activation,

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel a new sense
of spiritual awareness

00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and your connection will be made
to a vast spiritual community.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you'll be able to
connect with your higher self

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.320 align:middle line:84%
every moment for the
guidance that you want.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.490 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to work
here with color.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:84%
The 8th chakra's
color is a little bit

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:90%
like ultraviolet light.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But you can imagine,
if you like,

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
a very deep violet light with
spiraling bands of green in it.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.420 align:middle line:90%
So let's get started.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a deep
breath in through your nose

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.474 align:middle line:84%
and exhale out through
your mouth, like this.

00:31:27.474 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:90%
[DEEP BREATH]

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.170 align:middle line:84%
You're going to release
any tension or stress.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:34.932 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it again.

00:31:34.932 --> 00:31:39.090 align:middle line:90%
[DEEP BREATH]

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.034 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it one more time.

00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:43.250 align:middle line:90%
[DEEP BREATH]

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And that last breath
you're releasing any fear

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.500 align:middle line:90%
you might have been holding.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.830 align:middle line:90%
There you go, beautiful.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Now as you can see here,
there's no reason to be fearful.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I've covered you in an auric
egg-shaped golden light

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:04.430 align:middle line:84%
of protection that
repels all negativity.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Now as you stay focused
on the images that

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.650 align:middle line:84%
are in front of you,
first, bring your attention

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.060 align:middle line:90%
to your base chakra.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the root energy center.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
imagine a vast field

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.720 align:middle line:90%
of a beautiful bright red color.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:84%
The color of the center of
the earth, a volcanic color.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Now moving up slightly
to your second chakra,

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
midway between your
base and your waist.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful orange color.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.960 align:middle line:90%
It's right at the sacrum.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And now moving up
again above your

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.200 align:middle line:90%
waist to your third chakra.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful yellow color.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:47.110 align:middle line:84%
It's right in the center,
it's your solar plexus.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And now moving up again
into your heart chakra,

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.730 align:middle line:84%
which is right in the
center of your chest.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.090 align:middle line:90%
A beautiful Kelly green color.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to take
you to your thymus, the seat

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:90%
of your spiritual development.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:84%
You'll find it halfway
between your heart

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.350 align:middle line:90%
chakra and your throat chakra.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Just focus on it
internally for a moment.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And from there I'll take
you to the throat chakra,

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:84%
it's right in the
center of your throat.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.590 align:middle line:90%
A beautiful vibrant blue color.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.384 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll move to the very
center of your forehead,

00:33:23.384 --> 00:33:24.550 align:middle line:90%
right between your eyebrows.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.500 align:middle line:90%
The lilac of your third eye.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I take you to
the very top of your head.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Using your intention,
just visualize it.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:84%
The white gold chakra
right at the very top

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.480 align:middle line:90%
of your head, your crown chakra.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And following my voice and
using my intentionality

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm opening your
body chakras now.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm opening them both in
the front and in the rear.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
take you higher.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:08.369 align:middle line:84%
I want you to imagine a silver
cord coming up from your crown

00:34:08.369 --> 00:34:11.820 align:middle line:84%
chakra and just
disappearing up into the sky

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:84%
above in the upper
reaches of infinity.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:84%
This cord is your connection
to the higher dimensions.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So gently allow
your consciousness

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.409 align:middle line:84%
to go up that cord
until it's about two,

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.920 align:middle line:84%
or maybe three feet
above your head.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And visualize a door opening
into a beautiful light infused

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The room is just bathed in
the splendor of this light.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.429 align:middle line:84%
And how it looks to
you is up to you.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Just use your imagination.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So here in this room you're
meeting your higher self.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:84%
What will you say to this being
who's perfect in every respect?

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's who you really are.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Perfect in the eyes of
spirit, and in my eyes.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you have questions
for your higher self?

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you'd like
your higher self

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to guide you to
the akashic records

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to better understand the energy
patterns that have been created

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
over many lifetimes
that need cleansing now.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you'd like to get
a better grasp on your soul

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.600 align:middle line:90%
contract, or your life purpose.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:84%
This 8th chakra to which
you are now connected

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:28.590 align:middle line:84%
holds all that
information for you.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel the fullness
of this spiritual energy center

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
available to you
right here, right now.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And using my intentionality
combined with yours,

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.810 align:middle line:84%
we're gently bringing that
information, that energy,

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:84%
down the cord and
into your crown chakra

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.510 align:middle line:84%
where it can download
into your body,

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:84%
allowing your body to merge
with all that information.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Feel it coming all the way
down, down, down your body

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.720 align:middle line:84%
through every chakra
until it's finally

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.720 align:middle line:90%
in the soles of your feet.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And allow it to anchor
into the earth below.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.290 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're in this
enlightened and empowered

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.126 align:middle line:84%
state, what all is
possible for you?

00:36:18.126 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:84%
What blocks or
limitations do you

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.740 align:middle line:84%
want to just to
allow to fade away?

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.550 align:middle line:84%
What is becoming clear to
you about your own life?

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Notice how you feel different.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.770 align:middle line:90%
You feel more open.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:90%
More connected.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.720 align:middle line:90%
More joyful.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So this sensation you are now
learning to do for yourself.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:90%
You can recreate this.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And soon you'll be
able to recreate it

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:84%
for your loved ones, and one
day even for complete strangers.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can benefit
from the wonders

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.100 align:middle line:84%
of this powerful 8th
chakra energy healing.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all the good you'll be
doing out there in the world

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:84%
once you've tapped
into these abilities

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and share this gift
with those in need.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So now I'll take
a moment and I'll

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.350 align:middle line:84%
ensure that your
8th chakra is open.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to recognize
this powerful first step

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:17.935 align:middle line:84%
on a transformational journey
to realizing your true energy

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:18.435 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:37:18.435 --> 00:37:22.192 align:middle line:90%


00:37:22.192 --> 00:37:23.860 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was very helpful,
very clear, very colorful.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned a little
bit about initiation

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
before the video, what
did you mean by that?

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, let me tell
you how I first saw one

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.190 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know what
the word meant at all.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:84%
This was back when I was
following those ministers

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and rabbis around and
watching them work.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And early on in this
study, I was sitting way

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.250 align:middle line:84%
in the back of a temple and I
saw something happen up front.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I
threw myself to my knees,

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I felt this like ecstatic
joy, and I heard bells,

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and it was pretty wild.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So then I sat down and
I said to the woman

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.296 align:middle line:90%
next to me, what's going on?

00:38:04.296 --> 00:38:07.499 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh they
called out an initiation.

00:38:07.499 --> 00:38:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So I went home and
I started reading,

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.810 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard the term.

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And in the West, in all
the Western churches--

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:21.150 align:middle line:84%
all of them-- they refer
to that as an experience

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.150 align:middle line:84%
where you're getting a
higher vibration, a higher

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:90%
experience of the God-force.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And starts-- that's why
I have that 8th chakra

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:32.860 align:middle line:84%
video, because it starts with
your 8th chakra and moves up.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's not an
initiation, but opening

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:38.737 align:middle line:84%
the 8th chakra prepares
you for an initiation.

00:38:38.737 --> 00:38:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's a vibration, right?

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.947 align:middle line:90%
Again, back to that word.

00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It is.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had teachers tell
me way back in the day

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
when I was working at
that energy school,

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:50.930 align:middle line:84%
oh one day you will
initiate people.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I had just seen a
few at this point.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like right, I'm the one
that's not getting anything.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.430 align:middle line:90%
How could that be?

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:59.640 align:middle line:84%
But they assured me, and
it's come to pass, actually.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be the one
thing I do really well.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.119 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have lost so much of
that in this Western society.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: We have.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We really have.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Even when a girl
turns 13, there is

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.310 align:middle line:84%
of course the certain
traditions that

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.880 align:middle line:84%
have the-- the bar
mitzvah, bat mitzvah,

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.060 align:middle line:90%
we've got the quinceaneras.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: All initiatory rights.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what
about when you first

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.340 align:middle line:84%
have your period, when
you cycle to the moon?

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
huge step for girls

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:84%
as they're coming
into womanhood.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead right now
it's something like,

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
here's your product
that you can use.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.482 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
that talks about--

00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: There's no symbolism.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that rite of
passage into womanhood.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, and these are very
complementary spiritual rites

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:84%
of passage that we're
meant to experience,

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:90%
but that we've kind of lost.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So back when I was a young
energy healing student,

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.560 align:middle line:84%
the goal was to have
one in a lifetime.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And I fasted and prayed,
and did all the stuff

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:84%
I thought would hope make it
happen, and it finally did.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered,
then I started

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.290 align:middle line:84%
being the one who
initiated people.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Which just means I'm
a midwife, because you

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:14.125 align:middle line:90%
bring the energy in.

00:40:14.125 --> 00:40:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Let me rephrase that.

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:16.580 align:middle line:90%
You make it possible.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I can feel a readiness
in you, and then I

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.380 align:middle line:90%
reach for the energy.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I can feel it up here,
it's above your head.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
something like menopause?

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.620 align:middle line:84%
When women go--
because the change

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:90%
happens over a period of years.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.660 align:middle line:84%
How do you know when
to honor that change?

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.144 align:middle line:84%
And is it something that's
worthy of an initiation?

00:40:35.144 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I think it is.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that women are
much more wisdom bearers

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:90%
after menopause, totally.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And for me it's the best
thing that ever happened to me

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:84%
because it just threw all
these energy doors open.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.565 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe
the difference.

00:40:49.565 --> 00:40:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Takes all the pressure off.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It takes all of
the emotion out of it,

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.291 align:middle line:84%
so you can actually
make clearer decisions.

00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Totally.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And we stop functioning as
just something that-- I mean,

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I spent my whole
time pre-menopause

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.330 align:middle line:84%
worrying about what some man was
going to think of how I looked

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.260 align:middle line:90%
or what I said.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden I didn't care.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.640 align:middle line:90%
It was just delightful.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.180 align:middle line:84%
The body works in
wonderful ways.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:16.925 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It does.

00:41:16.925 --> 00:41:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For a reason.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been around
for a long time.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So what other types
of initiations

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.570 align:middle line:90%
have you helped people through?

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:27.081 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, since 2000,
since about the year 2000,

00:41:27.081 --> 00:41:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that where it
used to be that you had one

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:32.840 align:middle line:84%
in a lifetime, now Lisa,
people will have two, four.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm just amazed.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Because spirit must
discern that we as a planet

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.370 align:middle line:84%
are in a bit of a
crisis here, so they're

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.070 align:middle line:84%
sending more higher
consciousness.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what an initiation is.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:84%
In the East they call
it Kundalini Rising.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.910 align:middle line:90%
See, it's all the same.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.480 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
base chakra, and comes

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.350 align:middle line:90%
from chakras above your head.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And the higher the initiation
is, the more ecstatic.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I had one, I'll tell
you about this one.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.890 align:middle line:84%
One time I came home from energy
school, and lo and behold, just

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:84%
had one with a local
shaman in my area,

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.457 align:middle line:84%
and spent the rest of the
summer sitting in an oak tree.

00:42:12.457 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:84%
This drove my husband
crazy because he

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.456 align:middle line:84%
would leave for
work every morning

00:42:15.456 --> 00:42:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be out there
in the tree and I'm

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.610 align:middle line:84%
having an ecstatic experience
with the sun, the moon,

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:21.270 align:middle line:90%
and the stars.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And he'd come home at
night, I'd still be there.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, you've
been here, you know.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.565 align:middle line:90%
I did it all summer.

00:42:25.565 --> 00:42:28.700 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:29.415 align:middle line:90%
I was just--

00:42:29.415 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Called.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, in
this amazing energy.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What types
of initiations

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:84%
do men have in the
Western culture?

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: They have
the same kinds,

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.420 align:middle line:84%
we just don't
acknowledge them as much.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:40.795 align:middle line:84%
But they have the
very same kind.

00:42:40.795 --> 00:42:43.501 align:middle line:84%
Spiritually, I'm talking
spiritual initiations.

00:42:43.501 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
do physically, too.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.583 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
mean by spiritual,

00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:48.480 align:middle line:90%
what's that's the difference?

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, when we talk
about puberty and menopause,

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about the
physical body initiating.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And spiritual initiations are
of your energy field picking up

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.466 align:middle line:90%
a higher vibration.

00:42:58.466 --> 00:42:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: So here's how it works.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Your soul decides to have
a life and incarnate.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:08.270 align:middle line:84%
To rise to a level
it couldn't before,

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:09.609 align:middle line:90%
wherever it may have been.

00:43:09.609 --> 00:43:11.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
know where that was.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.799 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you wanted to
be loyal, or courageous,

00:43:14.799 --> 00:43:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't feel
like you mastered that.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So you come in to
have this lifetime.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Spirit gives you
challenges that you really

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:22.402 align:middle line:90%
picked ahead of time.

00:43:22.402 --> 00:43:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
we have no knowledge

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.650 align:middle line:90%
of that when we get here.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The way you handle the challenge
with the right attitude of I'll

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:84%
make lemonade out
of these lemons,

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.127 align:middle line:84%
or I'll get petty and resentful
and that's the other way.

00:43:35.127 --> 00:43:37.335 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what you take
when you take the trauma

00:43:37.335 --> 00:43:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and you turn it into something
that you can teach or learn

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:40.310 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:40.893 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:43:40.893 --> 00:43:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have the right attitude,
you're ready for an initiation.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.240 align:middle line:84%
You're ready for
a higher vibration

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.660 align:middle line:84%
to come into your energy
field and make you a higher

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.620 align:middle line:84%
spiritual being
right here on Earth.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So for example,
if someone experienced

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.320 align:middle line:84%
sexual trauma as
a child, they came

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.980 align:middle line:90%
in with this lesson to learn.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Choice.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As they start to
resolve it and start to get rid

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:05.600 align:middle line:84%
of the limitations around it, or
the pain and trauma around it,

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.240 align:middle line:84%
is that worthy of an initiation
so that someone can actually

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.369 align:middle line:90%
be free from that?

00:44:10.369 --> 00:44:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Totally, totally.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:84%
They'll be free and
they'll be able to teach

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.784 align:middle line:90%
from that place of wisdom.

00:44:14.784 --> 00:44:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And can you
have multiple things

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:18.130 align:middle line:84%
like that going on
in one lifetime?

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it's
the one big thing?

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: I think it's multiple.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, so you could then
have the same type of thing

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.435 align:middle line:84%
where it comes to
having children.

00:44:28.435 --> 00:44:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And you came in,
and you couldn't

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.060 align:middle line:90%
maybe in the last lifetime.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And in this lifetime you
came in to overcome whatever

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.510 align:middle line:84%
it is so that then
you could have

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that experience of
motherhood and birth.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.369 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: To be mothering.

00:44:39.369 --> 00:44:41.262 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, interesting.

00:44:41.262 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And same for men, they could
come in with their own types.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.132 align:middle line:84%
It could be
financial challenges.

00:44:46.132 --> 00:44:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It could be anything.

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Any challenge.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And once you've
done the work on it

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and you've resolved it through
the limiting belief elimination

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and obliterated all of
the karma around it,

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.770 align:middle line:84%
you can actually have an
initiation to step out of it.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Exactly.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:03.703 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is brilliant.

00:45:03.703 --> 00:45:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: You're
done with that one.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:06.815 align:middle line:90%
Classified.

00:45:06.815 --> 00:45:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is great.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.210 align:middle line:84%
That is a great way
to significantly

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.880 align:middle line:90%
be done with something.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And I can think of so
many different people that

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.510 align:middle line:84%
say, well, in that
segment of my life,

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:90%
and then in my later years.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So we really do it naturally,
but we don't have a ceremony

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.880 align:middle line:84%
around it to put
some closure to it.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.632 align:middle line:90%
Like we do with a funeral.

00:45:25.632 --> 00:45:27.590 align:middle line:84%
That puts closure, and
there's different things

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:84%
around the memorial services
that, really, are all

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.140 align:middle line:90%
aimed towards closure.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.137 align:middle line:84%
And that's a ceremony,
that's an initiation.

00:45:35.137 --> 00:45:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It is.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.094 align:middle line:84%
And we're taking that ceremony,
and we're compressing it.

00:45:38.094 --> 00:45:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So now we're expected to
be back at work on Monday,

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:45.520 align:middle line:84%
with one tear, don't want the
mascara to run at the funeral.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.605 align:middle line:84%
It makes it really
hard for people.

00:45:47.605 --> 00:45:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's an
initiation they

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:50.900 align:middle line:84%
could go-- it's an
initiation for the spirit.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Yeah, we
need time to grieve.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much
an initiation.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For both.

00:45:56.250 --> 00:46:02.707 align:middle line:84%
For the soul to move on, and
for the living to move through.

00:46:02.707 --> 00:46:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Right.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because moving
on doesn't happen so fast

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.090 align:middle line:90%
in that situation.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:11.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you were going to tell
us about the wildest initiation

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.730 align:middle line:90%
you've ever seen.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Could you share that
with us, or did you

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.802 align:middle line:84%
already share that
with the church?

00:46:18.802 --> 00:46:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: You know,
I've seen so many

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.607 align:middle line:84%
its really hard
for me to pick one.

00:46:22.607 --> 00:46:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But I want to tell
you about something

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I saw at John of God's that
was pretty interesting.

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I flew down there one day
with zero preparation,

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.360 align:middle line:84%
thinking that he's elderly--
you know, he's gotten older.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.940 align:middle line:90%
And I had not been there.

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And this was a long time
ago, and thought I should go.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But I like to start things
with no-- having not have read

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:48.620 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.995 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have somebody
else tell me what to think.

00:46:50.995 --> 00:46:52.926 align:middle line:90%
So I showed up knowing zip.

00:46:52.926 --> 00:46:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I walk in, and there's
people everywhere and no place

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:55.800 align:middle line:90%
to sit.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's hot.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.070 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's Brazil.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's fairly primitive.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking around, my
husband and I are together,

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, oh there's a
place to sit, no one's there.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:06.470 align:middle line:90%
So I went over and plopped down.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And about five minutes
later, John of God, who I've

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.020 align:middle line:84%
never seen before, but I
figured it out within a second.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.120 align:middle line:84%
He came in from behind
me, I was on the stage.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why no one
was sitting there.

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.262 align:middle line:84%
And I'm-- I'm right on the--
and I'm like, oh great,

00:47:19.262 --> 00:47:21.720 align:middle line:84%
great place to be, that's why
all those people are in front

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.190 align:middle line:90%
of me.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So he walks in from behind,
and he's in a altered state.

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But in a state where
he's not conscious,

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.600 align:middle line:84%
he's left his
consciousness behind.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in the green room,
or somewhere in the back.

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Which is very risky, this is
very old style energy healing.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.550 align:middle line:84%
We haven't done that in the
West since maybe the '40s.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of high
risk because you

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.310 align:middle line:84%
don't know who's going
to come in and take over

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.801 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness.

00:47:52.801 --> 00:47:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first thing I
noticed, but it was really

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.890 align:middle line:84%
interesting because he
used a form of-- also,

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:00.660 align:middle line:84%
we don't countenance
this here in the West--

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.350 align:middle line:84%
he used a form of psychic
surgery involving knives.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So he took a knife without
looking, reached for a knife

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:11.610 align:middle line:84%
off a handler's
tray, and just cut

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:84%
into this woman who was standing
next to him right behind me.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.890 align:middle line:84%
She falls into a wheelchair,
and they wheel her out.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.569 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow, this is
going to be interesting.

00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my gosh.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Like physically cut into her?

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Startling.

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of a small
pocket of energy healing.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that only done
in Haiti and in Brazil

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:40.010 align:middle line:90%
where they actually use knives.

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we want to take
a look at this next video.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about what this is about.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, in this
next video, what I'm doing

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.900 align:middle line:84%
is I'm helping you
activate your thymus gland.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all think of the thymus
as the seat of immune function,

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:56.100 align:middle line:84%
but Lisa, actually it's the seat
of our spiritual development.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's incredibly
important that it be opened.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And what we tend to
do, we in the West

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.910 align:middle line:84%
especially, is to close
it down as we get older.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:06.504 align:middle line:84%
And what this video
does is open it.

00:49:06.504 --> 00:49:07.170 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>Hi, I'm Deborah
King, and I have

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.740 align:middle line:84%
a message of awakening
for you today.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm a master energy healer
and a spiritual teacher.

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And over the last
nearly three decades,

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been fortunate enough
to practice energy healing

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and bring about real physical
change in the lives of tens

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:27.990 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people
from all around the world.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And one question that I'm asked
all the time is where do I

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.680 align:middle line:90%
get all the energy I have?

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Truly, I can work all day, every
day, and just never get tired.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I just seem to get
more energized.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So you may be
wondering yourself,

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.130 align:middle line:84%
how you could access
all this energy?

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm going to share
what seems like a simple,

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.690 align:middle line:84%
but is actually
extremely profound

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and powerful technique
with you that you

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.710 align:middle line:84%
can use in your daily
life just like I do.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you become an
energy healer like me,

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.970 align:middle line:84%
it will be an essential
one for you to have.

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So this process is
designed to activate

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.710 align:middle line:84%
a key point in your body
and your energy field that

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:12.890 align:middle line:84%
will open and clear your
channel to the unified field

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:16.710 align:middle line:84%
of all energy, also
known as the divine.

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And it will allow you
to focus your abilities

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
masters of the universe.

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:23.010 align:middle line:90%


00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So to do this, I'm going to
attract, connect, and transmit

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:33.030 align:middle line:84%
a field of energy to you that
will awaken your inner energy

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.120 align:middle line:90%
healer.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.560 align:middle line:84%
For this exercise you want
to focus your attention

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.240 align:middle line:84%
on your thymus
gland, right here.

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Why the thymus, you might ask?

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a super
important place.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the seat of your
spiritual development.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.420 align:middle line:84%
When it's open, and
expanded, and getting bigger,

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.960 align:middle line:84%
your thymus acts like a
beacon that lets all the

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.510 align:middle line:84%
higher entities in the
vast spiritual realm

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:59.270 align:middle line:84%
know that you're
working for the light.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:01.910 align:middle line:84%
It becomes your
personal signature.

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So your thymus is
located just midway

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:07.330 align:middle line:84%
between your heart chakra, which
is in the center of your chest,

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and your throat chakra, which
is in the center of your throat.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.680 align:middle line:90%
It's right in between.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.030 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it a little bit.

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:15.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
rounded, it sticks out

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.210 align:middle line:90%
a bit from your chest wall.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't feel it, some
people's are hard to discern,

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:21.580 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.750 align:middle line:90%
You just imagine you can.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to use
my unbending intent,

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm trained to do this, to
activate your thymus today.

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm just using intentionality,
but in a very significant way.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, I'm reaching
out to you energetically

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.160 align:middle line:90%
and activating it now.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
visualize your thymus

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:49.410 align:middle line:84%
like it's a flower, the
color of pink quartz.

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Feel it now, opening
and expanding.

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And opening wider,
and expanding further.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.140 align:middle line:84%
You might feel
warmth in the area.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:02.150 align:middle line:84%
You might sense a
fluttering little feeling.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you'll
feel like you're

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:06.470 align:middle line:90%
wrapped in soft pink color.

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:08.460 align:middle line:84%
There's no right
way or wrong way

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.640 align:middle line:84%
to feel what's happening
to you right now.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.665 align:middle line:84%
Just let it be, and know
that it's occurring.

00:52:14.665 --> 00:52:22.710 align:middle line:90%


00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So you've probably read
that your thymus began

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:28.290 align:middle line:84%
to shrink about the
time you were 16,

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:31.800 align:middle line:84%
but now you've reversed that
dynamic and yours is opening

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and expanding because
I've just activated it.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, or perhaps
a night soon,

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.027 align:middle line:84%
you may wake up and feel
it tapping or pulsing.

00:52:41.027 --> 00:52:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't want
you to worry, that's

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:43.693 align:middle line:90%
actually a very good sign.

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:46.710 align:middle line:84%
My thymus pulsed
like that for years.

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.850 align:middle line:84%
As your thymus continues
to open and expand,

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:53.700 align:middle line:84%
you'll start to receive
special initiations

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.330 align:middle line:90%
into higher spiritual levels.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:58.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to prepare
for those initiations.

00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really, really
significant activation.

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.730 align:middle line:84%
This thymus opening also
allows you to become aware of,

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and start to use your
unique spiritual gifts.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:13.135 align:middle line:84%
And you have some very unique
gifts that are just for you.

00:53:13.135 --> 00:53:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what your gifts are?

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can hear things or
see things on other planes.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're very
persuasive and you

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:24.280 align:middle line:90%
can help people in that regard.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you have
the gift of healing,

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and it just needs
to be activated.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Every person has their
own unique gifts.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Just keep allowing your thymus
to open as you hear my voice.

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to,
you can very, very,

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.860 align:middle line:84%
very gently tap on it and
intend for it to open further.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:48.880 align:middle line:90%


00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So the thymus is
not only the seat

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:52.410 align:middle line:90%
of your spiritual development.

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:56.190 align:middle line:84%
As you know, it's also the
seat of your immune function.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:59.000 align:middle line:84%
If your thymus got
overwhelmed or fatigued

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.300 align:middle line:84%
by a lot of heavy emotion, it
can interfere with your health.

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.460 align:middle line:90%
So today's the day.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:08.150 align:middle line:84%
You want it to be open and
charged from here on out.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find this process
not only serves as a way

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.330 align:middle line:84%
to protect you and
keep you healthy,

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:15.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's also an
expert level way

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to prepare yourself to give
powerful energy healings.

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Now as I initiate you into
higher and higher planes

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:27.640 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit, I want you to
continue to use this technique

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.930 align:middle line:84%
to activate and supercharge
your spiritual development.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:34.580 align:middle line:84%
This will strengthen
your bond to the pantheon

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.910 align:middle line:84%
of light workers that
have proceeded you.

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:37.840 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so we just learned
how to open the thymus,

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.930 align:middle line:84%
but do you ever
recommend closing it,

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:45.240 align:middle line:90%
or does it just stay open?

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: It stays open.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And the more that
you-- and you can

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.510 align:middle line:90%
replay this video, by the way.

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
replay it and focus

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.590 align:middle line:84%
on opening your own
thymus, the better.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:56.640 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it enhances
your health and your immune.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, it prepares
you for higher initiations,

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:00.030 align:middle line:90%
it really does.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.442 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting,
fascinating.

00:55:02.442 --> 00:55:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot
about energy medicine,

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and initiation, and
karma, and everything.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Where can people learn a little
bit more about what you teach?

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.993 align:middle line:84%
>>KING: Well, just swing
over to deborahkingcenter.com

00:55:13.993 --> 00:55:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of
click around there.

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And people can learn,
go through classes, courses,

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:20.760 align:middle line:84%
watch the videos,
whatever it is.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So that they can
actually-- but you really

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:25.240 align:middle line:84%
have such a clear way of
explaining everything,

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.190 align:middle line:90%
so I really appreciate it.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.280 align:middle line:84%
As much as I'm immersed
in energy medicine,

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I've learned several
new things today.

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:32.775 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:55:32.775 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Excellent, thank you.

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I appreciate that.

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KING: Really fun being here.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:38.301 align:middle line:84%
