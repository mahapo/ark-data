>>LISA GARR: Hi,
I'm you Lisa Garr,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.390 align:middle line:10%
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.137 align:middle line:10%
And our topic for
this series, which

00:00:17.137 --> 00:00:19.220 align:middle line:10%
we're taping at the Celebrate
Your Life Conference

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:10%
in Phoenix, Arizona, is to
explore the "I Am" meaning.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is world
renowned Toltec teacher,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:84%
don Miguel Ruiz, who wrote
"The Four Agreements" that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
spent over seven years on the
New York Times bestseller list.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And "The Four Agreements"
has transformed the lives

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of millions of people
with four simple messages

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.770 align:middle line:90%
that we will explore.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DON MIGUEL RUIZ: Well,
Lisa, it's always my pleasure

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.126 align:middle line:90%
to be in your shows.

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, every time I see
you, I have the same reaction,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:90%
is I burst into tears.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this when
I saw you at a conference,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:90%
oh, many, many, many years ago.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It was for the Transformational
Leadership Council.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And I saw you on the
side of the room.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And you gave me a hug,
and we stood there

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:90%
for it felt like 30 minutes.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And you embraced me.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:90%
And I cried.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And every time I see you, I
have this opening-- this heart

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:90%
chakra opening.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- I'm very,
very grateful to be with you.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Do people have that
reaction a lot with you?

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:10%
>>RUIZ: Well, I may say
that I'm like a mirror.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:10%
>>RUIZ: And what you
see is your own love.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:10%
You can see yourself,
and you just

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:10%
love to see what you really
are, because we are not

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:10%
what we pretend to be.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have explored
the meaning of the heart so

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
thoroughly, all the way
from your experience

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.840 align:middle line:84%
in having a full heart
attack and going through what

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:90%
you've gone through.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
What is your vision of
that entire experience?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:84%
You have a different perspective
on your heart attack,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.800 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.455 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, the whole
thing is really just a story.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful and beautiful
story, but it's just a story.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's only true
for me, of course.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'm one of the 7
billion people who create

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:90%
a story every single moment.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And everyone, they live
in their own story.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Then this story is
about to show everybody

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
the real conflict that exists
in the human mind, which

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is in the story that we create,
that for millenniums, we

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
used that believe that
was between good and bad,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
when the truth is that this
conflict is between the truth

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:90%
and lies.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Then we are good when
we believe in truth.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
We are bad when we believe
in lies in different degrees.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Because we can say that a lie is
just a distortion of the truth,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:90%
or an image of the truth.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as we
believe in that,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
we corrupt and we
create a superstition.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And superstitions,
sometimes, they

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:90%
have very strong superstitions.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the need to
defend all those superstitions.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And we become fanatic
defendants of superstition,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
trying to impose the
superstitions to our self

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:90%
and to everybody around us.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
conflict that exists

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.326 align:middle line:90%
in every single human story.

00:03:27.326 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Then in my heart
attack, in that story,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that's what I present--
the conflict that

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
exists in Miguel's mind,
the truth versus lies.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was the truth
and what was the lie?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, the
truth always exists.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
The truth existed long before
the creation of humanity.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
It will exists long after
the extinction of humanity.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The truth doesn't
need to be proved

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't need that we humans
believe or not in the truth.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:90%
It just exists.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, the
lies only exists because we

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:90%
believe in those lies.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we give life to all
those lies and we defend them,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:90%
all those lies.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The lie that you had
in your space at the time,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:84%
did that contribute to
the breaking of your heart

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
or the interruption
in your heart?

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
What were you
experiencing at that time?

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, no, no,
no, no, not at all.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I had a heart attack just
because my body is matter.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And every single
human will die in one

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and another circumstance.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Then that was my turn to die.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.841 align:middle line:84%
Then as least we can say
that two things are truth.

00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: One is life.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We are alive, and we cannot
deny that life exists.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:90%
We'll be denying of our self.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:90%
And the other is death.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
We cannot deny that death exists
because we all will die sooner

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
or later.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And let's say in a
hundred, a hundred and ten

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:90%
years, none of us will be here.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We'll be brand new humans
all around the world,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:90%
all around the Earth.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Then for sure, these
two things are true.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, the entire manifestation,
all the creation,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but interaction
between life and death,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:90%
between matter and energy.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Because death is matter.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Life is energy.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And as we know,
matter only moves

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
when a force moves
matter and only can start

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:90%
when the forces start matter.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But matter by
itself cannot move.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Matter has a creation
and has a destruction.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, energy
cannot be destroyed--

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
only transformed, but
never can be destroyed.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And we are life, living
in the matter which

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:90%
is our physical body.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Then depends which
point of view we'll use,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about
the same topic.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the life
force moves the matter,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
and that's called life.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But energy exists
beyond the matter,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.380 align:middle line:90%
and that's called death.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: OK.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Life is the energy that
moves our physical body.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Our physical body has
been dead since the moment

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:90%
of our conception.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:90%
We live in a dead body.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It's alive because we
give life to that body.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Then who is we?

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, honestly,
I am not the matter.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But I am the life who moves
matter, which is energy.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Energy and life is
exactly the same thing.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Then with that point of view,
I can see that I am immortal,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:90%
but not my body.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
A body will live maybe a
hundred years-- very short time,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
extremely short time compared
with the infinity of time.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
You just said such
a beautiful thing.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
We were talking earlier
about the I am statement,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and you just said,
I am immortal.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: I can say
that I am is talking

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
about your authenticity, not
what you believe you are.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And to show that, I will bring
one of my biggest heroes,

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.525 align:middle line:90%
Popeye the sailor.

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK. [LAUGHS].

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: He say, I am what I am.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:90%
That's all what I am.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, that's true.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: He doesn't say that
he knows who he is, no.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:84%
He says, that's what
I am, and that's it.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Take it or leave it.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:90%
This is what I am.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am what I am,
Popeye the sailor. [LAUGHS].

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:90%
That's Toltec wisdom for you.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.357 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.357 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: It's simple.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
life is simple.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:90%
We complicate everything.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that is very true.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So I am what I am, and
that's all that there is.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Mhm, that's
all what I am.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's all you are.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:84%
When you wrote "The
Four Agreements"--

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and you can tell us
the four of them,

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
because they are a very simple.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
They are very exactly what you
said-- they are what they are.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.309 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: We can see that
these four agreements is

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:84%
the instrument that
the truth uses in order

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:90%
for us to change our life.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Then the four agreements
is the introduction

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
of the way of knowledge
of the Toltec.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Toltec means artist.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:90%
We all are artists.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Then the eye of the artist
is always looking for beauty.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:07.247 align:middle line:84%
And just to perceive that
beauty makes us so happy.

00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Then this four agreements
is the institution

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:90%
of this way of life.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And with these
four agreements, we

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:90%
change the story of our life.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We practice until we no longer
believe in our own story.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is when we practice the
fifth agreement-- be skeptical,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:90%
but learn to listen.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
skeptical because we

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
know that our story is not
true, but nobody else's story

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:90%
is real or true.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But they have the
right to express

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.221 align:middle line:84%
what they will believe
as we have the right

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:90%
to express what we believe.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Then we are skeptical because
we know that what they say

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
is true for them, but
not necessarily for us.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But we listen because they
can say so wonderful things,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:90%
so many truths.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:10%
And we can take it and use it
to change our own story, which

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:10%
is exactly the purpose
of this beautiful book,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:10%
"The Toltec Art of
Life and Death."

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:10%
I expose this story
with the conflict

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:10%
that exists in the mind.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reader can
see the parallel

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:90%
with their own creation.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And they can see the conflict
that they have in their life.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And the way how I deal
with all those lies, all

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
those superstitions, they
can do exactly the same thing

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:90%
with theirs.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Then, yes, this particular book
is about the story of the nine

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.260 align:middle line:90%
weeks that I was in coma.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But that applies
to everybody else.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And in these nine weeks,
the most important memories

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.030 align:middle line:84%
is the encounters
with the truth.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Because every time that I have
an encounter with the truth,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Toltec
superstitions just disappear.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Because they need that
I believe in those

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:90%
truths in order to survive.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I see the
truth, I no longer

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
believe in all those lies
and all those superstitions.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And they just disappear.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And the result is that the
story of my life changed.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I create more and more of
my own personal heaven.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And with every encounter
with the truth,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
lots of superstitions
disappear, and my life

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
becomes better, and
better, and better.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point
that I like that whoever

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
reads that book apply
it into their own life,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:84%
that they have the courage to
face their own superstitions

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
by using the truth.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And they will see how the story
of their life also will change.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By saying
superstitions, you

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.730 align:middle line:84%
mean the lies in
our space, things

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.117 align:middle line:84%
that we believe that
are not real, right?

00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, there's so
many superstitions in all

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:90%
the different directions.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
There's superstition
in science, in art,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
in painting, in
religion, in politics.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.365 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you give
me an example of some

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:58.890 align:middle line:90%
of those superstition in art?

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, there's
so many of those.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:90%
For example, I believe in God.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:90%
My god is better than your god.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.790 align:middle line:84%
You should believe in my
god, or you will be condemned

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.395 align:middle line:84%
and you will live
in hell forever.

00:12:13.395 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And if you
don't believe in my god,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I may help you with
that, and I will

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.660 align:middle line:90%
make you believe in my god.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, yes.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, great point.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Superstition in, you
said, art, politics--

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.020 align:middle line:90%
superstitions in politics.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm starting to see
where those come through, yes.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: And sports.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Explain.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, I
defend the Green Bay,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:90%
let's say-- Green Bay Packers.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.123 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm, it's a competition.

00:12:41.123 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Mhm.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:90%
And my heart is with them.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm willing to
die or kill defending

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
in the colors of the Green Bay,
or the Patriots or whoever.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's so
interesting, yes.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So these are the superstitions
in our space-- anything

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:90%
that isn't the truth.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, we have
to see our fanacticism--

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: --because this is how
we defend our superstitions.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
First we have to see that
there are superstitions.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Almost everything becomes a
superstition-- very little

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:90%
and very strong superstitions.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We can see in the news how
all what's happened, people

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:90%
defending their superstitions.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, I was
just thinking about that.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: --in all
different directions.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They believe
that is their truth.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And the main problem
is how we learn to love.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:90%
That is the main problem.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we learn to love the
way that our family loves,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:90%
the way our society loves.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:90%
And they love with conditions.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:90%
That is the main problem.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Then I love you if you
let me control you.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
If you do whatever I want
you to do, then I love you.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
And if not, I will reject you.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:90%
This is how I love everybody.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But this is how
everybody loves me.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
They love me if
they can control me.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Then we can see that interaction
with everybody around.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But the main problem is that we
learn to love our self exactly

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:90%
the same way.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:90%
I love myself with conditions.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not opted to be
the way I should be,

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:90%
then I don't know myself.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:90%
I reject myself.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And I create all
those limitations.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
When we understand
this point, we

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
understand all the injustice
that exists in humanity--

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:90%
all the violence, even war.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just
thinking about that.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
The superstition that one
must be under win-- and this

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
is an extreme example, but when
they die in the name of God,

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:90%
or they kill in the name of God.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So these are people
who truly believe

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
that this is a religious
experience, to kill

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
another person or
a group of people

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.290 align:middle line:90%
in the name of their god.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So that is what
they see as truth.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that the
truth is completely skewed.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Yes, you can see that
the biggest superstition there

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
is that belief in
God and how they

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:11.320 align:middle line:84%
have to be anything with their
religion, and the fanaticism

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that we have that we are
willing to kill or die for.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I'd like
people to see in this book--

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
how we break with all those
superstitious, how the belief

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:30.150 align:middle line:84%
system starts shifting until
the belief system supports

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:90%
everything that we do.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Because knowledge is
the greatest thing.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to knowledge,
we went to the moon.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
We create all those
great computers.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful what
knowledge can do.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But knowledge have all
those superstitious also

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and creates all those
limitations for us.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Then in that conflict, we can
see how the main character

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
is using the truth to face
all those superstitions

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge to break
it in an alliance

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:90%
that they do by the end.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
We can see easily the
redemption of knowledge

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:84%
because knowledge is neither
good or bad, or right or wrong.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It's all the lies that controls
knowledge and all those lies

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
who control our personal life.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Hm, ultimately, it's
about the truth and the lies.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:24.674 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Yes.

00:16:24.674 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I want
to take a look here

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.670 align:middle line:84%
at a video about "The Four
Agreements" by don Miguel Ruiz.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.616 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:84%
-What you are seeing
and hearing right now

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:90%
is nothing but a dream.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
You're dreaming right
now in this moment.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:84%
You're dreaming with
the brain awake.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.319 align:middle line:84%
Before we were born,
the humans before us

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:84%
created a big
outside dream that we

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:11.655 align:middle line:84%
will call society's dream,
or the dream of the planet.

00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:84%
The dream of the planet
includes all of society's rules,

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:21.694 align:middle line:84%
its beliefs, its
laws, its religions,

00:17:21.694 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
its different cultures
and ways to be,

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:84%
its government, schools,
social events, and holidays.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.535 align:middle line:84%
The outside dream
has so many rules

00:17:31.535 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that when a new human is born,
we hook the child's attention

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and introduce these rules
into his or her mind.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.440 align:middle line:84%
As children, we didn't
have the opportunity

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to choose our
beliefs, but we agreed

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
with the information that was
passed to us from the dream

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of the planet via other humans.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I call this process the
domestication of humans.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:84%
We trust what we
believe, and our beliefs

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:90%
set us up for suffering.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:84%
In the dream of the planet, it
is normal for humans to suffer,

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
to live in fear and
create emotional dramas.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Our personal dream can also
become an ongoing nightmare

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
where we suffer and
live in a state of fear.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need to
dream a nightmare.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to
enjoy a pleasant dream.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands
of agreements

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:84%
you have made with
yourself, with other people,

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
with God, with society, with
your parents, with your spouse,

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:90%
with your children.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But the most
important agreements

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.716 align:middle line:84%
are the ones you
made with yourself.

00:18:46.716 --> 00:18:50.320 align:middle line:84%
In these agreements, you
tell yourself who you are,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
what you feel, what you
believe, and how to behave.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
One single agreement
is not such a problem.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But we have many agreements
that make us suffer,

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.335 align:middle line:90%
that make us fail in life.

00:19:04.335 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:84%
If you want to live a life
of joy and fulfillment,

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:84%
you have to find the courage
to break those agreements that

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:84%
are fear-based and claim
your personal power.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:10%
When we're finally ready
to change our agreements,

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:10%
there are four very
powerful agreements

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:10%
that will help us break those
agreements that come from fear

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:10%
and deplete our energy.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:10%
You need a very
strong will in order

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:10%
to adopt the four agreements.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you can begin
to live your life

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:84%
with these agreements, the
transformation in your life

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.399 align:middle line:90%
will be amazing.

00:19:44.399 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:90%

because that talked

00:20:13.998 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:90%
about moving beyond our story.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you about the
book, "The Toltec Way

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:90%
of Living and Dying."

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
What do you perceive as death
from a perspective of people

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:84%
who have lost loved ones,
who are grieving and mourning

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:90%
from that loss?

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.112 align:middle line:90%
What is your perspective?

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, we can see that
they live in their own story.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.542 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Mhm.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.801 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:43.799 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so painful.

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: We populate
this story with a lot

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:90%
of secondary characters.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And every character
of our story is really

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:90%
an extension of our self.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Like in my story,
there is my mother.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:90%
There's my children.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
There's my friends,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
But all of them is just
an extension of myself.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a copy of the real one.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:90%
The real ones exists.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I have a mother.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I have my children.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that live in my
story, in my mind, in my dream,

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
they're just images, is
what I believe about them.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And in my story,
I will be so hurt

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.190 align:middle line:90%
if I will not see them anymore.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: It's not
because they die or not.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:84%
It's because what I will
feel about their death.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Then many times,
we have relatives

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that are extremely sick that
they live in pain, that they

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
hardly can wait to let go
of their physical body.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:90%
But we don't want them to go.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't feel what they feel.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sometimes, they
don't want to go either,

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:90%
and they don't understand.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Oh, yes.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:90%
That's true, of course.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, they
don't understand,

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.600 align:middle line:90%
and they're afraid of death.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Exactly.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if someone
is afraid of death,

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.061 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:22:06.061 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, we are
afraid of the unknown.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, we
can say knowledge

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:90%
is afraid of the unknown.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.686 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And knowledge is
just a reflection of life.

00:22:17.686 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:84%
The whole story's a
reflection of life.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that even real?

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And knowledge believes that
it is the physical body.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Because we see it all the time.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:90%
We feel it.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
We create emotions,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:90%
But we are not physical body.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Then the way we see that
is completely different.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you were
in the coma, what

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
was your experience of
what would be called death?

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:90%
What is your experience?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, I was so excited
when I had the heart attack.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.975 align:middle line:84%
For in the morning, I
woke up with a strong pain

00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:90%
in the chest.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm
a medical doctor.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a heart attack.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of symptoms is
that you know you're dying.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It's the sensation of death.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.556 align:middle line:90%
My head is, this is it.

00:23:09.556 --> 00:23:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I had a strong pain,
but I was very excited.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, finally, I will
have the experience

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:90%
how to leave my physical body.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And because
of course, before I

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
knew I'm not a
physical body-- I had

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.936 align:middle line:90%
many other experiences before.

00:23:25.936 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I completely cannot separate
from my physical body.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, my physical
body is my home,

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
my sanctuary where I live,
and I honor and I respect.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But to live in my physical body,
it was the greatest experience,

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and I want everybody
to see that experience,

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:90%
to learn from that experience.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, just a little
before that I

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.740 align:middle line:84%
go to coma, my middle
son don Jose Ruiz,

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:57.090 align:middle line:90%
he came to see me from Malibu.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:90%
I was in San Diego.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And we just came back
from a journey to Tijuana

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
where I teach all
my apprentices.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.394 align:middle line:84%
And I was so happy
when he came to see me.

00:24:10.394 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted-- but
then, I see his face.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I start talking, and
everything changed.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:90%
I see that he was grieving.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:90%
He was afraid.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
He tells me, father,
please, don't die.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave me alone.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.855 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ready yet.

00:24:29.855 --> 00:24:33.515 align:middle line:84%
And then my smile
changed a little.

00:24:33.515 --> 00:24:35.180 align:middle line:90%
It was a little more severe.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:84%
I look into his
eyes and say, Jose,

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:84%
is this the way that
you will celebrate

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.285 align:middle line:90%
the death of your father?

00:24:42.285 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] Oh, god.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Get out of the room.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Fix yourself, and come back.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I have something
very important to tell you.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:90%
It was a big shock for him.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And anyway, he went out.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And all [INAUDIBLE] in
his mind right away.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It shift places.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.430 align:middle line:84%
In his imagination, he
was the one who was dying,

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and I was the one who come a
say, please don't die, my son.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.477 align:middle line:84%
What am I going
to do without you?

00:25:16.477 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And he go, in fact,
a littler further.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:90%
He already was dead.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And he saw me stop
writing, and start

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:84%
traveling, and just
feeling sorry for myself,

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and just crying and crying
because I don't see him

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Then in his imagination,
he has just a few moments

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:44.020 align:middle line:84%
to talk to me before he leaves
forever, and say, father, stop.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:90%
I am completely happy.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I have no problems anymore.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything is great.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm calm.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:90%
But you are alive.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Live your life.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Keep doing what you know to
do, what gives you the passion.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.410 align:middle line:84%
After that, then he
came back into the room.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:90%
He grabbed my hand.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:84%
He kissed my hand, and
say, father, I am with you.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:90%
I understand now.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:09.825 align:middle line:90%
I've been so selfish.

00:26:09.825 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Please forgive me.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking just about me.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that perhaps
it's the very last time

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and you're so happy, I was
taking your happiness away

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.021 align:middle line:84%
from you, just because
of my selfishness.

00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a beautiful
story, and it's true.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
We do give ourselves that
story of when someone dies.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing-- and
we just lost Wayne Dyer,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:84%
who's a strong mentor of mine
and an incredible friend.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I still-- in my mind, my
story is, it was too soon.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.400 align:middle line:90%
It was too soon.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.220 align:middle line:84%
He really had so much more
life in him, I believed.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And I know that's my story.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But when we lose someone
too soon-- a child,

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, who leaves
this world without fully

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:84%
living a life-- that story
is so hard to let go of.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
very strong story.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:90%
How do you teach people to--

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Well, it's very simple.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
As you're saying, you're
talking about your story.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: It's your story.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not fair that
he's just gone.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.666 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: The Wayne Dyer
that you know is only

00:27:28.666 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:90%
what you believe about him.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.090 align:middle line:90%
It's an extension of you.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not really him.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:40.102 align:middle line:84%
And yes, his physical body
died, but he is immortal.

00:27:40.102 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: True, but what about a
child who didn't live a life?

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RUIZ: Same thing.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Well, of course, same
thing-- exactly the same thing.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Life is eternal.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:90%
He was giving life to the child.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we can
live a few minutes.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:90%
We could live maybe a month.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we can
make it to birth.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we can die
at 10 years, at 20.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:90%
It's happening all the time.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It's life pushing matter,
giving life to matter.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's billions
everywhere, all the time.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to see which
point of view are we using.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:84%
When we use the point of
view of our own story,

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
we used to believe that
none of that is fair.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:90%
But it's not true.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just a story.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not even real.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you believe
and not necessarily is true.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It's some of the superstitions
that we have because truly,

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:84%
you never knew the
real Wayne Dyer.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
You only know what
you believe about him,

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:90%
what he meant to do you.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.833 align:middle line:84%

it's everything about me.

00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:90%

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

>>RUIZ: It's is all about me.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's what my son Jose saw.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh god, it was my selfishness.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.957 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, you could
look at that any way,

00:29:12.957 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:90%
even the death of a child.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Then, for me,
it's a celebration.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.140 align:middle line:84%
He don't have to deal
with that any longer.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:84%
He already lived his legacy--
wonderful books, videos,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Teachings, yes.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: And that helped
to change humanity.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.375 align:middle line:84%
Then in the time that he
was in a physical body,

00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:34.175 align:middle line:90%
he was wonderful.

00:29:34.175 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:90%
He was great.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But only he knew exactly
what happened in his story.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else does.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's also life working
in a physical body.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I do-- I
love what you said about

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:84%
that life is truly immortal,
that he is truly immortal.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:90%
And a--

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RUIZ: Then he didn't
die, but his body did.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.920 align:middle line:84%

wouldn't either.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.402 align:middle line:84%
