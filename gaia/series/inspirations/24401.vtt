00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And we are coming to live
from the Gaiam Studios

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:90%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:10%
And since this is a
live, interactive show,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:10%
I encourage you to connect with
us through Facebook, Twitter.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:10%
Many of you already are, so
keep the comments and questions

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:10%
coming in throughout the show.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:10%
So what if I told you
there was one thing that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:10%
could fight disease, that could
clean up oil spills, that could

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:10%
even help save
the energy crisis.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Would you believe me?

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Would you believe my guest,
award winning mycologist,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Paul Stamets?

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Paul has been a dedicated
mycologist for over 30 years.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And over this time, he's
discovered and co-authored

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%
for new species of mushrooms.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's pioneered
countless techniques

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
in the fields of edible and
medicinal mushroom cultivation.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And his mission is to
make a course change

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in the evolution of this planet,
which is not a small task.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL STAMETS: Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.948 align:middle line:90%
Honor to be here.

00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's medicinal
mushroom cultivation.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.214 align:middle line:90%
It's quite a task.

00:01:17.214 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for being here.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.713 align:middle line:90%
How did you get started in this?

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:84%
What piqued your
curiosity early on?

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:10%
>>STAMETS: Well,
thinking back, when

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:10%
I was about five years of age,
I grew up in northern Ohio

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:10%
on Lake Erie.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:10%
And in the summertime,
we had lots of rains.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:10%
And these little white puff
ball mushrooms would come up.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:10%
And my twin brother
and I discovered

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:10%
that when we'd throw
them out each other,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:10%
they'd explode, the spores.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we pelted each other with
puff balls as much as we could.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I remember my mother
coming out and saying,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
don't let those spores get
into your twin brother's eyes.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.892 align:middle line:90%
If they do, he'll become blind.

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, she went back
into the house.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.058 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that
was good information.

00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So I pelted my twin brother with
as many puff balls as possible.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But my parents were
not mycophobic, per se.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Mycophobia is the
fear of mushrooms.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
not-- it makes sense

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:84%
that that which was so
temporary in nature, that they

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:90%
sprout seemingly out of nowhere.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:90%
They're up for a few days.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And they disappear.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So our time window of
experience with mushrooms

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:84%
is very short compared to
animals and plants, you know,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
where our experiential
window of exposure

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.640 align:middle line:84%
goes over for weeks,
months, years.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And so our knowledge
base of those organisms

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:90%
is much larger naturally.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So mushrooms became
like forbidden fruits.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was very much attracted to
the forbidden fruit, you know.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
interesting that mushrooms

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.634 align:middle line:84%
invoke such passionate
feelings about people.

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They do.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: People are very
rarely neutral about mushrooms.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.624 align:middle line:84%
They're either
terrified of them.

00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Or they
just love them.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.123 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or they love them.

00:02:52.123 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And so that's
an interesting dichotomy.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And I like walking the edge
between those two extremes.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.539 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that explains a lot.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Explains why you're
wearing this hat.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You like walking the
edge between the two.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.964 align:middle line:84%
This is an actual mushroom
on your head, isn't it?

00:03:04.964 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Yeah.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
This hat is actually
made from this mushroom,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
which is called amadou.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Now this hat is made by
some ladies in Transylvania.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a tradition
that's been kept alive

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And this mushroom,
if you hollow it out,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.296 align:middle line:84%
this mushroom was
on birch trees,

00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:25.461 align:middle line:90%
on the side of a birch tree.

00:03:25.461 --> 00:03:26.242 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And if you
hollow this mushroom out,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors discovered you
could carry fire for days.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is a fire
starter mushroom

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
that enabled the
portability of fire.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Now is before Bic
lighters, before matches.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How-- in what
forest do you find this?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:90%
In what region.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: It's in the northern
temperate forests throughout

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:90%
the world, so--

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's I thought.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I've walked
through forests

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and seen things like
this on the trees.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.638 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And so you
hollow this mushroom out.

00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And you put coals
of a fire inside.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.107 align:middle line:90%
And you can cap it.

00:03:54.107 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And you could then, you can
carry fire and then rekindle

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's no doubt that we
all came from Africa 140,000

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:90%
the 200,000 years ago.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
We had two migrations,
one successful, one not.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.004 align:middle line:90%
And we went north.

00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered something
new called winter.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.235 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:04:09.235 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
If your clan could not survive,
because you didn't-- your clan

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:84%
would not survive if
you didn't have fire.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So the portability of
fire, this mushroom

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely critical
for human survival.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Now in fact, when you boil
this mushroom in hot water,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.600 align:middle line:90%
it delaminates into this fabric.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's also known,
some of your listeners

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:90%
may know it as German felt.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And it's
a felted product.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And they actually add ashes from
a fire, fireplace, or campfire

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.385 align:middle line:84%
into water, and
making lye water.

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they boil
this mushroom.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It delaminates into
mycelium, which

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
is this fabric is
made of this fungus.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And the fibers inside
is called mycelium.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.779 align:middle line:84%
And so these hats are highly
flammable, by the way.

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Highly flammable.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Do not try this at home.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:90%
But how long does that last?

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:90%
How long will that hat last?

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.863 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Oh, well.

00:05:03.863 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
These hats, depending
on-- they're

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.945 align:middle line:84%
very water absorbent, so
our ancestors smeared them

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:84%
with animal grease to
make them waterproof.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But these hats are
incredibly warm.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
They're a natural
form of insulation.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And so our ancestors
long ago discovered

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:84%
that mycelium in hats is
a great form of insulation

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and would keep you warm.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the hats
will, they will last

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
as long as you take
care of them well.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:90%
But they're somewhat fragile.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now, of
course the mushroom

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
we can and is responsible
for the sustainability

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.529 align:middle line:84%
of our ecostructure,
basically, in our forests.

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to explain that.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I love how passionate
you are about this subject,

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and how you open all
of our eyes to things

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.129 align:middle line:90%
that we might not know.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you could share
with us a little bit,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of great
slides that you've

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
brought with you, which I
appreciate, of how this works.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
How does the mushroom
sustain the forest.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.061 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well,
mushrooms are fungi.

00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
There are one to
two million species

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:84%
of fungi in the
kingdom of fungi.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
About 10% are mushroom
forming fungi.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Penicillium molds are not
mushroom forming fungi,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:90%
they're molds, right.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So 10% of the kingdom of
fungi are a form mushrooms.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
About 140,000 species
are estimated,

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of which we've only
identified 14,000,

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
meaning 90% of the species
out there have not yet

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:90%
been identified.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
foundations of the food web.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:90%
These actually generate soil.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And the consequence
of their activity

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
creates the
biospheres in the soil

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:90%
that we are dependent upon.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So these are the soil
magicians of nature.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Exactly
how does that work?

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.873 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well,
exactly how that works--

00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Exact-- I mean, many
different types of mushrooms

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:90%
that you find in the soil.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.754 align:middle line:90%
Does it aerate the soil?

00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:90%
It provides nutrients.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, they have
an appetite for a decomposing

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:90%
plant and animal material.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So I always like
to mention that you

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
should come at peace with
fungi, because they're

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:90%
going to get you no matter what.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:90%
They are the decomposers.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And we become soil
ultimately, as our ancestors

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:90%
have been, and as nature.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So these are the grand molecular
disassemblers of nature.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
What that means is they'll
take a tree or a plant.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And they'll actually unravel
them on a molecular level.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And doing so, they'll
reduce them to then

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
be nutrients for
many different life

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:90%
cycles of many other organisms.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And this process of
decomposition brings life.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
In Asian culture, mushrooms
are looked upon as rebirth.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And those of us
influenced by the British

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
primarily look upon mushrooms
as fetid decomposers.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a real interesting
yin-yang view of life.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Dichotomy
is interesting.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.103 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: You know.

00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
In Asia, they se these
as rebirthing organisms.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's a
slide that you have here

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.806 align:middle line:84%
that shows that,
that shows really

00:07:49.806 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
how it goes deep into the
soil and causes the trees.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And it spreads way deep
beneath the surface.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.274 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at that
slide of exactly what we're

00:07:58.274 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:90%
looking at here.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Show us.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.211 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, this
is a cross section.

00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's the front
cover of my book.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And what people,
and event scientists

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
do not know this, that
all plants are part fungi.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So they give a host defense of
resistance against diseases.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And so as of today,
just today it

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
was announced,
that they have now

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
surveyed the biota of the
microorganisms that make us,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking to you, Lisa.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But I am a colony
of microorganisms.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:84%
There's 10 trillion
bacterial cells

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.659 align:middle line:90%
to one trillion human cells.

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Now the bacterial cells
tend to be smaller.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.783 align:middle line:90%
And our cells tend to be larger.

00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But we're more
bacterial cells than we

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
are human cells
by number account.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we know that
we are these consortia

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
of microorganisms that
are unified together.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking to
you as a community

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
of microorganisms
with one voice.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But now this is the same
true throughout nature.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Nature's been built upon
community and cooperation.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And these communities
of cooperating organisms

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
synergistically working
together create a mantle of life

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to evolve,
adapt, and explore.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.934 align:middle line:90%
And that is the way of nature.

00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So these microorganisms
exist underneath our forests.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.992 align:middle line:84%
And there's specific
fungi that--

00:09:12.992 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Right.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
There's basically four classes
or groups of mushrooms.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are the parasitic
mushrooms that kill trees.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of
them like wolves

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
going through a pack
of animals and they

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:90%
call off the weaker ones.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, that increases the
strength of the community

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.690 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So parasitic fungi kill
weakening plants and trees

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and other organisms.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
the saprophytic fungi

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that then grow upon
dead organic material.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And so once
something is rendered

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:84%
that's no longer alive, then
the saprophytic fungi surge.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's thousands
of these fungi.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And they decompose it.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And
they decompose it.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And they unlock those
nutrients very, very quickly.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very interesting.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they
help with that, OK.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.076 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And then
the endophytic fungi

00:10:03.076 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is something that's really
come to the forefront,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:84%
especially for agriculture
and understanding

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:84%
how these other fungi
work with within plants.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
They actually infuse parallel
to the cells within plants,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:90%
in the stems and in the leaves.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And so a tree might have 200 to
500 different endophytic fungi

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:90%
species within the trees.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be thought these
little blotches on the leaves

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:90%
were diseases.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, to a large part, most
of those in many cases,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:84%
are endophytic fungi that
keep parasitic fungi away.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.197 align:middle line:84%
So the endohytes to
protect the plants--

00:10:41.197 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Protect the trees.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: From the
parasitic fungi.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's in the
plant's best interest

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to have a really good
civilization of fungi

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:90%
to help keep the predators away.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
endophytic fungi.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.164 align:middle line:84%
And then the
mycorrhizal fungi, I

00:10:57.164 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:84%
think most people
have heard about this,

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
but they extend the
roots zones of plants

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
literally, literally
no exaggeration,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:90%
by thousands of times.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the root tips as
they go into the soil,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
then there's an
explosion of mycelium

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that extends root zones
thousands of fold.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And the mycorrhizal fungi are
not saprophytic typically.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
They can't break down wood.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But they're very, very good
at moving minerals to plants.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And in exchange, the roots
give a burst of sugar

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:90%
to the mycelium.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.825 align:middle line:84%
And then that's their
reward to the mycelium.

00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:31.149 align:middle line:84%
And the mycelium rewards
the plants with minerals.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they transport
the nutrients into the trees.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And this is a
huge, huge, huge issue now.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there's now--
we've heard of peak oil

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:90%
but we have peak phosphorus.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And within 40 years,
the prediction

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
is the fertilizer industry
will collapse around the world.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the biggest
threat to the food chain,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
besides peak oil and
the fertilizers coming

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
from all those oil byproducts,
the phosphorus that's

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
called the
mineralization of rocks,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:90%
this is what these fungi do.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:90%
They actually eat rocks.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Fungi eat rocks, pulling the
minerals out of the rocks

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and giving them to the plants.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So the way of future,
many scientists

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
believe that the
way of the future

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is to reintroduce
the mycorrhizal fungi

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and get rid of the
addiction to fertilizer.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.567 align:middle line:84%
It is like a drug
to a drug addict.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:84%
We need to go back
to natural systems.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is interesting.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
That is what you are here
and responsible for doing,

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.934 align:middle line:90%
is educating us about that.

00:12:20.934 --> 00:12:21.725 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:12:21.725 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: One of many, yes.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.791 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, many things.

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So now the next picture we
have is the actual mycelium.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
This is what it looks like
when it comes out of the earth.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.306 align:middle line:84%
And this is that what that web
looks like underneath the--

00:12:30.306 --> 00:12:31.512 align:middle line:90%
under the forest floor.

00:12:31.512 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Right.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Under my single
footstep, we were

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
walking around the
woods of Colorado,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.255 align:middle line:84%
there can be more than
300 miles of mycelium.

00:12:38.255 --> 00:12:38.921 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: They are
thin, thin threads.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's seen it.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't seen it, just
go outside where there's

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.796 align:middle line:84%
a piece of wood on the
ground and tip it over.

00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
You'll find mycelium,
this white fuzzy stuff.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And gardeners know
it extremely well.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And the mycelium is
virtually everywhere

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:90%
within the ecosystem.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And the soil layer
that we just upon, it's

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
extremely thin, just a
few inches to a few feet.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a very
sensitive biosphere.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And these fungi are the
guardians of the biosphere.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.869 align:middle line:84%
So one of our Facebook
questions that's coming in,

00:13:08.869 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:84%
how do we know if this
is poisonous or not.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be a great
person to answer that.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, how do we know
which plants are poisonous.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
How we know what animals,
like some frogs are edible.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Some frogs are poisonous.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
We build upon our
ancestral knowledge.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, there's been
a lot of experimentation

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:90%
by humans in the past.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And the body
intellective knowledge

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that we have as a culture,
and for many cultures

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
we've now build a compendium
of those mushrooms which

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:84%
we know are edible and
which ones are poisonous.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:84%
There are great
mycological societies

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:90%
of which I'm a member.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a nonprofit national
organization called the North

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.030 align:middle line:84%
American Mycological
Association.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The website is namyco.org,
N-A-M-Y-C-O dot O-R-G.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.159 align:middle line:84%
And there are mycological
societies where people can join

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and learn about which mushrooms
are edible and which ones are

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:90%
poisonous.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:55.884 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:13:55.884 --> 00:13:58.880 align:middle line:84%
You need the app so you could go
around the forest [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
The future, bringing
technology to the forest.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:10%
All right, so the
next picture we have,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:10%
it really shows how
those roots form

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:10%
and how these mycelium and fungi
go through the forest floor

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.851 align:middle line:10%
kind of like in a snake
like pattern, right.

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:10%
>>STAMETS: Well, the image
you're looking at now

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:10%
is as a mycorrhizal fungi.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:10%
And there is a root of a tree.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:10%
The mycelium comes up under
high moisture conditions,

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.170 align:middle line:10%
exhales carbon dioxide, just
like us, inhales oxygen.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:10%
So these are externalized lungs.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.591 align:middle line:10%
>>STAMETS: These are
externalized stomachs.

00:14:30.591 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Of the tree.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:10%
>>STAMETS: Yeah,
coming from the roots.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.390 align:middle line:10%
And so it's very-- you know, the
mycelium responds to moisture.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And what most
people don't realize

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:84%
is most all mushrooms
are photosensitive.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:90%
They require light.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's totally
opposite of what you've

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
been told about the bad
jokes which I won't repeat.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.527 align:middle line:90%
I hate mushroom jokes.

00:14:50.527 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I've heard them all.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.359 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sure you do.

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:53.901 align:middle line:84%
I recognize you're
sensitive to that.

00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:54.734 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going there.

00:14:54.734 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Please.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely not.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:90%
I respect that.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.475 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: But most all
mushrooms respond to light.

00:14:59.475 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a signal response
to tell the mycelium

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:90%
that you're above ground.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And the combination of oxygen
inhalation and light exposure

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.456 align:middle line:84%
with moisture causes the
mycelium, which can be resident

00:15:11.456 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
in the ecosystem for
hundreds of years

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, then to produce
a mushroom overnight,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:90%
then met over a few days.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.171 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what we
see above the soil

00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:21.074 align:middle line:84%
has hundreds of miles of
mycelium underneath the soil.

00:15:21.074 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Yeah.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.948 align:middle line:84%
The common analogy, which
is pushing it a little bit,

00:15:23.948 --> 00:15:26.020 align:middle line:84%
is the roots are to
an apple tree what

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:90%
the mycelium is to a mushroom.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand, yes.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.494 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: So the mushrooms
are the fruit of the mycelium.

00:15:33.494 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is fascinating.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So this picture that we're
looking at here is a slide.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.884 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the
mycelium under a microscope?

00:15:39.884 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Yeah.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a scanning electron
micrograph that I took.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And I studied SEM
work for many years

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and looked at literally
thousands of specimens.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was always amazed at
the network design of mycelium

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:90%
as it is resistant to change.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And the mycelial's
network design,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
if there is a catastrophic
impact and damage or injury,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.510 align:middle line:84%
the mycelium, which is very
different than most organisms.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
It actually benefits
from disturbance.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
mycelium is broken,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:90%
it forks and forms spindles.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:90%
And so it regenerates.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.962 align:middle line:84%
In fact, mushroom growers
long ago discovered

00:16:18.962 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that even in the button
mushroom industry

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
when after they have one
or two crops of mushrooms,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
if they rake the
beds by disturbance,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.707 align:middle line:90%
the mycelium will re-flourish.

00:16:27.707 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Very resilient.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Very res-- it's interesting.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.354 align:middle line:84%
So they've become the
internet kind of the forest.

00:16:34.354 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Yeah, I
proposed in the early 1990s

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:84%
with my wife in our
many discussions

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that the mycelium is
Earth's natural internet.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the invention
of the computer internet

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
is an inevitable consequence
of a previously proven

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary model that we
can see in nature today.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
We were destined to create
the computer internet

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:84%
at a time critical for sharing
information and nutrients,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.445 align:middle line:84%
just as the mycelium does
in nature for over hundreds

00:16:58.445 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:90%
of millions of years.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.445 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As above, so below.

00:17:00.445 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.988 align:middle line:84%
So this next picture
we have is a picture

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:07.560 align:middle line:84%
of the actual mushroom
growing within in the soil?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, the
mycelium is very tenacious

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:90%
when it's grabbing onto wood.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it holds the
substrate, as we call it,

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
together, the wood
particles together.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So the myceliated habitats
are resistant to erosion.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
They're spongy habitats,
so they absorb water.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:90%
They retain water.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's obvious then if you
had a soil and a habitat that

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
retains much more
moisture, that benefits

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
many other organisms that
are moisture-dependent.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So these are really
the leading edge

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:84%
to restoration of ecosystems
by not only providing

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.040 align:middle line:84%
more nutrients, but they set
the stage of a high moisture

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:84%
environment that then
benefits many other organisms.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
coolest things that I

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:84%
like to take-- people are not
familiar with the subject-

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
is I take them into
an old growth forest

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:90%
directly after a rain.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And the scent of the
old growth forest,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that mosaic of
scents, fragrances,

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
a large part of that
is the out gassing

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
from the mycelium
underneath your feet.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
It's this perfume.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Now our olfactory senses are
not as tuned in as bears,

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.555 align:middle line:90%
and dogs, and even many insects.

00:18:15.555 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And so they--

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I bet yours is.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.149 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: But yeah,
actually it is.

00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Because we follow scent trails.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.989 align:middle line:84%
And so there are the
invisible fragrance trails

00:18:23.989 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
that are emanating
through the woods.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I
just the other day,

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:84%
one of our favorite
mushrooms is matsutake.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.897 align:middle line:84%
And the matsutakes don't come up
until October in the Northwest.

00:18:33.897 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And we were walking
through the woods.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And we smelled matsutake.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we memory mapped this
place in the old wood forest

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and said we're coming
back here in October.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that
matsutake's here.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.312 align:middle line:90%
Because we can smell it.

00:18:44.312 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the scent
signatures of mushrooms

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:90%
species tend to be very unique.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.392 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this opens
whole more universe.

00:18:50.392 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Universe.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:90%
We have so much to cover.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.904 align:middle line:84%
So this picture
that we have here

00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:90%
is actually an oyster mushroom.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:90%
This is how prolific they are.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.273 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Oyster
mushrooms are some

00:18:58.273 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
of the most common
mushrooms in the world.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They grow virtually in
every woodland habitat.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.151 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's beautiful, really.

00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And it's one the
you buy at the grocery stores,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.199 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:19:06.199 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a mushroom that has a
natural form of lovastatin.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So it actually reduces
your bad cholesterol.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting studies.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
It has very strong anti
E. coli properties.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.420 align:middle line:84%
But really remarkably,
oyster mushrooms

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:90%
will break down the oil.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:84%
They'll break down
petroleum products.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.458 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very important.

00:19:23.458 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Now, the mycelium
produces these enzymes.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And they excrete them externally
from the mycelium that you saw.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And these little moisture
droplets that has the enzymes

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:90%
break down wood.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And wood is composed of
cellulose and lignin.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And these are held together
with carbon hydrogen bonds.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same enzymes
break the bonds

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:90%
that hold hydrocarbons together.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:90%
And so they break them apart.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And so by a quirk of nature, or
maybe by a design of nature--

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, maybe.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Is that
the oyster mushrooms

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.837 align:middle line:84%
are remarkable in their ability
of breaking down toxic waste.

00:19:56.837 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So this was fascinating.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
When I watched the
Ted talk that you

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
gave that has had over a
million views on the internet,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:84%
when I saw the six ways that
a mushroom can save the world,

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%
this blew my mind.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible work.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So the mushrooms, they actually
can absorb toxic oil spills,

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:84%
nuclear waste, all sorts
of different things.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, in some of
the experiments that we've

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
done, and now fortunately,
this has been repeated now all

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Some successes, some failures.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
But as we get better at this,
we have more and more successes,

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is that we can introduce
oyster mushroom mycelium

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:84%
into toxic waste fields that
have petroleum products.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And they'll absorb
the oil products.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.620 align:middle line:90%
And they'll denatured them.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:90%
And they'll break them down.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Then from an analysis
that we've done,

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
what we believe, the
operating premise here,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
is that we can break
down hydrocarbons

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:90%
into elemental forms.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the fungi
remanufacture them

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:84%
into fungal carbohydrates,
which are sugars.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So we can take
toxic waste, which

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:84%
is extremely toxic to most
all organisms, where habitats

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:90%
are stifled and they're anemic.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we can bring
in oyster mushrooms.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the oyster mushroom
mycelium breaks it down,

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:84%
remanufactures it
into fungal sugars.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Bacterial communities
come into play.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Plant communities come back.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And they become a gateway
into ecological restoration,

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.667 align:middle line:84%
causing a plurality
of other organisms

00:21:22.667 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:90%
to grow grow very, very rapidly.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely incredible.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is a picture here of
exactly how the cell absorbs

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
the mushroom, and
absorb the oil.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Yeah, actually, the
mycelium is white normally.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:90%
But the mycelium will go black.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like a sponge.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.661 align:middle line:84%
And we worked with
Battelle laboratories

00:21:39.661 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:84%
out of Sequim, Washington
for a number of years.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:46.245 align:middle line:84%
And so my co-authors
and comrade researchers,

00:21:46.245 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:84%
we worked on this
for many years.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to do what's
called proof of concepts

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:90%
and do mesocosm experiments.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And now we've done
many experiments

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
outside and in
other environments.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now could you
actually have enough mushrooms

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.790 align:middle line:90%
to consume a massive oil spill?

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean do they replicate
in this environment?

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Or do they decompose
in this environment?

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, that's
a really good question.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the
economies of scale.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So smaller toxic waste
spills are obviously easier

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:90%
to remediate than ones.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But we have a lot of unfortunate
examples in the past few years.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:90%
So we are strategizing.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And I love a challenge.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And and every time there's been
a major oil spill, et cetera,

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I literally get hundreds
and hundreds of emails.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.171 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, some of these
questions are like, hmm,

00:22:32.171 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Let me think about that.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that I've been

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
able to come up with
some innovative solutions

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that I think will lead the
way into future generations.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Now we had the BP
oil spill recently.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But before that, we had
the Cosco Busan oil spill

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:90%
in the San Francisco Bay Harbor.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.045 align:middle line:84%
And prior to that, we
had the Exxon Valdez.

00:22:51.045 --> 00:22:52.937 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These were
massive scale.

00:22:52.937 --> 00:22:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Massive scales.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
believe that oil

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:84%
which is below the skin
of the earth, the soil.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Should just stay there.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:84%
When you bring up
things that are

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.740 align:middle line:84%
below the skin of the
earth, below the soil,

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.942 align:middle line:90%
they tend to be toxic.

00:23:08.942 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And we live on this thin
membrane that gives us life.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And bringing this
stuff up, we have

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:90%
some real needy challenges.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So I've been breaking
down oil spills on land

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
for a number of years
with other researchers

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and other researchers in Europe.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And so after the BP oil spill,
I had literally hundreds

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:84%
of people write me,
what would you do?

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I came up
with myco booms.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is the mycelium
on [? straw ?] are sawdust.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And since they're using booms
to corral the oil anyhow,

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
why not use a floating boom
of mycelium to corral the oil.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It produces enzymes that starts
the disintegration of the oil.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:90%
And you can corral it.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And the booms then do
not have to be picked up,

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.520 align:middle line:90%
because they're biodegradable.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So this, I think, is a better
way than just using a boom,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
is you can corral, absorb,
and decompose, or start

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:90%
the process of decomposition.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Now the scientists
in the audience,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to be very
clear about this,

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
these are called polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
These are long chains
of hydrocarbons.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:84%
The really big,
complex chains are

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:90%
extremely hard to break down.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:84%
The simple ones, there are
two or three hydrocarbons

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:90%
stuck together.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Bacteria can break down.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:84%
What these fungi are
really good at doing

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.670 align:middle line:84%
is taking the really
big hydrocarbons

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.607 align:middle line:84%
in a stepwise fashion, reducing
them into smaller ones.

00:24:27.607 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
The smaller hydrocarbons,
then there's

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
other organisms in
the environment.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Then they can come into play.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So these are
gateway species that

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.092 align:middle line:84%
create a cascading influence
towards bioremediation.

00:24:38.092 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I saw very specific
part of that picture, where

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the mushrooms were actually
extending beyond the band

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:84%
that you had there and
growing outside of it.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So therefore,
that's where you're

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.852 align:middle line:84%
talking about that cascading
effect happening, right.

00:24:50.852 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Right.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
I feel is groundbreaking.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.840 align:middle line:84%
This is something that I see
has massive implications, where

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:84%
it comes to our
survival of our species

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.632 align:middle line:90%
and the survival of this planet.

00:25:06.632 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've created
something that

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.695 align:middle line:84%
has incredible
implications of survival.

00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, I mean we
build upon the knowledge

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:90%
of our ancestors.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm carrying the torch
in this generation perhaps.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.995 align:middle line:84%
But it's soon to be passed
to the next generation.

00:25:19.995 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have a gateway
to many restoration strategies

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:84%
using fungi as the first
step in this process that

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:84%
enables a lot of other methods
to be able to work even better.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about for nuclear
and toxic effects like that?

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, that's
an excellent example.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And from these catastrophes,
we have teaching lessons,

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:90%
not ones that we wanted.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, right.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Harsh lessons.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.783 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: But they occur.

00:25:43.783 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to figure
out what we can do.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But after Chernobyl,
a group of researchers

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
at Einstein University
looked at remote cameras

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.360 align:middle line:90%
going into Chernobyl.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, a million rads
of radioactivity.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the containment
vessel of Chernobyl,

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:84%
they found black molds
growing all over the walls.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And these molds worry subjected
to high radioactivity.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered something
unknown previously to science,

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that fungi that produce melanin,
like we have in our skin,

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.530 align:middle line:84%
use radiation in a form
similar to the way plants

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:90%
use light to photosynthesize.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Now this, we have a new way of
metabolism that these fungi.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Now this could have
huge implications

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
for the interplanetary
colonization of space.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.325 align:middle line:84%
We can grow fungal foods using
the radioactive gamma particles

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
that are coming
from the engines.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.376 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot total greenhouses
through the vacuum of space.

00:26:38.376 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I want
you to hold right there,

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:90%
because that's an amazing point.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I want you to spend
some time on that point.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a quick
break and come right back

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and understand how these
mushrooms can really

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.855 align:middle line:84%
support our entire
ecological system, as well

00:26:51.855 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:90%
as our immune system.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.175 align:middle line:84%
We'll find out when we come
back with Paul Stamets.

00:26:56.175 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:90%

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:14.356 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.356 --> 00:27:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Welcome back.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.010 align:middle line:90%
My guest is Paul Stamets.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:90%
He is a mycologist.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
these incredible mycelium

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.682 align:middle line:84%
and how they can actually
absorb toxic waste.

00:27:23.682 --> 00:27:25.890 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about that
a little before the break.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
If you can continue on that
thought, what did you call it?

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Colonization of space?

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, because
of my TED connections,

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:90%
I was invited to Googleplex.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And at [? sifu ?] camp
would have been 140 thinkers

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:84%
together, Nobel
laureates, et cetera.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:10%
I had the pleasure of meeting
the commander of the Mars

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:10%
Mission Project.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:10%
Six months to get the Mars,
one year on the planet,

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.760 align:middle line:10%
six months to get back.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:10%
I asked, what's the biggest
concern that you have?

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:51.926 align:middle line:10%
And they said, by far,
feeding the astronauts.

00:27:51.926 --> 00:27:53.250 align:middle line:10%
How do we carry that much food?

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:53.749 align:middle line:10%
We can't.

00:27:53.749 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:10%
We have to grow it.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:55.610 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, how are
you going to grow it?

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.735 align:middle line:10%
They said, well, we think
about towing greenhouses.

00:27:57.735 --> 00:27:59.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm In the vacuum of space?

00:27:59.050 --> 00:27:59.939 align:middle line:10%
Greenhouses?

00:27:59.939 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:10%
How are you going to heat
them, all these things.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what this discovery
from this accident at Chernobyl

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
has shown us is that these
fungi can be grown on minerals

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and using radioactivity
as a fuel source,

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:84%
like plants use light
for photosynthesis,

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
we can generate sugars
from fungi eating rocks

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and end up growing
tempe-like foods.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
get to Mars, then we

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.700 align:middle line:84%
could begin mycoterra
forming We could

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.290 align:middle line:84%
begin to terraform the planet
using these fungi that we bring

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to start using the
minerals and breaking down

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:84%
to feed the plants,
like we talked about

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:90%
for the mycorrhizal fungi.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we can then support
the plant communities

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
without having to bring
over fertilizer, et cetera.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So this really is a
huge potential avenue

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that historically may be looked
upon in the future, looking

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.070 align:middle line:84%
back, as one of the
nexus points of discovery

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that could enable the
colonization of other planets

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.657 align:middle line:84%
by humans, from the
accident at Chernobyl.

00:29:00.657 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.284 align:middle line:84%
I can see how you
have completely

00:29:03.284 --> 00:29:04.842 align:middle line:84%
fallen in love with
these creatures.

00:29:04.842 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:84%

00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
absolutely beautiful display
of these fantastic fungi.

00:29:20.505 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Mushroom
mycelium represents

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.005 align:middle line:84%
rebirth, rejuvenation,
regeneration.

00:29:25.005 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:90%


00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Fungi generates soils
that gives life.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.610 align:middle line:84%
The task that we face
today is to understand

00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:90%
the language of nature.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:10%
My mission is to discover
the language of nature

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:10%
of the fungal networks that
communicate with the ecosystem.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And I believe nature
is intelligent.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:05.780 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we lack the
language skills to communicate

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
with nature does not
impugn the concept

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:90%
that nature's intelligent.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.333 align:middle line:84%
It speaks to our inadequacy
for communication.

00:30:15.333 --> 00:30:18.036 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.036 --> 00:30:20.652 align:middle line:84%
If we don't get our act
together and come in commonality

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.110 align:middle line:84%
in understanding
with the organisms

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.474 align:middle line:84%
that sustain us today,
not only will we

00:30:24.474 --> 00:30:26.765 align:middle line:84%
destroy those organisms, but
we will destroy ourselves.

00:30:26.765 --> 00:30:35.220 align:middle line:90%


00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a paradigm
shift in our consciousness.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:84%
What will it take
to achieve that?

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.560 align:middle line:84%
If I die trying, but I'm
inadequate to the task

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
to make a course change
in the evolution of life

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:90%
on this planet, OK.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:90%
I tried.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.760 align:middle line:90%
The fact is, I tried.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.686 align:middle line:90%
How many people are not trying?

00:30:52.686 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:84%
If you knew that
every breath you

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:84%
took could save hundreds
of lives into the future

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.597 align:middle line:84%
had you walked down
this path knowledge,

00:30:59.597 --> 00:31:01.430 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you run down
that path of knowledge

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:90%
as fast as you could?

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe nature
is a force of good.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Good is not only a
concept, it is a spirit.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.857 align:middle line:84%
And so hopefully, the spirit
of goodness will survive.

They are absolutely
beautiful creatures.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about how
the mycelium could actually

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.090 align:middle line:90%
absorb nuclear waste.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So how could this help
something like Fukushima?

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, Fukishima,
again after thees disasters,

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I seem to be the
receiver of hundreds

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:90%
of emails on what you do?

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
complicated situation.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Now my father was a nuclear
engineer, a nuclear scientist.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And we argued about
a lot of things.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I protested against
nuclear power plants.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.470 align:middle line:84%
But my dad, you
know, said one thing

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:47.630 align:middle line:90%
that haunts me to this day.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:90%
He's now passed.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.510 align:middle line:10%
And he said, no
matter what, you don't

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.126 align:middle line:10%
want to keep nuclear waste
adjacent to an operating

00:31:53.126 --> 00:31:54.500 align:middle line:10%
nuclear power
plant, should there

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:10%
be a runaway nuclear reaction.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.835 align:middle line:84%
The waste fuel, then
could fuel that reaction.

00:31:58.835 --> 00:31:59.680 align:middle line:90%
I went oh, my gosh.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:90%
I agree with my dad totally.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But in no nuclear
manual did they ever

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.040 align:middle line:84%
consider the combination
of an earthquake

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:90%
with a tsunami with a meltdown.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that
that does occur.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It will occur into the future.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So after Chernobyl,
there was this mushroom

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
that hyper-accumulated
cesium-137

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:90%
from radioactive fallout.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Ukrainian scientists
went out in the forest,

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.074 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the Ukrainians
were all wild food gatherers.

00:32:26.074 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were
concerned about them

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:90%
getting radiation exposure.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So they analyzed on the downwind
environment from Chernobyl

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.820 align:middle line:84%
what foods were safe to eat
and which ones were not.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:84%
They found something
really bizarre.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:84%
One mushroom
hyper-accumulated cesium-137

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.890 align:middle line:84%
more than 10,000 times
the background levels.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Now a mush-- a mycelium.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:84%
but up channel, the
radioactive metal from fallout

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:84%
moved by the mycelium,
and the mushroom

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.120 align:middle line:90%
became highly radioactive.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Now why would this do this?

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:10%
Now I philosophically
look at this

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:10%
as the skill sets
of this species

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:10%
and the biodiversity
of fungi in the forest

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.670 align:middle line:10%
called microdiversity.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:10%
Every species has
certain sets of skills

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:10%
that can help repair
the environment

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:10%
to guarantee the plurality of
the organisms that give rise

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:10%
to the trees, that create debris
fields that feed the fungi.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:10%
So these have a long view.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:10%
And that complexity
of the biosphere

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:10%
is extremely important.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.191 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: When we
lose biodiversity,

00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:24.860 align:middle line:84%
we lose a lot of species that
have talents that we didn't

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.710 align:middle line:84%
even know that we need until
a disaster like this occurs.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So around Fukushima, when
I proposed a nuclear forest

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.290 align:middle line:84%
exclusion zone, we make it
into an old growth forest,

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:84%
or the Japanese would,
for hundreds of years.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you would then selectively
go in under hazmat conditions.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And you would pull out
the radioactive mushrooms.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mushrooms, right.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.785 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And you would
then in a stepwise fashion

00:33:44.785 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:84%
reduce the amount
of radioactivity

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:47.602 align:middle line:90%
over the long term.

00:33:47.602 --> 00:33:49.060 align:middle line:84%
This is not going
to take a decade.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to 100 years.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
hundreds of years.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.314 align:middle line:84%
And in the course
of that, you'll

00:33:53.314 --> 00:33:54.960 align:middle line:84%
have an old growth
forest grow up.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what you do with
the radioactive mushrooms?

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Then would
incinerate them.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.430 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to complain
about burning mushrooms.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can recapture
the radioactive metals,

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:84%
which they do already with
scrubbers and incineration.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:84%
They can recapture
the metals now,

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.760 align:middle line:84%
because they've
been concentrated

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.681 align:middle line:90%
into the mushrooms.

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:84%
The big issue is, how do you
get it out of the environment?

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right, right.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:90%
You

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Can't scoop up
30 square miles of soil.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going to put it?

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:90%
You can't dump it in the ocean.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:84%
You actually can't
incinerate it.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And so by having these
hyper-accumulators,

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:28.350 align:middle line:84%
detoxify the surrounding
environment, hyper-toxifies

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:30.030 align:middle line:84%
a mushroom, which
then it allows it

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.300 align:middle line:84%
to be portable to pull it
out of the environment.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to--
I think this should

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:35.716 align:middle line:90%
be taught within schools.

00:34:35.716 --> 00:34:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have to
become part of the body

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
intellect of the Japanese
educational system, where

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.880 align:middle line:84%
generations of people realize
that this old growth forest is

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
a testimonial to human
ignorance and not

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.300 align:middle line:84%
anticipating that you have an
earthquake and tsunami that

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:90%
created a nuclear meltdown.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.705 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have more
Fukushimas in the future.

00:34:54.705 --> 00:34:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Bear witness to that.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it's going happen.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So you actually hold
a solution there,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.300 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people--
and I'm so glad that you

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.430 align:middle line:84%
talk about this and
that your message

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is getting communicated
to so many people.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Because this is vital.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So now, we reduce this
entire conversation

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:90%
down to pest control.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Not that its' a bad thing,
but you can actually

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.640 align:middle line:84%
use the mushroom
to control pests

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:84%
in-- this is something
else that you've

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.920 align:middle line:84%
turned this entire industry
on its head, the pest control

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.440 align:middle line:84%
industry, by creating
a new patent of how

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:84%
these mushrooms could actually
control unwanted pests that

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.440 align:middle line:90%
destroy structures in your home.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: I'm so
grateful to be the bearer

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.600 align:middle line:84%
of this knowledge
and this discovery.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But let me give credit to
hundreds of other mycologists

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:84%
who spent all their
lifetime working on this.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered something
different, that-- and this

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.060 align:middle line:90%
is not my specialty.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But I now have received
five patents and soon two

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:90%
more that are revolutionary.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.510 align:middle line:84%
The US Patent Office
gave me these patents

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that are useful
against all insects

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.502 align:middle line:90%
without restriction to species.

00:35:55.502 --> 00:35:57.918 align:middle line:84%
This is something called the
Alexander Graham Bell patent.

00:35:57.918 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It is so vast in
its implication.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Now to bring
this into context,

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:84%
everyone's seen
ants walking around.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly
cleaning themselves,

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
is because the soil
is full of what

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.640 align:middle line:90%
these fungi that kill them.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.250 align:middle line:84%
They're called
entomopathogenic fungi-- entomo

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.110 align:middle line:90%
meaning insect, pathogenic.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And so these
entomopathogenic fungi

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.964 align:middle line:84%
are constantly trying to
grab hold of the insects

00:36:19.964 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:90%
and infect them.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So the insects are constantly
cleaning themselves.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a deadly dance
between dinner and death,

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:84%
as they migrate around
the environment.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered a way of taking
these fungi, and I morph them.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I shut down sporulation, so
they're no longer infectious.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.584 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a Trojan horse.

00:36:39.584 --> 00:36:41.250 align:middle line:10%
And then the insects,
rather than trying

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:10%
to clean themselves,
they want to eat it.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:10%
And they carry around.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.346 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: They consume it, OK.

00:36:46.346 --> 00:36:50.290 align:middle line:10%
>>STAMETS: And virtually every
ant nest, every termite nest,

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:10%
in the world has these
fungi growing naturally.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:58.650 align:middle line:10%
So it's not amplifying
foreign species.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.500 align:middle line:10%
These fungi are literally
underneath every footstep.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's called endogenous
Metarhizium, is the genus.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally
the most common,

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
some of the most common,
fungi in the world in soils.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I have these
now patents which

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:90%
I have not commercialized them.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I've met with the EPA.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But this could be totally
displace the pesticide industry

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and petrochemical dependence
of the industry in a way that

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:84%
uses a nature based solution,
which I've just advanced sort

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution of nature
a great step forward.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm using natural--

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By [INAUDIBLE] the
pesticides, and the chemicals,

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and the harshness
of-- yeah. [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.161 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: I'm able to
do to tweak the life

00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:42.640 align:middle line:90%
cycle in the laboratory.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So I got a temporary window
that would not occur in nature.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'm able to extend
the mycelial state

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.580 align:middle line:84%
without the reproductive
state of the spores.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.029 align:middle line:84%
And the spores turn out to
be repellent to the insects.

00:37:54.029 --> 00:37:54.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not stupid.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
They can smell the plague
when they get near it.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:57.605 align:middle line:84%
Just like you open
up your refrigerator

00:37:57.605 --> 00:37:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and you smell moldy, mold,
in your refrigerator.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.980 align:middle line:90%
You're repelled by it.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the insects re
hypersensitive to the spores.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered that if
you suppress sporulation,

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.790 align:middle line:84%
then the opposite
effects happen,

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.367 align:middle line:84%
is the insects
want to consume it.

00:38:11.367 --> 00:38:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so when they
consume it, what happens?

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.824 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, this is where
a subject of great debate.

00:38:15.824 --> 00:38:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We've had tremendous results
against mosquitoes, against bed

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:24.340 align:middle line:84%
bugs, against termites,
against fire ants.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.899 align:middle line:84%
This is why I proved it
about 12 different species.

00:38:26.899 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:90%
And the patent office says, OK.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Now you've made it obvious.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And if there's one sentence
in Hungarian, and Chinese,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.404 align:middle line:84%
and Japanese that stated this
in the scientific literature

00:38:36.404 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
or elsewhere, I would not
have gotten these patents.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So the patent office was
very reluctant to give me

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.020 align:middle line:90%
these patents.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.294 align:middle line:84%
Because now they gave
me basically all insects

00:38:45.294 --> 00:38:46.585 align:middle line:90%
without restriction to species.

00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:47.585 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:38:47.585 --> 00:38:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: The good news
is these don't kill bees.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:52.797 align:middle line:84%
But they kill the mites, the
Varroa mites, that kill bees.

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That kill the bees, yes.

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.588 align:middle line:10%
>>STAMETS: And so now they're
doing experiments and putting

00:38:56.588 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:10%
these fungi with bees,
beehives, to limit the mites

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.757 align:middle line:10%
and the devastating
effect they have on those.

00:39:03.757 --> 00:39:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So then the [INAUDIBLE], this
of course, consumes their body.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And we have a picture of this.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.014 align:middle line:90%
And it takes over the actual--

00:39:11.014 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Yeah.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's called
a dimorphic fungus.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's got two faces,
like of the same coin.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.300 align:middle line:84%
It's got a mold state, like
a little fuzzy mycelium,

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and then it's got
a mushroom state,

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and boing, a
mushroom will pop out

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.830 align:middle line:84%
of their head in many,
many of these species.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's called Cordyceps.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Cordyceps is and
immunosuppressant mushroom.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And so
these mushrooms,

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these species, produce
a Cordyceps mushroom fruit

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:37.247 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:39:37.247 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.210 align:middle line:90%
So that's how that happens.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.555 align:middle line:84%
So basically, there
are-- a listener

00:39:41.555 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:84%
who's asking these very,
very good questions.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Can mushrooms
possibly go extinct?

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.655 align:middle line:84%
And you have
something that you've

00:39:47.655 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:84%
created that
enables people to be

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.570 align:middle line:84%
able to grow mushrooms
in their home.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.399 align:middle line:90%
Kids can do this.

00:39:52.399 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And they can basically
take this and put it

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.648 align:middle line:84%
into the forest
behind their house.

00:39:55.648 --> 00:39:59.329 align:middle line:84%
And they can continue to
propagate the species.

00:39:59.329 --> 00:40:00.412 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Well, yeah, I--

00:40:00.412 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We have that right here.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well,
this is-- again,

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I've been a kid scientist ever
since I was born, it seems.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.250 align:middle line:90%
This took forever to produce.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:90%
But this is my LifeBox.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And inside the
corrugations of the box,

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.430 align:middle line:84%
inside these little flutes,
are about 200 to 300 seeds

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:90%
of trees with mycorrhizal fungi.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So we're going full circle
here to the beginning

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:84%
of this interview, with
the beneficial fungi

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.090 align:middle line:90%
in association with the seeds.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we wrote every
department of agriculture

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.920 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
to get approval.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And so these are
non-invasive trees.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.510 align:middle line:90%
They may not be native.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And people go well, if
they're not native, well,

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:39.176 align:middle line:90%
that's not good.

00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, no garden vegetable
in your garden is native.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So they'll grow anyway.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.789 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, so they'll grow.

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
But through natural selection,
like in the drier environments,

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.060 align:middle line:84%
we have dry land cotton
woods and dry land pines.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll survive in
a dry land environment.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And then in New England
and the Northwest,

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.950 align:middle line:84%
we have Douglas
firs and hemlocks

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that will grow better
in that environment.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So first we want to be able
to produce the LifeBox, which

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:90%
can regenerate forests.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's no extra
weight in the box.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:84%
UPS, FedEx, the post
office, they already

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:84%
have a delivery system
to the consumer.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And so my idea is to reinvent
the packaging industry

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.360 align:middle line:90%
with LifeBoxes.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:90%
This is our forest LifeBox.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a vegetable
LifeBox also in production.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you basically, every
box, then you tear it up.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:25.910 align:middle line:90%
And you plan it.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And a little forest
of trees comes up.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
two years to put

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.630 align:middle line:84%
these trees outside
on some land.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And then by GPS coordinates,
when you plant the trees,

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:41.450 align:middle line:84%
you can then, with Google
Earth or other mapping systems,

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.700 align:middle line:84%
designate where you planted
the trees with your GPS

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:90%
coordinates.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.132 align:middle line:84%
You create the
family tree program.

00:41:46.132 --> 00:41:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And you designate these
trees as part of your family,

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.740 align:middle line:84%
so it could be a
[? LEESIS ?] family tree.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And as these trees
ascend and become larger,

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:55.430 align:middle line:84%
then future generations
knew that you

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:56.780 align:middle line:90%
cared about climate change.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you
can have a picnic

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.227 align:middle line:84%
under a tree in the future
that came from a LifeBox.

00:42:02.227 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that answers your
question, Roger from Facebook.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Because this is an
absolutely incredible thing.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.616 align:middle line:90%
So anyone can do this.

00:42:07.616 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:90%
You take this.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:90%
It decomposes.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.070 align:middle line:90%
You add water to it.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.324 align:middle line:90%
It grows mushrooms.

00:42:11.324 --> 00:42:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you just put
them into wherever

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.489 align:middle line:90%
your closest region is.

00:42:14.489 --> 00:42:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Yeah, there
are truffle like mushrooms

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.300 align:middle line:90%
are associated inside these.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can elaborate
this in many ways.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I can add chanterelle
spores, or matsutake

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.130 align:middle line:90%
spores, or shaggy mane spores.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we can make
these as a form

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.690 align:middle line:84%
of ecological or
mycological footprints

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that we can then establish
our favorite edible mushrooms

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.220 align:middle line:84%
within the forests that
come from LifeBoxes.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That way you're hunting
mushrooms in the wild,

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.126 align:middle line:84%
why not just put your
wild collected mushrooms

00:42:40.126 --> 00:42:40.770 align:middle line:90%
inside the box.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And the spores then
will go in the box.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.180 align:middle line:90%
And then you plant this outside.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the mushroom
spores will then

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.980 align:middle line:84%
associate with the
roots of the trees.

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.646 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
plant those trees out,

00:42:49.646 --> 00:42:52.580 align:middle line:84%
you've created a medicinal
or gourmet mushroom forest

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
using a LifeBox.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely amazing.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: So you
can customize it.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So now then they grow into
something that's huge.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And you have an
example here that you

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:84%
brought with you of what
these mushrooms look like when

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.391 align:middle line:84%
they get to be
absolutely massive.

00:43:05.391 --> 00:43:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Now this isn't going
to necessarily happen

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.950 align:middle line:90%
from a LifeBox.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But show us what
you brought here.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.826 align:middle line:84%
This is a little show and
tell segment for everybody

00:43:11.826 --> 00:43:12.780 align:middle line:90%
to take a look at.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: This is my--

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Look at
the size of that.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: My finest
fungal friend,

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:19.720 align:middle line:84%
if I could honor
it with that name.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.720 align:middle line:84%
This is an extremely
rare mushroom

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.027 align:middle line:84%
called a [? gericon. ?]
And now it is now

00:43:24.027 --> 00:43:25.360 align:middle line:90%
thought to be extinct in Europe.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It only grows in the old growth
forest of Washington state,

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.990 align:middle line:84%
or Oregon, Northern California,
and British Colombia.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:35.977 align:middle line:84%
And this mushroom is the longest
living mushroom in the world.

00:43:35.977 --> 00:43:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not this particular
one, but this species.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.268 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Yeah, this one
is about 40 years of a age.

00:43:40.268 --> 00:43:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And this mushroom grows at the
top of old Douglas fir trees

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and spruce trees
exposed to the wind,

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.980 align:middle line:84%
exposed to the ice storms,
and severe weather, oftentimes

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:90%
exposed to the sun.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Yet it does not rot for
more than 100 years.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at
this mushroom long ago

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and wondering what is it about
this mushroom that gives it

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:84%
the ability to defend
itself against pathogens.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we could learn
something from that.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.584 align:middle line:84%
So I made a my lifelong quest,
one out of 40 or 50 times going

00:44:08.584 --> 00:44:10.750 align:middle line:84%
into the old growth forest,
and I'm skilled at this,

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:12.270 align:middle line:90%
will I find one of these.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I have now 44
strains in culture.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.820 align:middle line:84%
We have the largest
culture library

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.260 align:middle line:84%
of this [? garicon ?]
mushroom in the world.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And my intuition proved out
to be very good on this,

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.897 align:middle line:84%
because we found that
within this mushroom--

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I became involved with
the BioShield program

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
with the US Defense
Department after 9/11.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And I submitted
over 600 samples.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, it turns
out our most powerful samples,

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.140 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful samples
the BioShield program ever

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.020 align:middle line:84%
saw of any of their samples
against pox viruses,

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.640 align:middle line:84%
including smallpox,
and flu viruses

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.450 align:middle line:84%
came from our cultures
of this mushroom.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding?

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:90%
They have antiviral properties?

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Antiviral,
antibacterial properties.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And to find something that's
dually active against viruses

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.209 align:middle line:90%
and bacteria--

00:44:57.209 --> 00:44:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely, yeah.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Is medically unique.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, we found out that
there is a deep treasure

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:06.400 align:middle line:84%
trove of new molecules
unknown to science.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And we've identified now a
group of compounds highly active

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:90%
against bird flu.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.250 align:middle line:90%
And the bad news, folks.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:16.760 align:middle line:84%
We live in our houses in
our short little lifetime.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is we
are experiencing

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.780 align:middle line:84%
a massive extinction event
right now all around us.

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And as environments
are polluted,

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.050 align:middle line:84%
as there is overcrowding
from factory farms of pigs

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and other animals and chickens,
as human populations increase,

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.260 align:middle line:84%
as water quality declines,
and habitat health declines,

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.700 align:middle line:84%
the rule of nature
is you have disease.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And so [INAUDIBLE]
diseases are going

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.620 align:middle line:90%
to be springing out of nature.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And most scientists now
who study the subject

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:84%
are now predicting that
we'll have viral storms, just

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.570 align:middle line:90%
like we have weather storms.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.480 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
have viral storms.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.570 align:middle line:90%
And whether it's a--

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We see incidences
of this with the flu

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.036 align:middle line:90%
epidemics that we see.

00:45:53.036 --> 00:45:56.657 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The flu H1N1 came
out of a pig farm in Mexico.

00:45:56.657 --> 00:45:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.371 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: I was
interviewed several times.

00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And myself and other researchers
said, this is going to happen.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:03.450 align:middle line:90%
And it did happen.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.408 align:middle line:84%
Now, we missed the bullet
because it turned out

00:46:05.408 --> 00:46:09.160 align:middle line:84%
to be highly contagious, but not
very pathogenic comparatively.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.490 align:middle line:84%
We now, it doesn't matter
whether it's a bioterrorist

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:84%
or it comes from nature, because
now the mathematical models

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.800 align:middle line:84%
have shown that
it's probable now.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so
many opportunities

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.295 align:middle line:84%
of the remixing of
these flu viruses

00:46:24.295 --> 00:46:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that are in birds,
pigs, and humans.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:28.492 align:middle line:90%
And we co-mingle.

00:46:28.492 --> 00:46:30.825 align:middle line:84%
I was really concerned after
Fukushima with the tsunami,

00:46:30.825 --> 00:46:32.130 align:middle line:90%
you had dead bodies.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:36.130 align:middle line:84%
You had people, pigs, and birds
all in this big liquid soup.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So the viruses--

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And the viruses
could evolve out of it.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.308 align:middle line:90%
They may still indeed evolve.

00:46:40.308 --> 00:46:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Still happen.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: So
finding these fungi

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and then I posed to the
US Defense Department

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:84%
that therefore, we should
save the old growth

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.715 align:middle line:84%
forests as a matter
of national defense.

00:46:48.715 --> 00:46:49.548 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my gosh.

00:46:49.548 --> 00:46:51.735 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And I was really
happy with the response.

00:46:51.735 --> 00:46:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.301 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: They were
100% behind that.

00:46:54.301 --> 00:46:55.800 align:middle line:84%
This is what Americans
need to know,

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.380 align:middle line:84%
is the US Defense Department
does not care that

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.670 align:middle line:90%
much about politics.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the upper
management does.

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:04.080 align:middle line:84%
But the people that are involved
in the US Defense Department

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.300 align:middle line:84%
are concerned about protection
of human health and animal

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:07.890 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And since viruses
know no borders,

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:12.600 align:middle line:84%
they're concerned about the
protection of global health.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So the global health
initiatives now, a lot of them,

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the key officials in the
US Defense department,

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:21.640 align:middle line:84%
are looking about and looking
at environmental integrity.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.430 align:middle line:84%
If you keep the
environment healthy,

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.000 align:middle line:84%
you keep the food chains
healthy, you feed people,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:90%
you don't have poverty.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't have disease.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:28.790 align:middle line:90%
You don't have terrorism.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.390 align:middle line:84%
They're all consequential
of a decimated ecosystem.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So the happier the
ecosystem is, we're

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.657 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of
that environment,

00:47:35.657 --> 00:47:37.490 align:middle line:84%
the happier societies
generally going to be,

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:84%
because they have ample
resources for food and health.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So protecting
these old growth

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.900 align:middle line:84%
forests are a matter
of national defense.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:43.280 align:middle line:90%
That's a very strong statement.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: I absolutely
believe this.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.429 align:middle line:84%
And I can make the argument,
I think, with anyone.

00:47:47.429 --> 00:47:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Believe it or not,
I have conservative friends.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.451 align:middle line:84%
And they've told me
well, we couldn't

00:47:51.451 --> 00:47:54.230 align:middle line:84%
get behind the spotted owl,
but we can get behind this one.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:55.030 align:middle line:90%
I go, OK.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I agree.

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So now these actually contain
the antiviral and antibacterial

00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.980 align:middle line:90%
properties.

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you take these in
terms of a supplement form

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:05.087 align:middle line:90%
for immune system support?

00:48:05.087 --> 00:48:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you take them as a
preventative measure?

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.586 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Yeah.

00:48:07.586 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the areas I'm
segue waying into

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:11.710 align:middle line:90%
is insects carry diseases.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.455 align:middle line:84%
Like mosquitoes carry
West Nile virus, right.

00:48:14.455 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So they're called
zoonotic diseases.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.815 align:middle line:84%
Animals that carry diseases
to humans or to other animals,

00:48:19.815 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:90%
are called zoonotic diseases.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, we found
that this mushroom

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:28.330 align:middle line:84%
has very strong
anti-herpes effects.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's an incurable.

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, and herpes,
it falls into a category called

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:36.340 align:middle line:84%
oncoviruses, viruses
that can cause cancer.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Now we know about hep
C causing liver cancer.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We know about HPC
causing cervical cancer.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So the viral to cancer
bridge is quite strong,

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and increasingly strong.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Over 20%, around
20% of all cancers

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:55.900 align:middle line:84%
have a viral component,
or a precursor

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.667 align:middle line:90%
that precipitates that cancer.

00:48:57.667 --> 00:48:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:59.708 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Nature's
a numbers game.

00:48:59.708 --> 00:49:00.810 align:middle line:90%
And so, yes.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:04.894 align:middle line:84%
These mushrooms--
unfortunately, many ways

00:49:04.894 --> 00:49:06.560 align:middle line:84%
are considered grass,
generally regarded

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.640 align:middle line:84%
as safe, because of the
2,000 year history of use.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.910 align:middle line:84%
This mushroom was first
reported by Dioscorides

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:16.910 align:middle line:84%
in 65 AD, 2,000 years, ago, as
a treatment against consumption,

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:19.990 align:middle line:84%
which later was thought to
be known as tuberculosis.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So this mushroom has
antibacterial properties,

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.640 align:middle line:84%
tuberculosis is a bacterium,
and antiviral properties.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So this bolsters your
host defensive resistance

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:32.730 align:middle line:90%
to be able to resist disease.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And so this mushroom
is very important,

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I think, in reducing
oncoviruses and another viruses.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.250 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So we have some
pictures of these in the forest.

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:43.624 align:middle line:10%
This is Dusty, your wife,
holding one of them from one

00:49:43.624 --> 00:49:44.290 align:middle line:10%
of the branches.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.640 align:middle line:84%
This is you holding
this very mushroom here,

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.220 align:middle line:90%
which is phenomenal.

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk a little bit
about the mushrooms that

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.950 align:middle line:90%
are the turkey tail mushrooms.

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.710 align:middle line:90%
And we have a picture of these.

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're quite
vibrant in color.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about those.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well, the
turkey tail mushrooms

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.180 align:middle line:84%
are the old name,
the scientific name,

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:90%
was called coriolus versicolor.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And they are multi-colored.

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And the new name is
trametes versicolor.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese knew it as yun zhi.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.742 align:middle line:84%
And versicolor because it's
variable in color, good name.

00:50:15.742 --> 00:50:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It's nice when you
have a Latin name that

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.610 align:middle line:90%
make sense, versicolor.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's been well known
in Asia and reported

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:23.520 align:middle line:90%
to help the immune system.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.522 align:middle line:84%
And so about five years
ago, we were funded,

00:50:26.522 --> 00:50:28.480 align:middle line:84%
our group was funded, by
the National Institute

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.970 align:middle line:84%
of Health for a $2.2 million
breast cancer clinical study.

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.180 align:middle line:84%
The clinical study has
just been published,

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and using turkey tail mushroom
mycelium as an adjunct therapy

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to conventional therapy to help
the immune system of breast

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.500 align:middle line:90%
cancer patients recover.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It shows a very
positive response.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
a nutraceutical ,

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.510 align:middle line:84%
this can be bought at the
local health food stores,

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that can empower
the immune system.

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:52.717 align:middle line:84%
Because doctors are
very good at surgery.

00:50:52.717 --> 00:50:53.800 align:middle line:90%
We have radiation therapy.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.560 align:middle line:90%
We have chemo.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But they have nothing for
the immune system, and so--

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.123 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:50:57.123 --> 00:50:58.230 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely essential.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:00.021 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: And so the
turkey tail mushrooms

00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:02.220 align:middle line:84%
help rebound the immune
system on a stepwise basis,

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.590 align:middle line:90%
on a dose dependent basis.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:06.630 align:middle line:84%
You're taking two pills, four
pills, eight pills per day.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You can see a direct
measurement of the increase

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.415 align:middle line:84%
in immune response, not
only by the numbers,

00:51:11.415 --> 00:51:13.332 align:middle line:84%
and so any doctors
listen to this,

00:51:13.332 --> 00:51:15.290 align:middle line:84%
they're natural killer
cells, not only is there

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.510 align:middle line:84%
more natural killer cells,
but the killer cells

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:22.620 align:middle line:84%
become educated, overcoming
immune evasion of the tumors,

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.450 align:middle line:84%
which can evade
the immune system

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and then the
natural killer cells

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.139 align:middle line:84%
achieve immune invasion, where
they can invade the tumor

00:51:31.139 --> 00:51:33.430 align:middle line:84%
cells, and like little
Pac-mans, they break them apart.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very important.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: So this is
the operating hypothesis

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:36.670 align:middle line:90%
that's been seen now.

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.894 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a
personal story about this.

00:51:38.894 --> 00:51:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I want the listeners to watch
this personal story of yours.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.607 align:middle line:84%
Take a look from one
of your TED Talks here.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: In June, 2009, when
my 84-year-old mother called me

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.300 align:middle line:90%
up and says, Paul.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I have something very
serious to talk to you about.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.090 align:middle line:90%
But you're always so busy.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a terrible thing
to hear from Mom.

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, Mom, what's wrong?

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And she's a very
happy, genuine person.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, I'm worried.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And my mother's deeply
religious and has not

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.800 align:middle line:90%
seen a doctor since 1968.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.760 align:middle line:84%
She said, my right breast is
five times the size of my left.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I have six swollen lymph
glands the size of walnuts.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And her voice start shaking.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not ashamed to
admit that I started crying.

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:26.290 align:middle line:84%
We spent a large part of June
at the Swedish Breast Cancer

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Clinic in Seattle.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.370 align:middle line:84%
The oncologist examined her
and upon second examination,

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:36.040 align:middle line:84%
she had a 5.5 centimeter
diameter tumor.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.020 align:middle line:90%
It metastasized.

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:90%
It went to her sternum.

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:39.810 align:middle line:90%
It went to her liver.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:42.560 align:middle line:84%
She had stage four
breast cancer.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The doctor gave her less
than three months to live

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and stated it was the second
worst case of breast cancer

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.350 align:middle line:84%
she has seen as a doctor
in 20 years of practice.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We had the circle
family meeting.

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have
gone through this.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.850 align:middle line:84%
My mom announced that she bought
a pine casket, the cheapest

00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:02.860 align:middle line:84%
one that she could find,
because she was going to heaven.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:04.460 align:middle line:84%
But then the doctor
said, you know.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.370 align:middle line:84%
You're too old to have
radiation therapy.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:08.355 align:middle line:84%
You can't have your
breasts removed.

00:53:08.355 --> 00:53:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But there's an interesting
study on turkey tail mushrooms

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.320 align:middle line:90%
at [? Bastyr ?] Medical School.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.880 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
try taking those.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- my mother goes,
well my son's supplying those.

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:22.175 align:middle line:84%
So she was put on Taxol and
Herceptin, wonderful drugs.

00:53:22.175 --> 00:53:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And then she started
taking eight turkey tail

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.010 align:middle line:84%
capsules a day,
four in the morning

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.960 align:middle line:90%
and four in the evening.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And that was in June, 2009.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And today, my mother has
no detectable tumors.

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:39.124 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like to thank my mother.

00:53:39.124 --> 00:53:41.604 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:41.604 --> 00:54:15.332 align:middle line:90%


00:54:15.332 --> 00:54:16.350 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely,
absolutely amazing.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:19.920 align:middle line:90%
You did an amazing thing there.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STAMETS: Thanks.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:22.378 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Paul, you did
an incredible thing

00:54:22.378 --> 00:54:25.440 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, and
for many people.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.340 align:middle line:84%
When I saw that, I started
emailing my friends who I do

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.310 align:middle line:84%
know that are struggling
with cancer right now

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and telling them about this.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And so why is this not
more readily available,

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.710 align:middle line:90%
more widely known?

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: Well it's
becoming more widely known.

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Most physicians are clueless,
because they have not

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:41.339 align:middle line:90%
heard of the research.

00:54:41.339 --> 00:54:42.380 align:middle line:90%
They have not studied it.

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:44.296 align:middle line:84%
There's an article that
came out in The Lancet

00:54:44.296 --> 00:54:47.850 align:middle line:84%
in 1994 with gastric
kind of cancer.

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And it showed an increase
in life span in combination

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.460 align:middle line:90%
with chemotherapy.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:57.490 align:middle line:84%
No one's recommending these in
place of conventional therapy.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:55:00.177 align:middle line:84%
These are adjunct,
to help to tilt--

00:55:00.177 --> 00:55:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Boost the immune system.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: The balance in
favor of immune recovery.

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of doctors
are looking at this now.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:10.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a-- this study was just
published in "The International

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Journal of Oncology"
in this past week.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And so now the phase one
study has been published.

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:19.641 align:middle line:90%
And now we're on to phase two.

00:55:19.641 --> 00:55:20.765 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely amazing.

00:55:20.765 --> 00:55:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STAMETS: So I think lots
of people could benefit from

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:25.570 align:middle line:84%
eating mushrooms
as a preventive,

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:27.680 align:middle line:90%
as well as subsequently, so--

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:29.750 align:middle line:84%
You've done an
incredible job today

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:33.650 align:middle line:84%
to show us how these incredible
mycelium and the fungi

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:36.940 align:middle line:84%
could clean up oil spills,
can boost immune system,

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.120 align:middle line:84%
can save us from
natural disasters,

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and our old growth forests be
a matter of national defense.

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:47.240 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely amazing.

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad that you're
here to share this with us.

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:51.290 align:middle line:90%
