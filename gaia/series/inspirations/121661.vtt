00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaia Inspirations."

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:10%
and our topic for this series
at the Celebrate Your Life

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.980 align:middle line:10%
Conference in
Phoenix, Arizona is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.550 align:middle line:10%
exploring the "I am" meaning.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is
Colette Baron-Reid,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and she's known for her
laser-sharp intuitive insights.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:84%
She's so beautifully confident
in what she talks about

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:90%
because it's truth.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:84%
She was voted into
the Watkins List

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.294 align:middle line:84%
as one of the top 100 most
spiritually influential people

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and she's also the host
of her own show called

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:90%
"Messages from Spirit."

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.531 align:middle line:90%
>>COLETTE BARON-REID: Hello.

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:46.692 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sister from
another mister.

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And I would like
to say that I was only voted

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:90%
twice into the Watkins List.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:90%
I didn't make last year's.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.253 align:middle line:84%
I'm no longer a spiritually
influential person, apparently.

00:00:56.253 --> 00:00:57.687 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
beautiful thing

00:00:57.687 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:90%
is that it doesn't matter.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.395 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: It
really doesn't matter.

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh well, I was there.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I was not there.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't make you
any less spiritual.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.825 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: But that
doesn't mean anything either.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:10.343 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You told me before
that you teach the I am.

00:01:10.343 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: I do.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From what perspective?

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: For me, the I
am is not a statement as much

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
as it is an energy
that you embody.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So when we are ego-based,
we are in a different type.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:90%
We are in the Me am.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:90%
If you know what I mean.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Me, me.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.162 align:middle line:10%
And so when we're engaged
in the small self,

00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:10%
the small self is contracted.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:10%
It has a sensory
periphery, very small.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:10%
And it only sees the
conditions of the world that's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:10%
in front of it and sees
itself reflected in that.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.093 align:middle line:84%
So we're afraid when we're
in the me-am, if you will.

00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That's what you get
so overloaded in that space.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And it's
also because that part

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
of the self which is still
unique and makes us unique--

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
we need the ego self in order
to define ourselves as unique.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But it also limits
us in such a way

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
where we are no longer
connected to a higher sense

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness, if you will.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So when we work with
the I am presence,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
we even sit up straighter
when we say I am.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So there is no I
am this or that.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So when I am tuned
into I am, I'm

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:84%
not afraid I'm not attached
to what's in front of me.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:90%
I can be curious.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:90%
I say, that's interesting.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a state of observation.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So the I am presence has
no attachment to what it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
sees in front of it
and doesn't identify

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:90%
with what's in front of us.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe
that we have been

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:90%
born into spiritual amnesia.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I think we all know who we
are when we're little kids

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:90%
and we're babies.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have this extraordinary
sense of the world.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.799 align:middle line:84%
And you have a child,
or a couple kids?

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So when they were little
kids, aren't they,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
like, ET has been
born in my house.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.475 align:middle line:90%
It's like, who are you?

00:03:02.475 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
they're so interesting.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: You can see me.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it's this ancient being
inside this little tiny skin

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:90%
pod.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: We all say our
children are our greatest

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:10%
teachers for that reason.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:90%
They see right through you.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Especially
when they're babies.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:10%
Because they don't know that
they are that divine I am.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:90%
They know they are the I am.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they are a
function of I am.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, we are all
functions of I am.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:10%
If we are able to
move ourself aside,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:10%
the small self
aside, long enough

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:10%
throughout the day to
tune into that space

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:10%
of extraordinary, infinite
possibility and co-creation,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:10%
because that's where we get our
best ideas isn't from the me.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.495 align:middle line:90%
It's from the I am.

00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
called inspiration.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:90%
It's of the spirit.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And art-- I'm a
recording artist as well,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
so when I've written
music and when

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I've done that part of
my work in my world,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm channeling
something that isn't me.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:10%
Like, my new Oracle card deck,
the Wisdom of the Oracle-- I

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:10%
don't even know who wrote that.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.946 align:middle line:10%
After I finished it and I handed
it in, I'm going, who was that?

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Because they've
very divine messages.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:10%
>>BARON-REID: Oh no, it's
my most accurate deck,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.555 align:middle line:10%
because I was literally
stewarding it in.

00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.302 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the I
am, we're stewards.

00:04:14.302 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:90%
We're stewards.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:90%
We're stewards of everything.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:90%
We're co-creationists.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We're part of the
creative dynamic.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't about us.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:90%
It's about us.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It does.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:90%
It has a certain energy to it.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So what you wrote on these
cards and how they came through

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.755 align:middle line:90%
is definitely very profound.

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: This speaks
to the I am, by the way.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
All my Oracles-- Oracles
are conversation tools,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:90%
but they're languages.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
They're the language
that-- and each deck

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever created all come
from ancient oracle systems

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:90%
that I've modernized.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:10%
So they have a template
that I work off of.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And then they talk to me.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's so interesting.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.947 align:middle line:10%
This one actually came
out of a space of I

00:05:02.947 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:10%
am to speak to the I am.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:10%
A matter of fact, my next
deck, The Good Tarot,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.887 align:middle line:10%
actually is all in the
first person, I am.

00:05:10.887 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't have it yet.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:90%
I just finished it.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.696 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I love your website,
because it's interactive.

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
You can pull cards on
your site for free.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:10%
>>BARON-REID: But we would
like you to purchase them also.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.565 align:middle line:10%
Straight to camera.

00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So speaking
of your work,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
you also wrote a great
book called "The Map."

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And you say in this
book that you already

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:90%
know your future, essentially.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:90%
We already know our destiny.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this,
because when I

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:84%
had this experience, this
near-death experience that I

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
had, I went into this
other dimension that pulled

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:90%
the future back to now for me.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to express.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:90%
And then I didn't--

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.598 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: I get it.

00:05:55.598 --> 00:05:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know you do.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't even realize
it til 15 years later

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:90%
that that was what I saw.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.615 align:middle line:84%
It was an incredible
experience, very incredible.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.246 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: You said an
awful lot in two sentences.

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:09.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's go there now.

00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:10%
So the book "The Map"-- I own a
school called The Envision Lab.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:10%
And I train coaches and
therapists and people

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:10%
on how to use-- I'll just
say people in general--

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:10%
but how to use a process called
the Envision Process, which

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:10%
is a trademarked
energy psychology

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.600 align:middle line:10%
process that I developed after
and from this book "The Map."

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So "The Map" is
really about learning

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
a manner in which you don't
identify with the subconscious.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:84%
You instead identify
with possibility.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the subconscious
is a program, a condition,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
that is repeated
over and over again.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And it contains a
very contracted view

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:90%
of what's possible.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So this book asks you to see
yourself in the now, always

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:90%
in the now.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
The future is now.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:90%
The crystal ball is now.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not about some time in
linear time down the road.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Your potential and what you are
going to create for the future

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:84%
is right here and now,
present inside of you.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So as a matter of
fact, everything

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.831 align:middle line:84%
you see in the conditions
of our life right

00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.292 align:middle line:84%
now is a result
of past thinking.

00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we
see in the world right

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
now was set by a mind
that put that in motion.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Not today.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Intention--

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: It was set.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So we are seeing the
external world right now.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Many people see that as our now.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, that's
our past's future.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So the future you
from five years ago

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:84%
created what is
happening to you now.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:90%
You get that?

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:10%
So when we want to make
changes and we feel uncertain,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:10%
we have a tendency to look
at what's in front of us

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:10%
as the indicator
of where we are.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is our now.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
But now this isn't
This was our then.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.639 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Five years ago.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.438 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:07:56.438 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: That's the future.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to create
something different,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
we have to acknowledge
that this exists,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:84%
but we have to own a
different state of being.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:90%
And we have to reinforce that.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we do that
over time and then

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.701 align:middle line:90%
that becomes our reality.

00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
That becomes our
future because that

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is-- so the more we identify
with the now consistently

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.109 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, that's why
we say history repeats itself.

00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't make the
change, if you do what you did,

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.425 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
get what you got.

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:25.396 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
definition of insanity

00:08:25.396 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
by doing the same thing over
and over again and expecting

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:90%
different results.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So
what you talked about

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.893 align:middle line:84%
is a little different than
what the book's really about.

00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, this helps
people detach enough

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to get into an observant state
so that they aren't attached

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.159 align:middle line:84%
to the conditions of the reality
that they've been programmed

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.169 align:middle line:90%
to see as their truth.

00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:90%
They could see beyond it.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.709 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
book teaches people,

00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that the map is something
that shows up for you as you

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.942 align:middle line:90%
experience your now.

00:08:54.942 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you create
your future that way.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how
you know your future.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: That's correct.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So if I am creating
something new,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going into a place
that's unknown, as we all

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.582 align:middle line:84%
do, when we set goals,
when we try to create

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:84%
a different path for ourselves,
when we try to do something

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
different, to create
a different result,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
the brain automatically
goes into freeze mode.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.896 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Well that's
actually the subconscious.

00:09:20.896 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And so my research is-- and
the Envision process actually

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
was based on Jungian active
imagination, brain science,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:90%
and shamanic tools.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's got a little
bit of Jung and Jung.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these
little components

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and a kind of derivative
of voice dialogue.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So you're in the
space where you are--

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
so I want to bring this back to
what we used to what you said

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.920 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's-- it takes
so long to explain this,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:90%
so what part of the brain.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.794 align:middle line:84%
So when we are in
stress, so when

00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
we're in stress,
what happens is we're

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
operating in a part of the mind,
of the brain that shuts down

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:90%
everything else.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.222 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at the-- you'll
be interviewing Joe Dispenza,

00:10:04.222 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, and he's going to
tell you the right words.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I'm having
a menopausal moment.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So the reticular activating
system of the brain

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
is the one that's going
to use your eyes to see

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
in the world external to
you the thing that confirms

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:90%
your stress or your fear.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I feel stress and fear.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Then the mind goes, right.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's go in that
Rolodex of experiences.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's go find the same thing.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:10%
Let's go say see-- look
over there, stressful.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:90%
See, you're right.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:90%
It's all bad.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So the brain, which is
all based on chemicals--

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.811 align:middle line:84%
so you've got the neuropeptides
that are chitter-chatter with

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.310 align:middle line:84%
the -- I forget
what they're called.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Serotonin.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So totally not
present at all in this moment.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wait, wait let
me ask you a question.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you something.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.326 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ask you something.

00:10:53.326 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:90%
You're an intuitive, right?

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Of course.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you picking up
some other energy and messages

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Well,
actually, because it

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:84%
feels like we're kind of moving
around in a subject or a topic,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I think we should sort
of get to the point.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.099 align:middle line:84%
Because you're sort
of round the bend

00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:84%
asking me a question
about something,

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:90%
because you say, what if.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:84%
You're starting
something new et cetera.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But your brain is in freeze
mode, and what's going on.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we just say,
you are going into something

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
new right now that you
are looking to develop.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, because there's a
whole other interview happening

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:90%
here and then there's this one.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Why don't we
put them together and not

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
let the viewers wonder, what
the heck are they talking about?

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.544 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's fine, because
I felt a whole other subtext

00:11:40.544 --> 00:11:41.835 align:middle line:90%
to this conversation happening.

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:44.762 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Right,
well, you are subliminally

00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:90%
asking me the question.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:90%
So why don't we just go there?

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.568 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
happens when you're

00:11:48.568 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:84%
creating a brand new project
and you're afraid of it?

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Let's go there.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's not care about how
the brain works or whatever.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Just say you're scared.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
You're contracted,
because fear will not

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
allow the I am to be
operating in your favor.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's when you
would go to an oracle.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And the oracle would be able to
reflect to you what you cannot

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.820 align:middle line:84%
see, because when you are in
a contracted, stressful state,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
you are not able to access your
intuition because you're cut

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So fear, which is false
evidence appearing

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:90%
real, or F everything and run--

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that phrase.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.805 align:middle line:90%
I heard Wayne say that one.

00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I'm a
pirate's daughter.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, so you know
what I'm saying.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do
is to see what is true.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Is there reason to fear,
or what are you afraid of?

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Or where is this going?

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.592 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't see your
own truth when you're afraid.

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.050 align:middle line:10%
Because that whole reticular
activating system in the brain

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.591 align:middle line:10%
that we talked about
earlier is going

00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:10%
to make your little
eyeballs go and find

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:10%
the confirmation that the thing
that you really want and desire

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.962 align:middle line:10%
to do is going to fall apart.

00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Or it's not going to
go in the direction.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's what fear is.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:90%
It's the unknown.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.376 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Let's
go beyond your fear.

00:12:56.376 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, so I'm going to--

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Let's
play with the cards.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's play
with the cards.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Because that's
really what she wants to do.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I'm
asking the question

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
of when I'm creating
something new--

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:90%
and you can all play along here.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Yes, this is
for everyone at home also.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Who's
creating anything new.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Are you
creating anything new?

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:90%
If so, continue to watch.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.869 align:middle line:90%
If not, continue to watch.

00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can tell
she does her own show.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.243 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Something
really amazing

00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen regardless.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:90%
I want you to pick three cards.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And here's how you
have to pick them.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Don't pick it yet.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just be
very clear and just say

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, we're going
to say, that's interesting.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can go wrong.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.075 align:middle line:84%
It's just a reflection of
what could be possible.

00:13:39.075 --> 00:13:41.075 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
unattached to the outcome.

00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so I
do ask a question?

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Yes.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
what can you tell me

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:51.474 align:middle line:84%
about what's going on with this
project, with this new thing.

00:13:51.474 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With anything?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.398 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell what's going on?

00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.225 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Now, when we
look at an oracle, for example,

00:13:58.225 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and we find out
what's going on, I

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
don't personally create
oracles that talk

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:90%
about anything superficial.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're not interested
in the external stuff

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.569 align:middle line:90%
that anybody could see.

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
It's what's going on in
the layers and the deeper

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
layers of the experience--
of your experience,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
because that's how we create
reality is not in the obvious.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.155 align:middle line:84%
It's in the things that we
can't see, through the things.

00:14:18.155 --> 00:14:18.955 align:middle line:90%
Menopause.

00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:22.106 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So here is my three.

00:14:22.106 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Yes, so you've got
chop wood from this new deck.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And you got message in a bottle.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:90%
That's very funny.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And you've got soul mates.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you to
choose another card right

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.995 align:middle line:90%
now from anywhere.

00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and tick-tock is in
the protection position.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:90%
So can we go through this?

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:90%
So we have tick-tock.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I can always send you the
files et cetera-- soulmates.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:90%
What is beyond that?

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Nothing, is there?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:90%
These cards are nice and thick.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So would you like to
know what this says?

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course you would, because
that's why I'm really here.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
So check it out.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:90%
So chop wood is the doing.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people spend a lot
of time as armchair astronauts.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And you sit at
home and you dream,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and you never do anything
to make this happen.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:84%
In your case, the biggest
thing that you have done

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:90%
is done something.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
You've actually taken
the steps and taken

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
the actions, which is
scary, because it's

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:90%
much easier to dream.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's fantastic to be able
to sit in your chair at home

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and fantasize about this
extraordinary thing.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
But now you've put
yourself on the line.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So you've been chopping
wood and carrying water.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
is doing the work.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: You've
done the work.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.131 align:middle line:90%
And you've done the work.

00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And the scariest thing is that
this time, it's also about you.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Is this correct?

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Is this more about you?

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:90%
It's much more personal.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Up till now, you've been
a lot more impersonal.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
You've been the person who
brings other people forward.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:84%
You've been able to
hide behind that.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.809 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go deep here.

00:15:53.809 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to reveal
you right here.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:90%
You sure you want me to do this?

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Because it's really beautiful.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
It's about you and being
empowered and knowing that you

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.451 align:middle line:90%
have a voice that counts too.

00:16:02.451 --> 00:16:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm feeling that, yes.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So you're
putting yourself out there.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
It's scary, because not
everybody is going to want it.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is
going to like it.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like it's you
that's on the line now.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that you've
believed in for so long,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:90%
and now you're the one.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Is this making any sense?

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.586 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
I just talked about.

00:16:19.586 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfectly.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:84%
You're such a giver of
information and so beautiful.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.155 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:16:25.155 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID:
Message in a bottle

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
is what I'm doing
for you right now,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:90%
although I am not in a bottle.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:84%
But this represents
the signs and symbols

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and signals that you keep
getting right when you need it.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:84%
This is about synchronicity,
but it's also about you hearing.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.092 align:middle line:90%
But you being heard too.

00:16:42.092 --> 00:16:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand this?

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:90%
You have a message.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.566 align:middle line:84%
And before, you were
bringing in all the bottles

00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:84%
that everybody else had
and collecting going,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:90%
look how pretty this is.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:90%
So and so's here.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:90%
I can talk about them.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it great?

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.955 align:middle line:90%
Now it's yours.

00:16:53.955 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, there's a whole
theme here, isn't there?

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Check
this out, soulmates.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:84%
This is about
continually creating

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
harmonious partnerships,
that just when you need it,

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:90%
the right people show up.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Even when it's not perfect,
it's really perfect for you.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is about you receiving
the help and support and aid

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
that because you have done that
for so many selflessly and out

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:84%
of a great sense of
curiosity that you've had.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing I
think is so important.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:90%
That's what the I am is.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:90%
It's curious.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't judge at all.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:90%
That's where the I am comes in.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:90%
I am curious.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:84%
If I were to have a statement
for me, I am curious.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.975 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: I'm curious.

00:17:37.975 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and
that drives you.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:90%
It drives me too.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: That's
what drives you, right?

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the fun part.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.365 align:middle line:84%
I knew we had to find
something to talk

00:17:44.365 --> 00:17:46.894 align:middle line:84%
about that was not 100%
which you wanted us to know.

00:17:46.894 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's
so interesting.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:84%
You get a reading, you're
wondering, gosh, what's wrong.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Am I doing this--

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.755 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Nothing's wrong.

00:17:51.755 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There is nothing wrong.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.708 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: There's
nothing ever wrong.

00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's always about
what do we need to see

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:90%
revealed that will help us.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea of having an
oracle speak to you and having

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
what you cannot see translated
in such a way that makes it

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
palatable for you and supportive
for you is that the information

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:90%
needs to be useful.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:10%
It's not useful if you're
telling somebody that

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.634 align:middle line:10%
so and so doesn't like you.

00:18:18.634 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:84%
That's just like a
bunch of gobbledygook,

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
because you and I talked
about that earlier,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.535 align:middle line:84%
like when psychics
come up to you

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:90%
How did it come from?

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you I
was born like this.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.034 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
first memory that I

00:22:48.034 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
have about it, which I wrote
about in my first book, which

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
is not on the table called
"Remembering the Future"

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
was when I started having
nightmares about a skeletal man

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:84%
being burnt and crying at a
table with a mound of teeth

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:90%
and a mound of metal.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.924 align:middle line:84%
And fast forward to
my 20s when I actually

00:23:06.924 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
found out that my
mother was a Holocaust

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.631 align:middle line:84%
survivor and my grandfather
was killed in Dachau.

00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was common practice
for the SS officers

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.740 align:middle line:84%
after they gassed the people,
to pull out all their teeth

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and take the metal and
turn it into jewelry.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather, who
was from Paris-- but I

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:90%
didn't know anything of that.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:90%
I was born in Canada.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have TV.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And my parents never told us any
of this until I was in my 20s.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But I dreamt about that, and
my mother didn't pick me up.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to touch me
when I had that nightmare,

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:36.940 align:middle line:90%
so I would cry.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a recurring nightmare.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that
at that time there

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
was something wrong
with having this.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:90%
So I'll just fast forward again.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So I had a big
violent experience

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:90%
which turned into an NDE.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was like an NDE.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I can say that it wasn't--
I didn't almost die,

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:90%
but I left my body.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:90%
I had a psychotic break.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And this violence was happening
to me by a number of people.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And I left my body and I
hung in the corner of the--

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
like the ceiling.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So it was like I was looking
down from the ceiling

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and I knew all this information
that was later corroborated

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:84%
for me by the people that
knew these guys about stuff

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:84%
about their past, things
that how one of them

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:84%
had been the victim
of systematic abuse

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and locked in a closet by his
father and all this stuff.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was very-- anyway, so
that all was like do-do-do-do.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to say that
I was perfectly,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:84%
spiritually sound after that
experience, but I wasn't.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Tried to kill myself a
couple times in my 20s.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Whee!

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.458 align:middle line:84%
And then I got
clean and sober when

00:24:42.458 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I was 27, which is
almost 30 years ago.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual
awakening came after that.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:10%
And then the actual

wasn't because I was a psycho.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%

when we are unsure

or when we are actually
attached to dogma

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.961 align:middle line:84%
and we don't question
it, it's like a lie.

It makes you feel high,
if anyone's taken drugs.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:90%
It's OK if you have not.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.827 align:middle line:90%
You feel that I'm not present.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: No, exactly.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And it does feel like
when people first

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
try to escape through
a substance, where

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:84%

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:90%

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.767 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And some

00:26:12.767 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Like, some days, I
feel like, oh, God.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:84%
What if this goes away and
I can't do this anymore?

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I have no clue
what's going to come,

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:84%
what's going to be there,
what's not going to be there

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:90%
when I work with people.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm much more confident because
the pictures and the symbols

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:10%
and the energy from
the oracle cards

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:10%
will open up a
doorway very quickly

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:10%
and I'm able to zero in
on something very quickly.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But for example,
my television show,

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:84%
where I'm a medium on
that show, so I'm strictly

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
talking to dead
people only and trying

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:84%
to describe the relationship
between the people

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.956 align:middle line:84%
and the process of
healing that has

00:26:45.956 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:84%
to happen for them
after the fact

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:90%
that they've received a message.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
biggest part of that.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.546 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
biggest part that I

00:26:51.546 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:84%
see when you do that
type of communication

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:84%
is that you unlock
years of pain.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And you resolve and
you create closure

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:84%
when people hear those messages,
because they know they're true.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And they are the only ones
that know they're true.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you say something that
creates that kind of closure,

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.805 align:middle line:84%
it moves and creates
freedom in their life.

00:27:11.805 --> 00:27:12.605 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:27:12.605 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Well, I'm not
a traditional medium, either.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.302 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of get a lot of
flak from the real traditional

00:27:18.302 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:84%
mediums, because
it's just supposed

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.093 align:middle line:84%
to be talk to a dead person,
say hi from the other side.

00:27:22.093 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And you've got that,
et cetera, goodbye.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I
believe the purpose

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
of why I do it is
very different.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.952 align:middle line:90%
And it's about the now.

00:27:30.952 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have
this information,

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:90%
what do you do now?

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't so much either,
oh, they're OK over there.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything is fine.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%

How are you going to
change that story?

victim of that story,

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.480 align:middle line:84%

really happen.

So that's how I direct
my work as a medium.

Then I take it the

So am I confident all the time?

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

by the way, what

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.954 align:middle line:90%
does the upside down card mean?

00:28:35.954 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: It
means protection.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So I created my
oracle card decks

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
to have a system where
when the card is reversed,

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.984 align:middle line:90%
it's not a boogie man.

00:28:45.984 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people say, oh, my God.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to read
the cards upside down.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a negative.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:90%
This is not negative.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:90%
It's about extra protection.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So when I channeled these cards,
that's what the cards wanted.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:84%

There's an extra

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that
instead of predicting

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that something bad is going
to happen, it's saying,

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:90%

works differently.

on what the consciousness
needs, what the greater

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look here at
Colette Baron-Reid read.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:84%
-And what an interesting
week for all of us upcoming.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So the energies for
this week are all

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.551 align:middle line:84%
about negotiating after chaos,
remaining flexible, trusting

00:30:50.551 --> 00:30:52.300 align:middle line:84%
that if something
didn't work in the past,

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to work for you now,

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that you are
heading truly into your highest

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.480 align:middle line:90%
version of prosperity for you.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.660 align:middle line:90%
So here's what the cards are.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:90%
You've got flexible.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know that's a theme
for the entire year of 2016.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And flexible is
about flexibility.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.856 align:middle line:84%
And I'm warning you
not to be rigid.

00:31:09.856 --> 00:31:12.230 align:middle line:84%
If you did something a certain
way and you're used to it,

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.630 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe that's a
way you have to change.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to get invited
into a new way of doing things

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:17.700 align:middle line:90%
this week.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And you are required
to be flexible.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, when chaos and conflict
is in protection position,

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:90%
it says seize the day.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:90%
This moment is valuable.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It is time to restore
order and to also not

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:84%
to be afraid to
jump into the mix,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.900 align:middle line:84%
because you have
valuable, valuable ideas.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time to
negotiate on your behalf.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's good.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Unfinished symphony also reminds
us that when things are--

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:84%
you don't have total closure
about stuff from the past.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.190 align:middle line:10%
It's up this week
to take a look at.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So remember, if you
do what you did,

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.690 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
get what you got.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So do the things that work,
and definitely do not do

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.680 align:middle line:90%
the things that did not work.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.550 align:middle line:10%
And you can say goodbye
to old patterns,

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:10%
because the end result
of all of these things

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:10%
is all that glitters up right
now, in this case, all that

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.870 align:middle line:10%
glitters is going to be gold.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.505 align:middle line:10%
So the implication
of the card is all

00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:10%
that glitters is
not always gold.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:90%
But this week, it is.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really saying,
the more authentic you're

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.769 align:middle line:84%
willing to be, the more you
that you've taken the risk

00:32:14.769 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:84%
to become, the more out of the
box that you've been thinking,

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.540 align:middle line:84%
the more that you've
become flexible and not

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
rigid about the way
you want to do things,

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:84%
the better the universe is
going to get you and get

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.497 align:middle line:84%
with the program for
you and provide you

00:32:27.497 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:84%
with circumstances
and conditions that

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:84%
are perfect for your new growth
and new revelation of the self

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that you want to bring
out into the world.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And remember, you're looking
to sing that perfect note

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:84%
in the harmony of life, and
you're getting real close.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Take care, everybody.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for listening.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:90%
See you next week.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, so you
talked about an exercise,

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:90%
the detachment from anxiety.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is a way to
live without stress,

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.430 align:middle line:84%
but it's a moment
to moment exercise.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us an
example of what that is

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.334 align:middle line:84%
and how if we're in that
state of stress and anxiety,

00:33:01.334 --> 00:33:03.250 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with it
moment to moment, Colette?

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: OK.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a rudimentary
piece of my envision process.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And I write about this
in the book "The Map"

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and in my new book
called "Uncharted."

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:10%
So you ask a
question, where am I.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And you might know
that you feel stressed.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:84%
When I feel stressed,
I feel overwhelmed.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.471 align:middle line:84%
My friend gets stressed,
she feels angry.

00:33:28.471 --> 00:33:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you feel
scared, I don't know.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the stress
shows up as--

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Overwhelmed is mine.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So we have
the same thing-- sisters.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.002 align:middle line:84%
And then I feel it in very
specific areas of my body.

00:33:39.002 --> 00:33:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You know when somebody
says to you, well,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:90%
don't feel like that.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:90%
How's that working for you?

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:90%
That does not work.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.807 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Don't tell
me how to feel.

00:33:45.807 --> 00:33:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: They say,
don't feel that way.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:84%
You have no reason
to feel that way.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:84%
That does not work, and likely
that's people's reactions to us

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.570 align:middle line:90%
when that happens.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So what we do instead of
listening to anyone else

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.142 align:middle line:84%
or asking for help
is ask, where am I?

00:33:58.142 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that you take
a look at your state of mind

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:05.500 align:middle line:84%
as a place you
temporarily inhabit.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So immediately by
asking, where am I?

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.320 align:middle line:84%
You become an observer
of an environment.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So what comes up
to you right away?

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.124 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where am I?

00:34:13.124 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah, when
I feel stress, where am I?

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.727 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm watching orcs
being made too fast--

00:34:19.727 --> 00:34:20.810 align:middle line:90%
"Lord of the Rings" thing.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:90%
I can see that right now.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:26.394 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm looking over a cliff
and there's too many orcs

00:34:26.394 --> 00:34:27.194 align:middle line:90%
being made.

00:34:27.194 --> 00:34:28.624 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm under a rock.

00:34:28.624 --> 00:34:30.179 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID:
You're under a rock?

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So how's that feel there?

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Pressure.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Yeah, and I
don't like it there either.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's true that you're no
longer feeling those feelings.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.265 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
a place, right?

00:34:39.265 --> 00:34:41.889 align:middle line:84%
If I could give you a way out of
that place, would you take it?

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:42.154 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:42.154 --> 00:34:43.154 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: All right.

00:34:43.154 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So I would like you to call
a winged creature to you

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:84%
and whatever shows
up is 100% correct.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Imagine it, boom,
whatever it is.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got her.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.038 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Imagine
that you're sitting

00:34:54.038 --> 00:34:56.571 align:middle line:90%
on it or her or his back.

00:34:56.571 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to go high, high
in the sky until all you see

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.140 align:middle line:90%
is blue.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.437 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:02.437 --> 00:35:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Let me
know when you're there.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:05.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice, yes.

00:35:05.975 --> 00:35:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: How different
does your body feel?

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:09.627 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So much lighter.

00:35:09.627 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:90%
My shoulders just dropped.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: I want you to look
over the side of this creature

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and tell me how big or small
the first place is now.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The rock?

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:18.776 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Sure.

00:35:18.776 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it even from there?

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.760 align:middle line:90%
There's a bunch of clouds.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Right.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:23.060 align:middle line:90%
So can it affect you?

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: No, so right?

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I got it.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.776 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So here
you are right now.

00:35:28.776 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And you would make a
very different decision

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:84%
from this position than you
would from the first position.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.302 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Even you
just completely changed.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So fast.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: It's very fast,
and here is why it works.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.352 align:middle line:90%
Situation's not changed.

00:35:43.352 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:90%
You haven't changed anything.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't fight
anything in my process.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.920 align:middle line:84%
We allow everything to
exist in its integrity.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.010 align:middle line:84%
A terrible situation can
exist exactly as it is.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We just make a choice
to go somewhere new.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Because a state of mind
is a state of mind.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And we travel through a
series of states of mind

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:90%
all throughout our day.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So when we get stuck
in one, we have

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to find a way how just
to detach and observe it.

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as we are in the
observer, we are in the I am.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:84%
We aren't identifying
with the feeling.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.340 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Chemicals get released.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Serotonin, endorphins, right?

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.826 align:middle line:84%
So you got the
feel-good dopamine.

00:36:22.826 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I feel pretty good now.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.640 align:middle line:84%
What the heck-- what
was I worried about?

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Dopamine.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Right, and
that's how fast it works.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why the bird works

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:84%
or the creature
with wings works is

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:37.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's the only, only
thing your subconscious won't

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.890 align:middle line:90%
try to thwart.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you know why?

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.366 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In your imagination.

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:43.145 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: No, what else?

00:36:43.145 --> 00:36:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can't control it?

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: No, because
it's the only creature

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.450 align:middle line:90%
we can't mimic.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.385 align:middle line:90%
We can't fly.

00:36:49.385 --> 00:36:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, true.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.420 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.836 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: So
the subconscious,

00:36:52.836 --> 00:36:58.922 align:middle line:84%
the primitive mind, always saw
beings that flew as magical.

00:36:58.922 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh!

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: It will never
say no to a bird or a dragon

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:90%
or anything that flies.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.790 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious will
go, check it out, wow.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And the unconscious
can sneak in there,

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.740 align:middle line:84%
because the soul itself
doesn't speak English, German,

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:90%
French, Hungarian.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.540 align:middle line:90%
It speaks pictures.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.920 align:middle line:90%
So you engage.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.469 align:middle line:84%
You just jump over the
pattern, the condition.

00:37:20.469 --> 00:37:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And you enter into-- which
is the Jungian piece-- which

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.040 align:middle line:90%
is the active imagination.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's contained,
however, because you've just

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:84%
basically told it,
you're only allowed

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.050 align:middle line:84%
to show me pictures
of places and birds.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I had a beautiful image
of this gorgeous, winged fairy

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:37.600 align:middle line:84%
that was kind of the
color of your hair,

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.554 align:middle line:84%
just a burgundy, very
strong supportive goddess.

00:37:40.554 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: Interesting
you picked burgundy,

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.460 align:middle line:84%
because burgundy is
red, red and brown.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's the color of
money and survival and family

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.410 align:middle line:10%
and putting roots
down, et cetera.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.612 align:middle line:10%
And we all know that my hair
is natural and so beautiful.

00:37:56.612 --> 00:37:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so pretty.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:58.490 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I think we're matching
here for a reason.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Your teachings are magical.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: Thank you.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.285 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Magical.

00:38:05.285 --> 00:38:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: And
you are magical.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.621 align:middle line:84%
And it's time you let
everybody else help you.

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, thank you.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.785 align:middle line:84%
>>BARON-REID: You don't
always have to be that one.

00:38:13.785 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I like
it, but it is changing.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:18.097 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for seeing me.

00:38:18.097 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BARON-REID: My pleasure.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And for seeing so
many and helping so many.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.650 align:middle line:90%
You know that role.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.240 align:middle line:84%
