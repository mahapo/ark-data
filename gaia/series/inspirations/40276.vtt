>> Lisa Garr: Hi.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.679 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
Gaiam Inspirations ,

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.115 align:middle line:84%
and my guest today
believes that the quality

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:19.486 align:middle line:84%
of your life mirrors the quality
of the questions that you ask.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.787 align:middle line:90%
Communication expert

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.356 align:middle line:84%
and transformational leader
Niurka asked herself these

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
empowering questions to create
lasting results in her life.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.329 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're going
to start today's show

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.064 align:middle line:90%
with a question for you.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:36.569 align:middle line:84%
How can you be even more aware
of the unlimited opportunities

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:40.073 align:middle line:84%
that surround you in
your life right now?

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.343 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly the question
that Niurka asked herself

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.645 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're going
to be discussing today,

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.981 align:middle line:90%
about unlimited possibilities

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.816 align:middle line:84%
through your thoughts
and your words.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.851 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:52.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Thank you.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.587 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled to be
here with you.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:55.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Me, too.

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be such a
great hour because you're

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.661 align:middle line:84%
such a fascinating woman and
you have so much texture to you.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:02.862 align:middle line:90%
So tell me first of all,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.697 align:middle line:84%
where were you raised,
your upbringing?

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.499 align:middle line:84%
Where did you guys
come from, your family?

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.234 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I was born in Miami.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Miami.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And my family came
from Cuba, they were fleeing

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.408 align:middle line:84%
from the Castro regime,
and I grew up there.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.912 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I left
when I was 15 years old.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:19.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Why did you leave?

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Why did you leave?

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I -- you know,
I always joke and say

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.149 align:middle line:90%
that I was on this quest.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.551 align:middle line:90%
But it was true, it was a quest.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:28.253 align:middle line:84%
It was a quest for freedom and
for truth and for enlightenment.

00:01:28.253 --> 00:01:29.722 align:middle line:90%
I was really -- but back then,

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:30.957 align:middle line:84%
I called it running away
from home [laughter].

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Running
away from home.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:33.426 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.227 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: 15?

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:35.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: 15 years old.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Frustrated with what?

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I was
frustrated because --

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.934 align:middle line:84%
of my inability to communicate
with my family, but also,

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.037 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of unanswered
questions.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:46.104 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Did you feel that
you were different than them

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:47.774 align:middle line:90%
or you didn't fit in or?

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I felt
different most of my life.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.378 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I grew up with
a very loving household.

00:01:53.378 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: A very
strict household.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.451 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
questions that I had,

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.055 align:middle line:84%
I had a very expansive
imagination, a lot of ideas.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.691 align:middle line:84%
I knew inside that
I had a purpose,

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
although I had no idea
what that was or how

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.629 align:middle line:90%
to bring it into reality.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.499 align:middle line:84%
And I started asking
a lot of questions.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:13.198 align:middle line:90%
Like, who am I?

00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:13.933 align:middle line:90%
And what's my purpose?

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.435 align:middle line:90%
And why am I here?

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.303 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is the
universe and who is God?

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.071 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:19.072 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Was anybody else

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.608 align:middle line:84%
in your family asking
those questions?

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: It was
in a different way.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
They were following very
specific, you know, paths.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.251 align:middle line:84%
They were following very
specific doctrines, you know.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:36.022 align:middle line:84%
And I had really big questions
about the nature of existence

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:38.224 align:middle line:90%
and the nature of life.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I didn't feel
that there was a place there

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:45.498 align:middle line:90%
to really be understood and to.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I can see this
started at an early age.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.235 align:middle line:84%
We have this great picture
of you at two years old

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.205 align:middle line:84%
and you basically look
just mad [laughter].

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Because, like, this
is not working for me.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.675 align:middle line:90%
Look at this picture.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.343 align:middle line:90%
You're at church, right?

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:58.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: That's funny.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.546 align:middle line:90%
I do remember that.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:00.113 align:middle line:90%
That's...

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:01.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You do?

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:01.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...me
at two years old.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.082 align:middle line:90%
I remember that day.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:06.753 align:middle line:84%
And if you look all the way
in the back, my mom and my dad

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:11.424 align:middle line:84%
and my brother, they're back
there and I remember being upset

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:15.828 align:middle line:84%
because I felt that I had
direct connection to spirit

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.297 align:middle line:90%
or a connection to source.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:20.233 align:middle line:84%
And although I loved
the ceremonial part

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.368 align:middle line:90%
and the ritual of.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Church.

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Yes.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.206 align:middle line:84%
I really had a challenge
with the idea that I had

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:31.444 align:middle line:84%
to have someone intercede
on my behalf.

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:32.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: [Laughter]
You did not like that.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.448 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I just
knew it and I was made.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:37.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So fast-forward
to 15 years.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.218 align:middle line:84%
You decide to run
away from home.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.053 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I did.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.721 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And where did you go?

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You know, I
didn't know where to go.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.226 align:middle line:84%
I went from couch to couch
to couch for a while.

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:48.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:49.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I stayed
with friends.

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:54.167 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the time I had a
old beat up red Honda Civic

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.936 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I would sleep
in my car or I would drive

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to the airport and I would
watch the planes fly.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.744 align:middle line:84%
And I would imagine that I
was on one of those planes

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:08.581 align:middle line:84%
and that I was going somewhere,
to some far exotic land,

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.184 align:middle line:84%
and that I was creating
this life that was different

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:14.186 align:middle line:90%
than the one that I was living.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:14.988 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You had big dreams.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:17.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I had bid dreams.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, you know,
things got really challenging

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.565 align:middle line:84%
and I did go back home for a
period of time and, you know,

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.768 align:middle line:84%
really intended to
reconnect with my parents.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.103 align:middle line:90%
Because I knew somehow

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.905 align:middle line:84%
that I would never evolve
unless I figured out how to...

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...come into
a space of harmony.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:36.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Coming
into a space of unity.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So then, how
did you connect with --

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.915 align:middle line:84%
and I understand
that you became one

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:48.421 align:middle line:84%
of Tony Robbins' lead
sales girls as a teenager,

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.989 align:middle line:90%
which is no small task.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:51.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is something
that people.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I was 19 when I...

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:53.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: 19.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...started
working with him.

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:55.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: People wait, I mean,

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:58.231 align:middle line:84%
try to get to that
level 30, 40 years old.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:01.534 align:middle line:84%
How did you master
the task of sales

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:05.505 align:middle line:84%
in the Tony Robbins
platform at 19?

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: How did
I master the sales?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.575 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was committed.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, devoted to figure
out a way to experience freedom.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.783 align:middle line:90%
Freedom was a big drive for me.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:20.586 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, freedom meant
having the financial abundance

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:23.322 align:middle line:84%
to be able to fully
be self-sufficient

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:90%
and take of myself.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.993 align:middle line:84%
So nobody would hire
me because --

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.961 align:middle line:90%
for a job because I was the kid.

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.864 align:middle line:84%
You know, a regular
paying salary job.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:35.635 align:middle line:84%
So the only job I could
get was 100% commission.

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:37.637 align:middle line:84%
Now, originally I didn't
get hired for Tony Robbins.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.973 align:middle line:84%
I actually got hired by a
promoter who used to put

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:45.378 align:middle line:84%
on events for Brian Tracy and
some other speakers and experts.

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:48.948 align:middle line:84%
And they used to call
me The Kid back then.

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:49.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: And, you know,

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
what ended up happening
was he went bankrupt.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, the promoter.

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.622 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: The promoter
went bankrupt

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:59.959 align:middle line:84%
and didn't pay me my last check,
which was an $8,000 check.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Instead, he gave
me a big black suitcase

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:05.398 align:middle line:90%
of personal development tapes.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:06.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And said, "You
can keep all the tapes, Kid.

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:08.634 align:middle line:90%
It's just business."

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.104 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:13.606 align:middle line:84%
How you do your business
is how you live your life.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:17.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So I drove
to the desert,

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.612 align:middle line:84%
not knowing where I was going
to go, what I was going to do,

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:90%
listening to these tapes.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Tony Robbins?

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: They were
all kinds of tapes.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Tony was in there

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:27.253 align:middle line:84%
and they had all
different types of experts.

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And I went down there
and I started searching.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.693 align:middle line:84%
I started hiking, not knowing
what I was going to do next.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.994 align:middle line:90%
And I started searching.

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.429 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is my purpose
and what am I here to do?

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:39.065 align:middle line:84%
What, you know, what
is the next step?

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And what is the highest choice?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.369 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading and
journaling and asking questions.

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:44.937 align:middle line:90%
And then, I got a phone call.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:45.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then,
I got a phone call

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
on this roaming 800 number
that I had and it was someone

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.912 align:middle line:84%
who had worked at the
previous company who went

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.914 align:middle line:90%
to go work with Tony Robbins.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.718 align:middle line:84%
And they had told
them about this kid

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.887 align:middle line:84%
who had broken a
lot of the records.

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:01.854 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:02.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then,
I got a call.

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:03.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And they said,
"We heard about you.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.625 align:middle line:90%
Send us a video."

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:06.726 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Did you have.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:07.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I didn't
have a video [laughter].

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.831 align:middle line:84%
I went and bought a video
camera and shot a video

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:15.434 align:middle line:84%
of myself doing a presentation
without an audience.

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:17.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That is such a,
I mean, it's a great story

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:22.175 align:middle line:84%
in so many ways, because you
have -- you started from nothing

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.477 align:middle line:84%
and you just kept
asking the questions

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:28.014 align:middle line:84%
and you're insatiably
curious and you needed to find

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:30.583 align:middle line:90%
out what made you tick.

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.518 align:middle line:84%
And then, opportunities
would just come.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.954 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you --
the paper lays itself

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.756 align:middle line:90%
down as you put your foot on it.

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:39.192 align:middle line:84%
And in -- that seems to be
the way that you were living.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:42.061 align:middle line:84%
Many of us live our
lives like this,

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:90%
but you have figured it out.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.965 align:middle line:84%
So you went to go -- you
went to meet with Tony

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and you obviously got that job.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I did.

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And where
did that take you?

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:55.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You know, it took
me to the place of knowing

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:59.445 align:middle line:84%
that all the power to create
my life by design is within me.

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:03.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: It took me in to
that place of knowingness.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.952 align:middle line:84%
And when you say that the
ground is there for you,

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.119 align:middle line:90%
it's like you don't know.

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:09.956 align:middle line:84%
I used to say to myself
that with faith the size

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:13.259 align:middle line:84%
of a mustard seed, I
will move mountains.

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: And what I found was

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.697 align:middle line:84%
that when I would come
into a situation...

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...grounded in that,
just hauling in, you know,

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.903 align:middle line:90%
that certainty, that faith,

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:25.838 align:middle line:84%
that I was always given
firm ground to walk on.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.941 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes, I would say, which
is a great quote, wings to fly.

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.076 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.845 align:middle line:84%
Yes. We have a picture
here of you with Tony

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.014 align:middle line:90%
and you're -- you look great.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I was
blonde back then.

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:37.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You were a little.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: So.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I mean, you were a kid.

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, that took you to
places all over the world.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.755 align:middle line:90%
You got to travel, right?

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:46.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: 16 different
cities in just

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:49.795 align:middle line:84%
under fie years while
I was working with him.

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.497 align:middle line:84%
Plus some of the
international travels.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:52.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And you got to --

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.233 align:middle line:84%
you were just a sponge for
the information, right?

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:55.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I was a sponge.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.638 align:middle line:84%
I was -- plus, it wasn't
just the work with Tony.

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:01.474 align:middle line:90%
I was consistently studying.

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:06.445 align:middle line:84%
I took every ancient wisdom
text, the  Bhagavata , you know,

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:10.182 align:middle line:90%
the  Upanishads , the  Veddas .

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.485 align:middle line:84%
You know,  A Course in
Miracles , New Thought texts,

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:15.288 align:middle line:84%
that's mine -- all of these
and I made them a study.

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:21.627 align:middle line:84%
So I was very deep into Jnana
Yoga, or the path of knowledge,

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:25.264 align:middle line:84%
or the path of wisdom,
or seeking to understand.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:28.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Do you feel
that you have --

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.136 align:middle line:84%
this is something that
you've done before?

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.705 align:middle line:90%
Does this feel familiar to you?

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:33.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: My life's work?

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:34.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:35.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Absolutely.

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:36.776 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In what way?

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:39.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: It's a flow.

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:42.949 align:middle line:90%
It's timeless.

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:45.318 align:middle line:84%
It's like I forget
everything and I slip

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:48.955 align:middle line:84%
into this eternal realm where
things are flowing through me.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:49.922 align:middle line:90%
There's no trying.

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:52.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Tell me
about that knowing.

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:56.128 align:middle line:84%
That knowing, that
it is timeless.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: The knowing that it's
timeless, it's like you come

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.533 align:middle line:84%
into this place where
you expand.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:01.834 align:middle line:90%
You feel this expansion.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:05.204 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you're
holding a container.

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:08.274 align:middle line:84%
And there is no what about
this or what about that?

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.710 align:middle line:90%
There's none of these thoughts.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.413 align:middle line:90%
It's all unity, it's all one.

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:16.682 align:middle line:84%
And then, from that place,
you're able to receive all.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:19.618 align:middle line:84%
You're able to navigate
through anything.

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:23.122 align:middle line:90%
And things come to you.

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:24.657 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. You live in gratitude.

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:25.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:26.292 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You live
in appreciation.

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:28.327 align:middle line:90%
You live in beauty.

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.829 align:middle line:90%
You create value.

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:31.163 align:middle line:90%
You're in the creative space.

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:32.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In that slow.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:37.703 align:middle line:84%
In this picture that we have of
you at this Wall Street bull...

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:39.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: That's a.

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...your body caught
up to what you were creating.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.808 align:middle line:90%
You look pretty excited.

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:84%
You're what -- tell us
a little bit about this.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: This is so
great because this is

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
like coming full circle at
the beginning of my career,

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.984 align:middle line:90%
what launched my career.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:53.152 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this picture
was actually taken

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.221 align:middle line:84%
when I was working
with Tony Robbins,

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
but the first time I had my
experience on Wall Street,

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.693 align:middle line:84%
with the Wall Street
charging bull, if you will,

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:05.031 align:middle line:84%
was when I worked for
that previous promoter.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, interesting.

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: That's a
very interesting story

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.468 align:middle line:90%
because back then, I was the kid

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:11.704 align:middle line:84%
and I would get all
the appointments

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:12.905 align:middle line:90%
that no one else wanted.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:90%
It was like the scraps.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.708 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:19.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: But I started seeing
myself producing the results

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:22.815 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted in my mind.

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:25.151 align:middle line:90%
I started envisioning it.

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:29.121 align:middle line:84%
Big and bright and crisp and
clear and fully expansive.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:31.857 align:middle line:84%
And then, one day I
had opportunity call.

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.326 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it was on
my brick-sized cell phone.

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.629 align:middle line:84%
It was back with -- one of
those and my manager said,

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.097 align:middle line:90%
"Can you get to Wall Street?

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:39.632 align:middle line:84%
We have a very important
appointment.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:40.566 align:middle line:90%
It's been scheduled for weeks.

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.368 align:middle line:84%
They're expecting
the top trainer.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.937 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else is in meetings
and he had an emergency

00:11:44.937 --> 00:11:46.439 align:middle line:90%
and you're our last choice."

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.875 align:middle line:84%
Not -- still that
great [laughter].

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I
said, "I'm ready."

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:52.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:54.046 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I went down
there and I remember, you know,

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:59.151 align:middle line:84%
I took the underground
and I ran up the stairs

00:11:59.151 --> 00:12:01.487 align:middle line:84%
and I locked eyes
with this bull.

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:02.321 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: And I felt terror.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.893 align:middle line:84%
19. I remember I had real
curly hair and a velvet jacket

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.228 align:middle line:84%
that I bought at
the thrift store...

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: [Laughter] Wow.

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:13.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...that I used
to recycle with my outfits.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:17.703 align:middle line:84%
And when I took the elevator
up to that penthouse floor

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:21.173 align:middle line:84%
of this big firm and it
opened the doors and I went

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.575 align:middle line:90%
to the receptionist and I said,

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:26.245 align:middle line:84%
"I'm the trainer that's
scheduled to do your, you know,

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.481 align:middle line:84%
your sales mastery
workshop this morning."

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.417 align:middle line:84%
She looked at me like, "Grab
a seat," and she called

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
up the leader and she said
-- I'll never forget this.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.722 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Shirley
Temple's here to see you."

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:38.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh [laughter].

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:40.459 align:middle line:90%
In front of you?

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Well, yeah.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.594 align:middle line:90%
And he...

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, wow.

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...walked out
looking for the trainer,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.832 align:middle line:90%
like, over my shoulder.

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:49.235 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never forget the
first thing he asked me.

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Are you going
to do this by yourself?"

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, wow.

00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I walked in there
and I poured my heart, mind,

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.277 align:middle line:90%
and soul into this presentation

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.813 align:middle line:84%
that I had created
all by myself.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:03.149 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the end
a miracle happened.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:04.683 align:middle line:84%
It was very challenging
for a while.

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.252 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
tension in the room.

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.387 align:middle line:84%
And the, the decision
maker looked at me

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:11.157 align:middle line:90%
and he said, "I'm going."

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:12.391 align:middle line:90%
He said -- and he got up

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:13.826 align:middle line:84%
and he actually said
something a little different.

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:16.328 align:middle line:84%
He said to everybody else, "This
kid's got balls to come in here

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:17.863 align:middle line:90%
and talk to you like this."

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:18.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:19.298 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: And I'm going.

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:21.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:22.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then, it was
a huge success that day.

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:23.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, my goodness.

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:24.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And the next
day, he had me on the floor

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:26.438 align:middle line:84%
of the Stock Exchange
and introduced me

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:28.974 align:middle line:84%
to all the major players
and made phone calls

00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:31.277 align:middle line:84%
to all the other leaders
within the company.

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:33.546 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning
of my career.

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:34.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, what
a success story.

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:35.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: That was
the beginning.

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:36.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: But it's because --

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.851 align:middle line:84%
now, I know that you
practice the techniques

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:41.153 align:middle line:84%
of neuro-linguistic programming
and you've learned it

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:43.088 align:middle line:84%
and you've perfected
it and evolved it.

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:47.092 align:middle line:84%
And so, for -- but those
techniques really worked

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:49.495 align:middle line:84%
for you, didn't they,
in the beginning?

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:50.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: They did.

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:51.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In the beginning.

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:52.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And it
was a combination.

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.601 align:middle line:84%
It was never really just
like NLP techniques.

00:13:55.601 --> 00:14:00.806 align:middle line:84%
I was really looking for how all
this different wisdom connected

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:01.774 align:middle line:90%
with everything else.

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.475 align:middle line:84%
I always loved making
connections.

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:08.547 align:middle line:84%
So it was my spiritual practice,
my study, my, you know,

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:10.683 align:middle line:84%
learnings into the
realms of language.

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.618 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's one of the
things I love about NLP,

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:14.053 align:middle line:90%
is that it is so malleable.

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:15.921 align:middle line:84%
You can -- I mean,
it wasn't designed

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.523 align:middle line:90%
that way, but you can shape it.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:22.795 align:middle line:84%
It's there to help you create
something more with it.

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:23.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Absolutely.

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.298 align:middle line:84%
It's like a framework
is how I see it.

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:28.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So what have you
evolved that into now,

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:30.502 align:middle line:84%
those techniques
that you learned,

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:32.471 align:middle line:84%
that you use, that
you've shaped?

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:33.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Sure.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:34.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What are those now?

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:35.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well,
NLP, which stands

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:37.876 align:middle line:90%
for neuro-linguistic programing.

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:38.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:39.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Okay?

00:14:39.478 --> 00:14:40.813 align:middle line:84%
And it studies human
excellence and --

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:43.449 align:middle line:84%
that studies the hidden
determinants of behavior,

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:45.317 align:middle line:84%
what makes people
do what they do.

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:49.154 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these teachings
teach into the mind.

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, connecting
your conscious mind

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.825 align:middle line:90%
with your subconscious mind

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:55.294 align:middle line:84%
so you could really
be in alignment.

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:59.898 align:middle line:84%
And teaches a lot
into the mental body.

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:03.769 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have all of these
different aspects to who we are.

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:06.739 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're multi
dimensional beings.

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:10.442 align:middle line:84%
So what I've done with my
work as I've, you know,

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:14.046 align:middle line:84%
evolved it to bring in the
wisdom of how do you teach

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:16.081 align:middle line:84%
into the mental body,
the emotional body,

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:20.753 align:middle line:84%
the energetic body, you
know, the physical body, too,

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.822 align:middle line:84%
and connecting to the
wisdom of the heart.

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:24.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Very nice.

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:25.491 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:26.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: NLP a lot of
times is in the head.

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:27.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:28.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And the
head can miscreate.

00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:32.765 align:middle line:84%
If you're using your
will to create something,

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.534 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you got to
unwind what you just did.

00:15:36.534 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: When you connect
the wisdom of your mind

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:42.574 align:middle line:84%
with the wisdom of your heart
and you let your heard lead

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:46.278 align:middle line:84%
and then your mind becomes this
powerful tool to bring things

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:50.115 align:middle line:84%
into actualization, now
you're creating an alignment

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.383 align:middle line:90%
with your true purpose.

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:54.553 align:middle line:84%
Now you're creating an
alignment with your true will.

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:57.389 align:middle line:90%
The will of your authentic self.

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:59.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And this is what
you call supreme influence?

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:00.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Yes.

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Supreme
influence is a way of living.

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:06.532 align:middle line:90%
It is a way of being.

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:07.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And when
you're living this way,

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:12.071 align:middle line:84%
you create harmony, cooperative
harmonious relationships.

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:16.108 align:middle line:84%
You produce successful
results as a natural action.

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.443 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:19.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I would just say,
I just saw the movie  Jobs

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:22.614 align:middle line:84%
about Steve Jobs and we're
talking a little bit about this,

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
about how much of a
visionary and like --

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and, I mean, a stratospheric
visionary.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.425 align:middle line:84%
He was. And to create what
he created, with that vision,

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:36.362 align:middle line:84%
back in the '80s or
whatever, he had --

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:39.832 align:middle line:84%
or the '60s, of a
personal computer

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.467 align:middle line:84%
in every single person's
living room,

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:44.002 align:middle line:84%
which had never even
been thought of.

00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:46.672 align:middle line:84%
There were mainframes in giant
buildings with giant servers.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:51.477 align:middle line:84%
And he had this vision, but
to get that communicated.

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:53.779 align:middle line:84%
His original vision was
to do it with heart.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:57.483 align:middle line:84%
He had heart as the
center of his intention.

00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:01.086 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't get translated
through to what it became,

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
a major corporation
with the boardroom.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.759 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, the members of
the board and the officers

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.461 align:middle line:84%
of the corporation didn't
go that far with it.

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:12.264 align:middle line:90%
So he had a challenge with that.

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:15.467 align:middle line:84%
So when you say supreme
influence, I mean,

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:17.269 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've
studied his work as well

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:19.438 align:middle line:90%
and read his book and so forth.

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:24.209 align:middle line:84%
Where could he have used that,
those techniques, to infiltrate

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:27.279 align:middle line:84%
that sense of heart
into his vision?

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:33.352 align:middle line:84%
To marry that massive vision
and heart into a corporation?

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:34.686 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Into corporations.

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:36.522 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot of the work
that I do in corporations...

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:37.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:40.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...is really --
coming from the nucleus,

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:43.796 align:middle line:84%
that center of what is
the heart of our purpose?

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.631 align:middle line:84%
What is the heart
of our company?

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:48.834 align:middle line:84%
And how do we communicate
that on all levels?

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:51.937 align:middle line:90%
I mean, one is living it fully.

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:55.007 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that he had a
vision, which was with heart.

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:57.109 align:middle line:84%
You know, really coming
into an awareness.

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Am I fully living?

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.648 align:middle line:84%
As the leader, you know, am I
full living the full experience

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:05.617 align:middle line:90%
of this heart-centered mission?

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:07.019 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:11.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then, how can I
align with a close core group

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:14.293 align:middle line:84%
of people and engage them
in that same conversation?

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:15.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:17.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So -- because
a company is only as good

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:20.532 align:middle line:84%
as the conversations
happening within that company.

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:22.534 align:middle line:84%
Just like a family is
going to be a reflection

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:23.869 align:middle line:84%
of the conversations
in that family.

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: A nation is
going to be the reflection

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:27.039 align:middle line:84%
of the conversations
in the nation.

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.308 align:middle line:90%
So I would have said alignment.

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.375 align:middle line:90%
First, alignment.

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:31.944 align:middle line:90%
Alignment within the leader.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:32.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:34.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Alignment within him.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: See, Steve
was a genius.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.785 align:middle line:84%
I think inside at some levels,
there were some misalignments

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.353 align:middle line:90%
that he was experiencing.

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.522 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's a
great insight to go,

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:44.756 align:middle line:90%
hmm, let me get curious...

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:45.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:46.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...about that.

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:47.059 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fan of his work.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.994 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrilled because, I mean,

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:51.463 align:middle line:84%
his vision transformed
the way we.

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:52.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Communicate.

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.432 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And what I love
about him is he was committed

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.969 align:middle line:84%
to bring it in with
elegance and beauty.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:57.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.670 align:middle line:90%
And style.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.371 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:59.371 --> 00:18:59.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: And style.

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:01.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:01.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So first,
that inner alignment.

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.609 align:middle line:90%
Then, alignment within the team.

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:06.278 align:middle line:84%
And then, aligning
the practices.

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:08.881 align:middle line:84%
You know, how you
treat your employees.

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:10.382 align:middle line:90%
How you treat your team.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:13.619 align:middle line:84%
You know, what decisions do
you truly make day-to-day?

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:17.055 align:middle line:84%
And are those decisions
grounded in the heart center?

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That is true.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.726 align:middle line:84%
Most corporations do
lose sight of that

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:22.561 align:middle line:84%
because they're chasing the
bottom line, which, of course,

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:90%
needs to pay for the businesses.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.398 align:middle line:90%
But it does -- yeah.

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:90%
How do you have heart to pay

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.336 align:middle line:84%
for the bottom line is
the interesting challenge.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:34.873 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
Niurka at work here on stage

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:37.276 align:middle line:84%
at one of the business
conferences

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:90%
that she's lectured at.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.244 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.712 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of other things
have changed throughout the

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:44.016 align:middle line:84%
organization and our pipeline
is about five times larger

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:48.453 align:middle line:84%
at Proforma as we go towards
being almost a half a billion

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:50.589 align:middle line:84%
dollar company to a
billion dollar company.

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.224 align:middle line:84%
Right? It's all about
your pipeline.

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:55.027 align:middle line:84%
Our pipeline at Proform
has transformed thanks

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.028 align:middle line:90%
to Niurka's teaching.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: The quality
of your life,

00:19:57.229 --> 00:20:00.032 align:middle line:84%
the quality of your
results, mirrors the quality

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.802 align:middle line:84%
of the mental and emotional
states that you frequent.

00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:11.243 align:middle line:84%
Yes. What if you knew that
you create as you speak,

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:17.082 align:middle line:84%
that your word has
that much power?

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:21.253 align:middle line:84%
That when you're speaking,
you are literally speaking

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:25.857 align:middle line:84%
into existence and that every
cell in your body aligns

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.392 align:middle line:90%
with what you declare?

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:32.397 align:middle line:90%
The words I Am have power.

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:38.136 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you speak after the
words I Am you will attract,

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:41.139 align:middle line:84%
you will create,
and you will become.

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:46.979 align:middle line:84%
How you move influences
how you feel.

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:49.147 align:middle line:90%
Flexibility is power.

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:50.616 align:middle line:90%
The most flexible person

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:54.886 align:middle line:84%
in any interaction is
the influencing factor.

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:56.888 align:middle line:90%
People don't respond to reality.

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:59.591 align:middle line:84%
They respond to their
map of reality.

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:03.328 align:middle line:84%
So your ability to really tune
in, ask the right questions,

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.063 align:middle line:90%
to elicit someone's map.

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:08.166 align:middle line:84%
That's why one of my
favorite questions is How So?

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.434 align:middle line:90%
Whenever someone says, "How so?

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.268 align:middle line:90%
How do you mean?"

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:11.737 align:middle line:90%
begin to gather more information

00:21:11.737 --> 00:21:14.072 align:middle line:84%
so you could really speaking
into their listening.

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:20.412 align:middle line:84%
It's having the sensory acuity,
which means the awareness

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to know first where
is your state?

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:28.987 align:middle line:84%
Before you pick up that phone
to schedule that appointment,

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:31.523 align:middle line:84%
before you pick up the phone
to schedule the appointment,

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:34.826 align:middle line:84%
before you go into that
meeting, where is your state?

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:37.229 align:middle line:84%
Your ability to influence
your world of opportunities is

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:39.297 align:middle line:84%
to really be able
to see what kind

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:40.699 align:middle line:84%
of person you're
communicating with.

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:42.467 align:middle line:84%
Having the awareness,
having the sensory acuity

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.536 align:middle line:84%
to realize everybody's
different.

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:45.504 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's unique.

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:46.705 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
specific ways.

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you can tune into
that, then you can speak

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:52.477 align:middle line:84%
into their listening and
inspire Yes and inspire action.

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.646 align:middle line:84%
So one of the keys is
becoming very aware,

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.348 align:middle line:90%
very conscious of my language.

00:21:56.348 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Not just the language you
use with your clients.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.319 align:middle line:84%
First, the language
you use with yourself.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:06.458 align:middle line:84%
You know why this is so
important is because in life

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and in business, you do
not describe what you see

00:22:16.268 --> 00:22:20.839 align:middle line:84%
but rather you see
what you describe.

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.674 align:middle line:90%
The ultimate rapport is?

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:25.343 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate rapport is
rapport with you and you.

00:22:25.343 --> 00:22:27.546 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
ever felt where a part

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
of you wants one
thing and another part

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.049 align:middle line:84%
of you wants something
else and you feel torn?

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:33.418 align:middle line:84%
You're out of rapport
with yourself.

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:38.757 align:middle line:84%
So my life's work is all about
bringing that into that unity.

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:40.125 align:middle line:90%
Okay?

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:41.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So tell me a little
bit more about supreme influence

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:43.228 align:middle line:90%
and how -- and what you teach

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:45.897 align:middle line:84%
that creates the lasting
results I was talking about?

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Okay.

00:22:47.165 --> 00:22:53.605 align:middle line:84%
So supreme refers to the
most empowered authentic you.

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And influence, as I define
it, is in word fluency.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's when your thoughts,
your words, your language,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.917 align:middle line:84%
your body language, your
beliefs, your goals,

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.853 align:middle line:90%
your values, your sense of self,

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
your vision are all
genuinely on the same page.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah.

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: In alignment.

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:17.763 align:middle line:84%
And when you're living a life
that's congruent in that way,

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:19.931 align:middle line:84%
that's where you have
power, inner power.

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:23.902 align:middle line:84%
So my courses, my
curriculums, my trainings,

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:27.739 align:middle line:84%
my retreats are all about
creating that inner alignment.

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:30.575 align:middle line:84%
What stops people sometimes
is they feel fragmented.

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like a part of them
wants this and a part

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.080 align:middle line:84%
of them wants that, and
they feel this push-pull.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.351 align:middle line:84%
So it's about bringing
all of this into unity.

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:40.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So.

00:23:40.552 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So you tap into
your intuitive wisdom,

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.822 align:middle line:84%
you tap into higher
consciousness.

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:44.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Sometimes,

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.558 align:middle line:84%
that requires breaking
old habits, though.

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:47.192 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:48.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Uh-huh.

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:49.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...if you're trying
to go into a new level,

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:52.164 align:middle line:84%
a new realm, and you've got
this vision and you want

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:54.399 align:middle line:90%
to create that, yet you go back

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:58.303 align:middle line:84%
to old habits during your
day-to-day unconscious life,

00:23:58.303 --> 00:24:01.139 align:middle line:84%
which -- it happens,
which absolutely happen,

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:04.743 align:middle line:84%
how do you constantly
live that vision

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:06.645 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing
mundane things?

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:07.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Okay.

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's why
it's important to be

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.482 align:middle line:90%
in a different conversation.

00:24:10.482 --> 00:24:14.486 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I do my courses
and retreats, I'll bring people

00:24:14.486 --> 00:24:16.721 align:middle line:84%
for two days, three
days, five days.

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:18.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Uh-huh.

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:20.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: To bring them out of
that environment, so they're not

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:25.897 align:middle line:84%
in that usual automatic
response, and then guide them

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:27.199 align:middle line:90%
through specific practices.

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:29.167 align:middle line:90%
Like if someone's doing a habit.

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:30.735 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'll give you
just an insight on a habit

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:33.205 align:middle line:84%
because that's one of the
words that we're talking about,

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:36.675 align:middle line:84%
is there's a trigger or
something that happens

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:38.243 align:middle line:90%
that launches in that old habit.

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:39.244 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So whatever
that is.

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:43.014 align:middle line:84%
They hear something and then
all of sudden they have that...

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Respond.

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...that stream
of negative thoughts...

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:46.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...or
whatever that is.

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:47.652 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Or negative
response or -- yes.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.354 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Or -- exactly.

00:24:49.354 --> 00:24:51.223 align:middle line:84%
So what I'll do is
I'll guide them

00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:54.025 align:middle line:84%
to undercover what's
that trigger?

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.561 align:middle line:84%
And I do this through
questions, I do this through,

00:24:56.561 --> 00:24:58.797 align:middle line:90%
you know, specific inquiries.

00:24:58.797 --> 00:24:59.998 align:middle line:90%
What's the trigger?

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:03.001 align:middle line:84%
And then, I have them come
to a clear understanding

00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:06.671 align:middle line:84%
of what is it that I've
been doing in the past?

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:11.877 align:middle line:84%
And then, what I do is I have
them create a clear image

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:14.312 align:middle line:84%
of what they'd like
to do instead.

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:15.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Instead of
having that trigger.

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:17.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Instead of
having the trigger lead you

00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:21.353 align:middle line:84%
to this series of, you know,
let's say whatever that is.

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:23.488 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting at the table
and they are overeating

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:26.758 align:middle line:84%
for a very similar,
or a simple, example.

00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a sequence of
events that happens,

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.795 align:middle line:90%
and it's pretty consistent.

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:34.266 align:middle line:84%
So when I can create
a new vision, a new --

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:36.468 align:middle line:84%
I call it an internal
representation,

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:41.773 align:middle line:84%
a new possibility, and
they're in that possibility,

00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:43.842 align:middle line:84%
it's not just something
out there, they're in it.

00:25:43.842 --> 00:25:45.977 align:middle line:84%
It's big, bright, crisp, and
clear and they're looking

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:49.981 align:middle line:84%
through their own eyes and
they're fully integrated

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:52.484 align:middle line:84%
in that, then I can guide
them through a process to have

00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:55.921 align:middle line:90%
that new vision replace...

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:56.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:58.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...that old pattern.

00:25:58.056 --> 00:25:59.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.459 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's becoming really
crystal clear about that

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:03.094 align:middle line:84%
and doing a visualization
around it

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:06.164 align:middle line:84%
and replacing it
with the old pattern.

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:07.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: It's -- yes.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.734 align:middle line:84%
Because it's creating
a powerful vision

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:11.403 align:middle line:84%
that you're literally
moved towards.

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:14.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's what it means
to co-create your future.

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I would say to create it,
to create a new future.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.279 align:middle line:84%
To break out of the box
from where you came from

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:24.316 align:middle line:84%
and what ignited you to
something that's different.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:25.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: You got to see it.

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:26.384 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:26.384 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
You got to create -- it's
very difficult for someone

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.689 align:middle line:84%
to create a result if they
can't see in their mind.

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:31.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:33.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You've got to
create your results up here,

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.427 align:middle line:84%
and that's what all the best
athletes of the world do.

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:37.329 align:middle line:84%
That's what the greatest
entertainers...

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...they create
their results in advance

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.703 align:middle line:84%
in their mind, and
then they step into it.

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:45.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:47.272 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because
sometimes you can get lost

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:50.241 align:middle line:84%
in those, though, those
details of what it means to you.

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:53.578 align:middle line:84%
So say the athlete, and then
they got lost in the training

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:56.247 align:middle line:84%
and then they don't actually --
don't go to the competitions.

00:26:56.247 --> 00:26:58.416 align:middle line:84%
Or if you get lost
in the details

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:00.218 align:middle line:84%
of something, to
try to create it.

00:27:00.218 --> 00:27:00.986 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:02.354 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Absolutely.

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:04.756 align:middle line:84%
That's why I teach something
in one of my courses called --

00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:09.761 align:middle line:84%
and I call it being very
specific in the abstract.

00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:10.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.629 align:middle line:90%
That's.

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:12.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: [Laughter] It's like
a little brain floss, right?

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:13.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:27:13.064 --> 00:27:14.466 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:17.268 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So it's like you get
really clear about what it is

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:19.137 align:middle line:90%
that you're intending to create,

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:23.074 align:middle line:84%
although you're anchored
into the essence.

00:27:23.074 --> 00:27:24.342 align:middle line:84%
That way, you don't
get tunnel vision.

00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:25.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Give me an example.

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:26.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Okay.

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:28.046 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's say that
somebody wants to envision

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:31.516 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to, you
know, purchase their new car.

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:34.352 align:middle line:84%
Okay? And they want to,
you know, materialize

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:35.887 align:middle line:90%
or manifest a new -- all right.

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:38.656 align:middle line:84%
If they start seeing
themselves in a particular car,

00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:39.991 align:middle line:90%
it's a particular color.

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:43.728 align:middle line:84%
I've got this Porsche 911
Turbo, it's red, it's da da da.

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:45.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:46.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Then, they start
getting very anchored in, right,

00:27:46.564 --> 00:27:48.333 align:middle line:90%
to a particular reality.

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:52.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: If you can just get
clear with what is the essence

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:54.472 align:middle line:84%
of what I ultimately want,
and this is interesting

00:27:54.472 --> 00:27:56.041 align:middle line:84%
because when I first
started my company,

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I actually got my
very first car --

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.313 align:middle line:84%
I was 24 years old
and I got it on trade

00:28:02.313 --> 00:28:03.948 align:middle line:90%
at a Mercedes-Benz dealership.

00:28:03.948 --> 00:28:07.085 align:middle line:84%
A brand new red Mercedes
and I knew that day.

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:08.486 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm going
to manifest a car

00:28:08.486 --> 00:28:09.621 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to do it on trade.

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:11.423 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:12.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What did you trade?

00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:14.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I traded my
corporate training services

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:16.928 align:middle line:84%
that didn't even
exist yet [laughter].

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:19.697 align:middle line:84%
I had literally just
transitioned from Tony Robbins.

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:21.132 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure what
I was going to do.

00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:22.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my gosh.

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:22.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I just
knew I couldn't be

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:23.935 align:middle line:90%
on the road any more.

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:25.637 align:middle line:84%
I was so grateful for
my experience there.

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.872 align:middle line:84%
I just was ready
for a new journey.

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:30.942 align:middle line:84%
And within four days,
I said, okay.

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:31.876 align:middle line:90%
I'm off the road.

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:34.412 align:middle line:84%
I had rented cars
for five years.

00:28:34.412 --> 00:28:36.314 align:middle line:84%
I said it's essential
for me to get a car.

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:38.349 align:middle line:84%
And then, I said I'm
going to trade for it.

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Because I was 24.

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:41.553 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a lot of credit.

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:46.157 align:middle line:84%
I made -- all the money I made,
I was mostly on a cash basis.

00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:48.226 align:middle line:84%
And I went in and I
traded for a brand new car.

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But when I knew that that's
what I was going to create,

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.899 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing it, specific
and the abstract, in my mind.

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:56.735 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it could have
been a red Mercedes,

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:84%
but it could have
been a black Porsche

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:03.108 align:middle line:84%
or it could have been a
silver BMW or a whatever.

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:05.543 align:middle line:90%
It was the experience.

00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:06.611 align:middle line:90%
What is the essence of it.

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.846 align:middle line:84%
And that's so important
because...

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:09.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:10.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...a lot of times,
people want to materialize it

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:11.916 align:middle line:90%
or manifest is a popular word.

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:12.684 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The detail.

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:13.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: A relationship.

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:16.387 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can't be
looking for 6'2", dark hair,

00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:18.089 align:middle line:90%
blue eyes, and, you know...

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:22.694 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...because you
might miss that person that is

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:25.363 align:middle line:84%
so perfect for you
as your beloved

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.365 align:middle line:84%
because you're so
in tunnel vision.

00:29:27.365 --> 00:29:28.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:29.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So it's about
being clear, but expanded.

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:30.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wait.

00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:32.003 align:middle line:90%
So you traded your services.

00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I did.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What did you do?

00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I went in and met with
them for about eight hours.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.211 align:middle line:90%
On the whole way down there,

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:42.046 align:middle line:84%
I was asking myself
empowering questions.

00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:43.314 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
empowering questions earlier.

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:43.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:44.749 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You know,
I was saying

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:47.385 align:middle line:84%
to myself how can I communicate
with this person in a way

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:49.721 align:middle line:84%
where they know for a fact
that I'm the best person

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:52.157 align:middle line:84%
on the planet to help
them reach their vision?

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:53.091 align:middle line:90%
How can I create.

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:53.892 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is
the sales person?

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:54.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: This is me -- no.

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:55.493 align:middle line:90%
The leader.

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:56.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, you did it.

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:56.861 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:58.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: The decision maker.

00:29:58.196 --> 00:30:00.031 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm asking myself
all these questions before I

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:00.732 align:middle line:90%
walked in.

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:90%
By the time I walked in,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.235 align:middle line:84%
the deal was already
done in my mind.

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.304 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: And I basically --

00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:11.676 align:middle line:84%
we consecrated that deal on a
handshake and then I came back

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:12.944 align:middle line:90%
and I said I'm going

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:14.646 align:middle line:84%
to put together this training
curriculum and I came in

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.147 align:middle line:90%
and I customized it for them.

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:17.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And.

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:18.116 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And it
opened a lot of doors.

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: For them?

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well, not only
for them, but it opened doors

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:26.291 align:middle line:84%
for a number of different
opportunities in corporations,

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:29.227 align:middle line:84%
with other Mercedes-Benz
and a number of other.

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:31.529 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, within
a few months of that,

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:34.132 align:middle line:84%
I started doing consulting
and training for one

00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:36.067 align:middle line:84%
of the top Mercedes-Benz
dealers.

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.702 align:middle line:84%
And within seven months
of working with me,

00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:41.639 align:middle line:84%
they became number
one in the world.

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:42.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my God.

00:30:42.707 --> 00:30:44.042 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: At the time,
for Mercedes-Benz.

00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:46.311 align:middle line:84%
And then, they became the
number two dealer of all dealers

00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:84%
in the United States;
all makes and models.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness,
within seven months.

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:51.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Within seven months.

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:53.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you had no
idea what you were doing

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:53.751 align:middle line:90%
when you were trying.

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.053 align:middle line:90%
You just wanted a car.

00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I was reading.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's right.

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I'd go to the
bookstore and I'd get books

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:84%
on consulting and management and
I was self-teaching myself this.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.162 align:middle line:84%
But I was hungry and I
was committed and I cared.

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:05.163 align:middle line:90%
I cared.

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:06.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Where do
you get this fire?

00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:08.299 align:middle line:90%
Where do you get this passion?

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:10.101 align:middle line:90%
Where do you get that fire?

00:31:10.101 --> 00:31:12.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You know, someone may
say that it's my Cuban roots,

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:15.773 align:middle line:84%
but may be a little bit of
that, because there's a lot fire

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:16.341 align:middle line:90%
around my house.

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:17.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:18.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: It's deeper
than that.

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:20.979 align:middle line:90%
It's my purpose.

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:24.949 align:middle line:84%
I know that I arrived
on Earth for a reason.

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:26.417 align:middle line:90%
We all have.

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:27.919 align:middle line:90%
Every one of us.

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:30.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you connected
to that purpose every second.

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I'm
in that purpose.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.391 align:middle line:90%
I am that purpose.

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:36.027 align:middle line:84%
I'm the full expression
of that purpose.

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.528 align:middle line:90%
And we all have that.

00:31:37.528 --> 00:31:39.264 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so sweet
to be here with you.

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.965 align:middle line:84%
You're living in
the full expression

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:42.934 align:middle line:84%
of your purpose and
we're in this...

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:45.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...co-created space.

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Les.

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:46.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: And flow.

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.406 align:middle line:90%
And every person has that.

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:52.143 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, my
vision in life is

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:56.948 align:middle line:84%
to see every being
authentically living

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:59.250 align:middle line:84%
in their purpose
and in their power.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:00.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: That's why I write.

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:01.419 align:middle line:90%
That's why I speak.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:01.953 align:middle line:90%
That's why I create.

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:03.154 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:03.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You teach.

00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:04.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Yeah.

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:05.423 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:06.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, we want
to be more like you.

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:09.227 align:middle line:84%
So let's learn a little
bit about how to do

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:12.597 align:middle line:84%
that because the how in me
needs to be satiated now.

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.965 align:middle line:90%
So this particular side

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that you've given us a
little bit of a teaching...

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Okay.

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ...curriculum here.

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:20.938 align:middle line:84%
Is the bits of information
that come to us at all times,

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:23.441 align:middle line:84%
what does that have to do
with living in that purpose?

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:24.976 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: This is really
important because --

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually how I introduce
part of my work, is that we live

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.183 align:middle line:84%
in a universe of
infinite possibility.

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:33.918 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, enlightened
masters have said

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.053 align:middle line:90%
that for centuries.

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:38.122 align:middle line:84%
Right now, science is
saying yes, we all are.

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:41.893 align:middle line:84%
That there's infinite
possibilities that surround us

00:32:41.893 --> 00:32:45.196 align:middle line:84%
in our life, opportunities,
in all areas.

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:50.568 align:middle line:84%
And that our neurology and
our brain can't take in all

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:52.203 align:middle line:90%
of these possibilities.

00:32:52.203 --> 00:32:54.706 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be like
trying to download the whole...

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:55.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Too much.

00:32:55.406 --> 00:32:55.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...Internet.

00:32:55.973 --> 00:32:56.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:32:56.641 --> 00:32:57.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: You know?

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:58.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.577 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Without
a search engine.

00:32:59.577 --> 00:33:01.813 align:middle line:84%
It would be too much information
to what we do all day long.

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:03.481 align:middle line:84%
And we all do it, is
we do three things.

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:09.220 align:middle line:84%
We delete, we distort,
and we generalize reality,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and we pick up a tiny little
bit of what's going on.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.859 align:middle line:84%
And what we're picking
up in a field

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:17.061 align:middle line:84%
of infinite possibilities
is what's in alignment

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:19.997 align:middle line:84%
with our vibration,
with our vibe.

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:90%
We are all vibrational beings.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And what's creating our vibe
is our focus, our thoughts,

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:30.508 align:middle line:84%
our language, you know, our
belief systems; off of this.

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:35.213 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when you shift
what's going on within you,

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.614 align:middle line:90%
what's out here shifts.

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:37.949 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah.

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:41.519 align:middle line:84%
So you change the filters of
how you're seeing these bits

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.321 align:middle line:90%
of information coming in.

00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:46.424 align:middle line:84%
So you no longer
delete; you take on.

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:48.559 align:middle line:84%
Or you no longer distort; you
look at it for what it is.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:51.062 align:middle line:84%
You just change those different
types of filters, right?

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:52.196 align:middle line:90%
Is what you're saying?

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there's still -- yeah.

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:54.966 align:middle line:84%
There's still maybe other
things that you delete.

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:57.468 align:middle line:84%
You might be deleting negativity
for example, you know,

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:59.837 align:middle line:84%
and not allowing that,
you know, to come in.

00:33:59.837 --> 00:34:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But yes. Because we
realize from this teaching,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.977 align:middle line:90%
is that we've been programmed.

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.879 align:middle line:90%
You know, psychologists say

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:13.684 align:middle line:84%
that by the time we're eight
year old, we've had 25,000 hours

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.186 align:middle line:90%
of linguistic programming.

00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:16.521 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:18.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So words have been
downloaded into our minds.

00:34:18.088 --> 00:34:20.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Our personalities
informed.

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:21.893 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Imprinting
ideas about who we are

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:24.327 align:middle line:84%
and what's possible and about
money and about relationships...

00:34:24.327 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...and about, you
know, our own self worth.

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:32.303 align:middle line:84%
And these ideas will
drive someone's life.

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:35.239 align:middle line:84%
I say you're in that
law of association,

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.408 align:middle line:84%
where your thoughts are
all just being associated

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:39.143 align:middle line:90%
from things -- from the past.

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:41.379 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
until we wake up.

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm-hmm.

00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:43.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: You go wait a minute.

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:47.418 align:middle line:84%
I am more than this,
you know, programming.

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:49.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's amazing they
don't teach this in school.

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:50.854 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:34:50.854 --> 00:34:53.825 align:middle line:84%
You're continuing to stay
in the frames of association

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:55.693 align:middle line:84%
and school, that
there's a side here

00:34:55.693 --> 00:34:57.128 align:middle line:90%
to talk about the mind frame.

00:34:57.128 --> 00:34:58.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Ah, the mind frames.

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:02.266 align:middle line:84%
Yes. It's like we look
at life through frames.

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:04.602 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if somebody
let's say is anchored

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:90%
in a really negative frame...

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:10.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...they can look
at something that's wonderful

00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:12.643 align:middle line:84%
and they could say,
well, not for long.

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:13.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:14.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Not for long.

00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:15.746 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:21.252 align:middle line:84%
Well, because perception
is projection.

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:24.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Explain
that [laughter].

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: In other words,
perception is projection.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.861 align:middle line:90%
We do not describe what we see.

00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:31.929 align:middle line:90%
We see what we describe.

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:36.801 align:middle line:84%
What we're perceiving
is in direct alignment

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.135 align:middle line:90%
with the vibration we're in.

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:39.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why you could
have five people look

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.205 align:middle line:90%
at the exact same circumstance

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and get five completely
different.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:43.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Responses.

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:43.841 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Yeah.

00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:46.711 align:middle line:84%
One person sees opportunity,
the other person sees problem,

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:47.812 align:middle line:90%
the other problem sees --

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.614 align:middle line:84%
because they're looking
through the lens

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:51.415 align:middle line:90%
of their own experience.

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:53.918 align:middle line:84%
And part of my evolution
was coming into my own life,

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:54.752 align:middle line:90%
is saying wait a minute.

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:55.953 align:middle line:90%
There's some things here

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:58.022 align:middle line:84%
that I'm really not
seeing in an empowered way.

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Uh-huh.

00:35:59.023 --> 00:35:59.991 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:01.792 align:middle line:84%
So how do we change
those things?

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.728 align:middle line:84%
What are the steps
that we can make to --

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:06.130 align:middle line:84%
now that we've got
this great realization,

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.465 align:middle line:90%
to change those filters?

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:09.367 align:middle line:84%
Even to be aware of them in
the first place is, I think,

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:10.401 align:middle line:90%
the first step, right?

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:11.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Awareness
is the first step.

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Because the second
you become aware of it,

00:36:13.804 --> 00:36:15.873 align:middle line:90%
you're not in it anymore.

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.308 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're observing it.

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:20.111 align:middle line:84%
You get new insights, new
resources, new understandings.

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:23.548 align:middle line:84%
So really, we're moving
out of association,

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:27.585 align:middle line:84%
or the conditioned mind, or,
you know, looping patterns

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
of thought where one thought
leads to another leads

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.323 align:middle line:84%
to another, without any
real purpose or direction.

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:35.426 align:middle line:84%
We rise from that,
first through awareness.

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:38.229 align:middle line:84%
You know, observing it,
becoming curious about it.

00:36:38.229 --> 00:36:40.264 align:middle line:90%
I love becoming curious.

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I always inspire my
students to become curious,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.069 align:middle line:84%
because then you get insights
that you wouldn't otherwise see.

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:49.507 align:middle line:84%
And then, from associate,
we arise into contemplation.

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:51.842 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's like, hmm.

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:53.511 align:middle line:90%
Where's the origin of that?

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:54.712 align:middle line:90%
Is that really true?

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: What else
could this mean?

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:58.115 align:middle line:90%
What's the gift in it?

00:36:58.115 --> 00:37:01.686 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh, nice, to be
grateful for it eventually.

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:02.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: What am
I grateful for?

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:04.422 align:middle line:90%
How can I transform this?

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:06.257 align:middle line:84%
Who do I know that can
support me with it?

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:08.326 align:middle line:84%
So rather than just being
anchored in the experience,

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:12.463 align:middle line:84%
now you're observing
it, contemplating it.

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:15.499 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there,
you get direction.

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:16.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So this side
that we're looking

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:84%
at here is the first position,
third -- the second and third,

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:23.774 align:middle line:84%
is basically a great
template for which to go

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.776 align:middle line:84%
through these unconscious
patterns

00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:27.511 align:middle line:84%
in your life, is
first you do what?

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.913 align:middle line:90%
First you?

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:30.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well,
first, it's realizing

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:32.049 align:middle line:84%
that every time we're
perceiving something,

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:35.152 align:middle line:84%
we're in a particular
perceptual position.

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:35.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: We're in it.

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:36.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: We're.

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:37.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:39.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So if somebody's,
like, stuck in a problem,

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.958 align:middle line:84%
stuck in a problem, stuck in a
problem, in their experience,

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.194 align:middle line:84%
they're like in the
experience looking

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:44.262 align:middle line:90%
out through their own eyes

00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:47.465 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
identified to the problem.

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:49.967 align:middle line:90%
This is my problem.

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.068 align:middle line:84%
You can hear it in
their language.

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:51.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Absolutely.

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:53.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I have this problem.

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:56.007 align:middle line:84%
Well, the second you step
out of the problem...

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:57.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:58.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...and you
know what's that like.

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:00.578 align:middle line:84%
Just put the problem up
on a movie screen and,

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.547 align:middle line:90%
you know, take a relaxed seat.

00:38:03.547 --> 00:38:04.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, okay.

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:06.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And observe that
person on the screen that looks

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:08.786 align:middle line:84%
like you or that
you on the screen,

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:11.922 align:middle line:84%
and now become very
curious and go hmm.

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:13.724 align:middle line:84%
Okay? What can I
learn from this?

00:38:13.724 --> 00:38:16.661 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're in a totally
different perceptual position.

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:17.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:19.597 align:middle line:84%
So let's take an
example here of debt.

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:20.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Okay.

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:21.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay?

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:23.167 align:middle line:84%
So you think you're in this
problem and you're in debt

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:25.836 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get credit and
you can't afford anything

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:27.672 align:middle line:84%
and you just project
yourself up on this screen.

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:29.273 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
-- first of all,

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:31.509 align:middle line:90%
it looks like you in that debt.

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:32.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Okay.

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's got to be
kind of painful to look at.

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:35.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You know, well
first, you want to put that up

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:37.581 align:middle line:84%
on the screen and over
here, you go in neutral.

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:38.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: You know?

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:40.084 align:middle line:84%
So you're kind of
just watching a movie.

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:41.485 align:middle line:90%
You can get some popcorn.

00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:42.586 align:middle line:90%
Get some popcorn.

00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:43.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I wouldn't want
to watch that movie.

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:44.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well, like
here's what you can do.

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.123 align:middle line:84%
You can put it a
little further back.

00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:48.059 align:middle line:84%
You could even make it
black and white if you want.

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:49.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:50.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And you
know what you could do

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:53.464 align:middle line:84%
in there is you could bring
in a model of possibility.

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:54.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Explain.

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: In other
words, you can see that you

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:59.270 align:middle line:84%
on the screen doing that
thing that you used to do...

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:03.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...that you used to
stress and you used to worry

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:06.644 align:middle line:84%
and you used to complain
and have doubt.

00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:09.313 align:middle line:84%
Well now, that you on the screen
is going to be next to a model

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:11.982 align:middle line:84%
of possibility, and that model
of possibility is someone

00:39:11.982 --> 00:39:17.488 align:middle line:84%
who exemplifies that new
behavior or that new state

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:90%
that you want, which is what?

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.492 align:middle line:90%
Confidence, certainty.

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:22.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, okay.

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: O...

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:24.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Someone that would
exemplify that, not just some

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:25.763 align:middle line:84%
that would come in
in angel wings

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.631 align:middle line:90%
and take away all the debt.

00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:28.566 align:middle line:90%
You're talking about...

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.433 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Well.

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...some
-- like a model.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.302 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Yes.

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:32.503 align:middle line:84%
Because here's the thing,
is that like a lot of times,

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.171 align:middle line:84%
people are going, oh,
can I get the angel wings

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:34.805 align:middle line:90%
and this and that?

00:39:34.805 --> 00:39:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.209 align:middle line:84%
You can cheat yourself
from the amazing growth,

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:40.611 align:middle line:84%
the profound experience,
of the journey

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:43.414 align:middle line:84%
of your own transformation,
which may be a part

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:47.151 align:middle line:84%
of your own purpose to somehow
support others in navigating

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.519 align:middle line:90%
through their challenges.

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:51.622 align:middle line:84%
And it's you being in that
experience, in that moment,

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:55.893 align:middle line:84%
that's going to carve
you to become the master.

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.261 align:middle line:90%
That greatest challenge.

00:39:57.261 --> 00:39:59.263 align:middle line:84%
You know what I found, Lisa,
is that the greatest challenges

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:02.533 align:middle line:84%
in my life have evolved to
become my greatest gifts.

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:05.536 align:middle line:90%
That is such a key distinction.

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:84%
That not wanting to go into
the fairy tale I can pray

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.241 align:middle line:90%
for all this to work out.

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.009 align:middle line:90%
I know in divine intention.

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:15.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, if you really
go into the nitty-gritty part

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:18.549 align:middle line:84%
of the lessons, you're
apt to get it faster; huh?

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Yes.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.653 align:middle line:84%
And to be willing to
go into the dark place.

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:24.789 align:middle line:84%
You know, earlier you had
asked me what does Niurka mean?

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:26.957 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we didn't
go into too much detail,

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:29.994 align:middle line:84%
but Niurka is actually a
Russian expression corresponding

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:31.128 align:middle line:90%
to mink.

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:31.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mink.

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:32.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Mink.

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:34.498 align:middle line:84%
You know what the
interesting thing about mink?

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No.

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:38.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Mink goes into
the deep dark places.

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:39.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The animal?

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:40.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: It's a
source of wisdom.

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:40.838 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:41.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Huh.

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:43.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You know,
it's -- as a totem...

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:44.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:45.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...if you will.

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:47.111 align:middle line:84%
But it's one of the gifts that
I feel that I have been brought

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:84%
on this planet with, to
be able to guide people

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.982 align:middle line:90%
in a safe loving container.

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: To those deep.

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:57.154 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Into these deep
dark places, to source

00:40:57.154 --> 00:41:01.392 align:middle line:84%
and integrate profound wisdom,
and then to bring that through

00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:03.861 align:middle line:90%
in their offering, their gifts,

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:06.564 align:middle line:84%
their expression;
whatever that is.

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:07.765 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, it's also

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:10.935 align:middle line:84%
about creating rich
environments to thrive.

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.303 align:middle line:90%
And that's like, you know,

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.905 align:middle line:84%
the lotus flower grows
in the muddy swamp.

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:17.408 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times go, "I want
the lotus, but not the swamp."

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:17.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:18.709 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:20.044 align:middle line:90%
The diamond in the rough.

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:21.345 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So you have to get through
the perturbation

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:24.481 align:middle line:84%
of the -- around the rough
to get to the diamond.

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:25.916 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:29.854 align:middle line:84%
In -- so in this stepped process
of putting yourself up on

00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:33.157 align:middle line:84%
that screen, becoming the
observer, and then looking

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.358 align:middle line:90%
for the model of reference,

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:37.061 align:middle line:84%
that is a great way
of breaking a habit.

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:39.496 align:middle line:84%
Breaking -- and creating
a new one.

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:40.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Absolutely.

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.599 align:middle line:90%
And you know what's interesting?

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.534 align:middle line:84%
Is when I guide people through
this and they're looking

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:45.436 align:middle line:90%
at that model of possibility,

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:47.238 align:middle line:84%
they can see how
that person moves.

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:51.742 align:middle line:84%
They can describe them
sometimes to me to a T. So then,

00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:53.844 align:middle line:84%
the question becomes,
well wait a minute.

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:56.847 align:middle line:84%
You have a full and complete
understanding of what would work

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:58.782 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
area of your life.

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:02.152 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
know it intellectually,

00:42:02.152 --> 00:42:04.755 align:middle line:90%
but it hasn't integrated yet.

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:06.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: But then.

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:08.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Through a series
of exercises and practices...

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:09.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:10.494 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...I get them to
start breathing different.

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, interesting.

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You know, the
mind controls the body,

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.865 align:middle line:90%
but the breath directs the mind.

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:17.902 align:middle line:84%
I get them to start
feeling it in their body.

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Uh-huh.

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:23.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then, from that
place, shifting their thoughts,

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:25.576 align:middle line:84%
shifting their language,
shifting their focus

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:27.711 align:middle line:84%
with something as simple
as breathing different.

00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:28.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's o.

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:30.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Holding
your body different

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You know that phrase
that nothing is created

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:34.151 align:middle line:84%
without it being
a thought first?

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Uh-huh.

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:39.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So then, that exercise
gets it into being the thought.

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:43.160 align:middle line:84%
The feeling, the emotion,
the breath, all of that,

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.664 align:middle line:84%
it actually allows you to
go into a different reality.

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:47.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Exactly.

00:42:47.932 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And that's where
you start to create from.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Mm-hmm.

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because you
can feel it and see it.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.337 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:54.672 align:middle line:90%
Okay. So [laughter].

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:58.842 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a look here
at Niurka talking about being

00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:01.345 align:middle line:84%
on purpose and what that
really, really means.

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.147 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
to a corporation.

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:04.815 align:middle line:90%
This is to a group of employees.

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:10.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Every single one
of you has a unique purpose.

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:14.425 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
you that only you can bring

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:20.431 align:middle line:84%
into the world and that when
you bring it, fully expressed,

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.733 align:middle line:84%
our experience of
reality collectively

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.569 align:middle line:90%
as one family on Earth elevates.

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The quality of your
life mirrors the quality

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.076 align:middle line:90%
of the questions that you ask.

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:34.712 align:middle line:84%
When you change, the
world around you changes.

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.981 align:middle line:90%
That you have that much power.

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:42.319 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind controls
the body, but it's the breath

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:44.722 align:middle line:90%
which directs the mind.

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:47.124 align:middle line:84%
Fine. Open up your
heart's center.

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:48.792 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring all of
your consciousness,

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:50.928 align:middle line:84%
all of your energy,
all of your attention.

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:53.263 align:middle line:84%
What we're speaking, what we're
putting out into the world,

00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:57.201 align:middle line:90%
it's what's returning unto us.

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:59.370 align:middle line:84%
That the word has
power to create.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:04.808 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe it's
possible to be so purposeful

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:11.482 align:middle line:84%
with your communication that you
only speak things into existence

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:14.585 align:middle line:84%
that are in alignment with what
you're committed to create?

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:15.719 align:middle line:84%
Universe of infinite
possibilities.

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:18.389 align:middle line:84%
You're not looking
out there in your life

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.591 align:middle line:84%
and in your business ventures
and your relationships

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:23.794 align:middle line:84%
and describing what
you're actually seeing.

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:25.129 align:middle line:90%
That's not what's going on.

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:27.064 align:middle line:84%
What's going on is
that what's showing

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:29.933 align:middle line:84%
up is mirroring what
you're focused on,

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:34.138 align:middle line:84%
what you're declaring, what
you're speaking into existence.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:36.874 align:middle line:84%
The pictures, sounds, and
feelings in your mind.

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you shift what's in
here, what's out here shifts.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:42.846 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we're going
to get really purposeful,

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:47.718 align:middle line:84%
to ask questions with purpose,
poise, precision, and power.

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:51.922 align:middle line:84%
Every time you speak,
your statements

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:53.557 align:middle line:90%
and your questions contain

00:44:53.557 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:84%
within their structure what
I call a presupposition.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:05.502 align:middle line:84%
Presuppositions are imbedded
assumptions in language

00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:09.773 align:middle line:84%
that trigger your brain to
find things in a universe

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.742 align:middle line:84%
of infinite possibilities
that are in alignment

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:13.110 align:middle line:90%
with what you declare.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.545 align:middle line:84%
Give you an example of
an empowered question.

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.146 align:middle line:84%
You could write this one
down and you could utilize it

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:17.581 align:middle line:90%
for yourself if you wish.

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It was a question
I created years ago

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's elevated every area
of my life, is the question

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:84%
of how can I be even more aware
of the unlimited opportunities

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.361 align:middle line:84%
that surround me in
my life right now?

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:34.264 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does that
question presuppose?

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:37.835 align:middle line:84%
How can I be even more
aware presupposes what?

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:90%
That you're aware.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:44.641 align:middle line:84%
Of the unlimited
opportunities presupposes what?

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:46.944 align:middle line:90%
And exists when?

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.045 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:49.279 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:53.684 align:middle line:84%
Your values and your beliefs
are underlying drivers

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:56.286 align:middle line:84%
that fuel your behaviors
and actions

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.255 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately determine
your results.

00:45:58.255 --> 00:46:06.563 align:middle line:84%
That's because I have this
vision and the vision is

00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:13.704 align:middle line:84%
to see every being on
this planet, every one,

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:19.910 align:middle line:84%
authentically living in
their purpose and power.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm here [applause].

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:30.621 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:35.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So when you bring these
conversations into corporations,

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:37.427 align:middle line:90%
how do you frame it to these --

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:40.497 align:middle line:84%
to major corporations where
things might be broken,

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:43.634 align:middle line:84%
there might be discontentment
within the employees.

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:44.935 align:middle line:84%
They're not all aligned
to the purpose.

00:46:44.935 --> 00:46:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's broken.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.874 align:middle line:84%
So how do you go in and start
this conversation that's touchy

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:53.777 align:middle line:90%
feeling, but important?

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well,
that's a great question.

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:58.815 align:middle line:84%
I come in and I really
meet them where they are,

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:02.553 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
the experience is.

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:05.956 align:middle line:84%
And I honor where they are
and I make it okay to be

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:08.625 align:middle line:84%
where they are as
a starting point.

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.793 align:middle line:90%
And then, I believe really clear

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:12.596 align:middle line:84%
with where are we
committed to be?

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.098 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then, I
go through the process

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:18.435 align:middle line:84%
of understanding what's been
the barriers or the obstacles

00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:20.637 align:middle line:90%
or the limitations in the way?

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:24.308 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there, guiding
through a series of different...

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:25.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's important.

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...processes

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:28.011 align:middle line:84%
of bridging the gap
from here to here.

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the past I was
doing a lot of consulting work.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.382 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't do as
much consulting work

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:36.119 align:middle line:84%
because the results I get in
my courses are so profound

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:39.323 align:middle line:84%
that I guide the leaders
to bring their leaders

00:47:39.323 --> 00:47:40.791 align:middle line:90%
and their teams to the courses

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:43.460 align:middle line:84%
because then they learn the
skills to be able to come back

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.295 align:middle line:84%
and create it for
themselves rather

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.097 align:middle line:84%
than to need me to
be in there...

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:48.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That makes sense.

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:48.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...navigating
these changes

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:50.200 align:middle line:90%
for them, and I prefer that.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:50.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That makes sense.

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:51.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: So.

00:47:51.902 --> 00:47:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you give
them this framework.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.873 align:middle line:84%
So we have beliefs, focus,
language, and physiology.

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:57.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Yes.

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:59.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We didn't touch
as much on language.

00:47:59.009 --> 00:47:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about that.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: About language?

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well, I always
say when you open your mouth

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.282 align:middle line:84%
to speak, how many
possibilities are there

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:06.350 align:middle line:90%
of what could come out?

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:08.552 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: To really
focus on that.

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well, that there's
infinite possibilities.

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:11.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, okay.

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:13.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Of what could
come out of our mouth.

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:18.362 align:middle line:84%
But something comes out and that
what we're speaking really does

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:18.862 align:middle line:90%
two things.

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:20.330 align:middle line:90%
It shapes.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:24.067 align:middle line:84%
It shapes our life
and it reveals.

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So do you think
about it before you say it?

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:28.005 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're doing?

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:29.406 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really consciously
think about what you're going

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:31.642 align:middle line:84%
to say and how many
possibilities can be loaded

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:33.543 align:middle line:84%
in the statement that about
to find it or you're not?

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:34.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: No.

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:35.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That would be kind
of lots going on, right?

00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:39.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I get very
clear with my intent.

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:40.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:42.686 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then,
what happens is that I --

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:45.322 align:middle line:84%
there's certain things that
are important to understand.

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:48.925 align:middle line:84%
For example, every statement you
make, every question you ask,

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:53.730 align:middle line:84%
contains within its
structure a presupposition.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:57.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Which is an imbedded
assumption within language

00:48:57.334 --> 00:49:00.103 align:middle line:84%
that causes your brain to
go find things that are

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:02.205 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with
what you're declaring.

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So just
understanding that.

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:06.109 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once I did a
corporate and one man came

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:07.944 align:middle line:84%
up to me right before I
was getting to go on stage

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:11.315 align:middle line:84%
and it was like 2008 and it was
in the real estate business.

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:12.783 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, you
know, "Can you talk

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:15.952 align:middle line:84%
about how we can
survive in this market?"

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:17.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:18.588 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: He had a
minute, 30 seconds, with me.

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:20.223 align:middle line:90%
He could have asked me anything.

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:23.060 align:middle line:84%
He could have opened the door
of opportunity, but the word

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.628 align:middle line:84%
that came out was how
am I going to survive?

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:25.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Survive.

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Which instantly
let me know the state

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:28.432 align:middle line:90%
that he was in.

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:30.701 align:middle line:84%
But also, it activates
his energy field

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:32.569 align:middle line:90%
to go look for survival.

00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:33.937 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is
that in a universe

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:36.406 align:middle line:84%
of infinite possibilities,
it's all available.

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:39.843 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you call in,
you will experience.

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:42.245 align:middle line:84%
So that's when, you know,
I guided him to go, okay.

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, what are the
presuppositions

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.082 align:middle line:90%
in this question?

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:47.484 align:middle line:84%
Now, you opened with one
of my favorite questions.

00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:47.984 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:48.985 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:50.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I
have so many of them.

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:52.889 align:middle line:84%
The presuppositions
in that question,

00:49:52.889 --> 00:49:59.963 align:middle line:84%
how can I even more aware of
the unlimited opportunities

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:03.934 align:middle line:84%
that surround me in my
life right now presupposes

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:06.169 align:middle line:84%
that you are aware that
there's unlimited opportunities

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:08.538 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
surrounding you.

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:09.940 align:middle line:90%
And you know what's interesting,

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.209 align:middle line:84%
I recently did a
corporate engagement

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:15.545 align:middle line:84%
and someone had gift the
founder and president

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.848 align:middle line:84%
of this company one
of my multimedia sets.

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.549 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea who I was.

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:22.419 align:middle line:84%
It sat on his desk as a
paperweight for years.

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:25.021 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
he started commuting.

00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:28.725 align:middle line:84%
He was commuting and he said,
"Let me just listen to it.

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:30.193 align:middle line:90%
Might as well listen to it."

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:32.229 align:middle line:84%
That one question and
the other questions

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:35.432 align:middle line:84%
that he started asking himself,
he said -- he called our office.

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:36.666 align:middle line:90%
"I've never met you.

00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:38.168 align:middle line:84%
This has completely
transformed my life.

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:41.438 align:middle line:84%
In the last 90 days,
our opportunity pipeline

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:47.177 align:middle line:84%
of our business has increased
by over $50 million, in 90 days.

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:48.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Just by.

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:50.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And it's specifically
because of the function

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:53.183 align:middle line:84%
of the questions that I, as a
leader, have been asking myself,

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:55.318 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to be
the keynote speaker

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.554 align:middle line:90%
at our national convention.

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:58.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Awesome.

00:50:58.188 --> 00:50:59.156 align:middle line:90%
Awesome. Wow.

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:00.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So questions
have power.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, they do.

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And words have power
and language have power.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And those four,
when they come together,

00:51:06.363 --> 00:51:09.166 align:middle line:84%
the language, beliefs,
focus, and physiology,

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:11.501 align:middle line:84%
they come together and
they produce a state,

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:84%
a state of mind,
a state of being.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.271 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:15.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then,
that state, that vibe,

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:18.575 align:middle line:84%
determines what you're
perceiving,

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.177 align:middle line:90%
what you're attracting...

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:20.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:21.645 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:23.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...into your life.

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:26.116 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then, those states
then turn into goals, right?

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:29.653 align:middle line:84%
You take that state of what
you want to be; yes, no?

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:30.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: This is really...

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:31.021 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I don't know.

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:31.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...great.

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:32.489 align:middle line:90%
I'm -- yeah.

00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:33.323 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I love
what you're saying

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.691 align:middle line:90%
because it's absolutely right.

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:38.562 align:middle line:84%
Call in the state and live in
the embodiment of the state;

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.330 align:middle line:84%
a state of empowerment,
a state of inspiration,

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.566 align:middle line:84%
a state of enthusiasm,
state of gratitude.

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:46.503 align:middle line:84%
Live in that state and then from
that state, consciously create.

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:48.772 align:middle line:84%
Now, what a lot of
people do is they say,

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.407 align:middle line:90%
well, I want to be happy.

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:50.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:51:50.907 --> 00:51:51.741 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:52.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I want to be free.

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:53.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:53.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I want to have peace.

00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:54.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Freedom.

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:55.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I want
to have security.

00:51:55.979 --> 00:52:00.116 align:middle line:84%
And they stay or they make
-- they stay in a state.

00:52:00.116 --> 00:52:02.853 align:middle line:84%
They declare a state
as if it's a goal.

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:06.423 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if someone says,
well, I want to really be free.

00:52:06.423 --> 00:52:07.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Explain that, though.

00:52:07.357 --> 00:52:08.391 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: This is
really important...

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...because
they're taking something

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:12.662 align:middle line:84%
that can be experienced
right now...

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.098 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: ...and they're
making it out there.

00:52:15.098 --> 00:52:17.734 align:middle line:84%
I can guide anyone to
experience peace in this moment,

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:21.104 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of people, because
they're not aware of this,

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:23.473 align:middle line:84%
they'll say to themselves,
well, I will feel peace

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:26.510 align:middle line:84%
or I will feel free once I have
this much money in the bank

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.178 align:middle line:84%
and I have the perfect
relationship and this happens

00:52:28.178 --> 00:52:31.281 align:middle line:84%
and this happens, and, you
know, I'm 100% debt free.

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:34.818 align:middle line:84%
And then, what they do is they
cheat themselves out of the joy

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:37.153 align:middle line:84%
of living in the
most empowered state.

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.688 align:middle line:84%
And because their
vibration is low,

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:40.790 align:middle line:84%
because they're not allowing
themselves to have the gift

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:44.261 align:middle line:84%
of that state, then
they can't achieve.

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.197 align:middle line:84%
So what I teach -- and I
actually teach this at a course

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:51.434 align:middle line:84%
that I do every January
about achieving big goals,

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:53.203 align:middle line:84%
goals that are in alignment
with your true purpose

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:54.538 align:middle line:90%
and with your higher self.

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:59.543 align:middle line:84%
I guide people to be in the
most empowered state first.

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:02.445 align:middle line:84%
And a great example of this is I
see people create vision boards.

00:53:02.445 --> 00:53:03.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:04.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: But while
they're creating it...

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:05.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:06.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...they have doubt.

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I hope it happens.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:07.951 align:middle line:90%
I wish it happens.

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:08.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:09.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: How is
this going to work?

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:09.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:11.054 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:11.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: I mean,
doubt gets imbedded in.

00:53:11.621 --> 00:53:12.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:14.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well, instead,
activate the state

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:17.327 align:middle line:84%
and then the goal will
happen as a natural action.

00:53:17.327 --> 00:53:19.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You gave me a great
piece of coaching on that.

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:21.364 align:middle line:84%
Because I have my
vision board on my desk.

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Okay.

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:24.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And I have it as
a screensaver on my phone.

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:25.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Oh.

00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:26.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And so, I keep
it all over the place.

00:53:26.836 --> 00:53:29.039 align:middle line:84%
So I'm constantly looking
and checking at a conscious

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.373 align:middle line:90%
and unconscious level.

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And you told me that my vision
board didn't have a title

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.813 align:middle line:90%
and the title is the essence.

00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:40.383 align:middle line:84%
And that was a brilliant
piece of coaching.

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:42.118 align:middle line:84%
Because I gave my
vision board a title.

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:43.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I love that.

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:45.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And I made it
-- the title is joy.

00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I am creating
in this vision board of mine is

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.295 align:middle line:90%
to be created with joy.

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:55.465 align:middle line:84%
And joy is the essence from
which I am creating it.

00:53:55.465 --> 00:53:57.968 align:middle line:84%
And in the -- is the
essence I am always in.

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:01.371 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes fall out of
and want to get back to.

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:02.072 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:02.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I love that.

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:03.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:04.674 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:05.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: You know, in my book
I have -- you're so welcome.

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:06.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Thank you.

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: You're so welcome.

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.511 align:middle line:84%
I have a chapter in
there or a section

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:11.414 align:middle line:84%
in a chapter called
"The Power to Name."

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:15.385 align:middle line:84%
And there is incredible
power in naming something.

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:18.288 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you have a
project, if you have, you know,

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:21.825 align:middle line:84%
something that you want to
create, to really name it

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:25.695 align:middle line:84%
with intention and that
that name will have power,

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:29.499 align:middle line:84%
it'll begin to attract things
that harmonize with a resonance.

00:54:29.499 --> 00:54:30.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's what
this name is doing.

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:32.702 align:middle line:84%
I just came up with it
yesterday in talking to you.

00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:33.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: Joy.

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:34.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So I get to -- yes.

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:34.904 align:middle line:90%
So I get to that.

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:36.039 align:middle line:90%
So -- all right.

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:38.174 align:middle line:84%
So just a last piece of
teaching here is just --

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:40.577 align:middle line:84%
kind of looks like the chakras
is what we're looking at.

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: It does; doesn't it?

00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:42.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Uh-huh.

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:43.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Actually,
this is a rendition,

00:54:43.546 --> 00:54:46.383 align:middle line:84%
my own rendition, of
a teaching in NLP.

00:54:46.383 --> 00:54:50.186 align:middle line:84%
And they call it the
neurological levels.

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:51.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:52.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: But for me, this is
living in supreme influence.

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:54.658 align:middle line:84%
It's when all aspects
are in alignment.

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:56.259 align:middle line:90%
So you see the chakras are there

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:57.894 align:middle line:84%
and at the top it's
your higher self,

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:59.462 align:middle line:84%
which is in alignment
with your vision.

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.398 align:middle line:84%
It's being in complete
alignment.

00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:05.035 align:middle line:84%
So actually, this is an exercise
that I do also in my courses,

00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:06.870 align:middle line:84%
where at the bottom
you see environment.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.372 align:middle line:84%
I'll guide people to step
in in their mind to begin

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:12.642 align:middle line:84%
to create the environment that
they're inspired to live by.

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.978 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there,
we rise to behaviors.

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:17.047 align:middle line:84%
What are the behaviors and
the actions that you're taking

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:17.947 align:middle line:90%
on a day-to-day basis?

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.649 align:middle line:90%
What are your daily practices?

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.418 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we
rise to capabilities.

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:24.621 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So how are you expanding
your capabilities to live

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:25.755 align:middle line:90%
in the full expression of this?

00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, we go to
beliefs and then we go

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.559 align:middle line:90%
to the sense of identity.

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:31.761 align:middle line:84%
And from there, my
I Am presence.

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:34.964 align:middle line:84%
Who I am in my highest
expression,

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:38.368 align:middle line:84%
in my union with whatever
you want to call it; spirit,

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:40.870 align:middle line:84%
my higher self, God,
source, energy.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:46.309 align:middle line:84%
And then, from that place, then
I guide them to come back down,

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:50.380 align:middle line:84%
bringing that highest energy in
all the levels, all the way back

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.848 align:middle line:90%
out to their environment.

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.516 align:middle line:84%
And that's what supreme
influence is,

00:55:53.516 --> 00:55:56.019 align:middle line:90%
it's creating that alignments.

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Do those.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:57.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: So it's like
an active mediation.

00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:58.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:55:58.254 --> 00:55:59.355 align:middle line:90%
No. It's great.

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:00.857 align:middle line:84%
Do the levels change
when you come back

00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:01.825 align:middle line:90%
down with that essence in mind?

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:03.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: They do.

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Because then you kind of rose
up and then when you were there,

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:11.034 align:middle line:84%
you literally feel -- it's
like your rising on octave

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and you feel that
vibrational shift.

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.906 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I have certain
music playing in the background.

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I have -- I'm all about creating
this space for transformation.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.113 align:middle line:84%
So you're lifted into
this place and then

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:25.115 align:middle line:90%
from there, you see differently.

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:29.385 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing from
a place of wholeness

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:31.354 align:middle line:90%
and unity and empowerment.

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:32.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Uh-huh.

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:33.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: And then, yeah.

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.457 align:middle line:84%
By the time you walk
back down, ooh,

00:56:34.457 --> 00:56:38.528 align:middle line:84%
you'll get to that capabilities
and you're like I am ready.

00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:39.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:42.232 align:middle line:84%
I can see how that would
completely shift any vision

00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:43.867 align:middle line:90%
or a goal that you have.

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:45.201 align:middle line:90%
It would completely change it.

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, you do this
in your courses.

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.271 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: I do.

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:49.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Tell me a little
bit about your courses

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:51.541 align:middle line:84%
and about your company
and so forth.

00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:53.109 align:middle line:90%
It's SIIA, right?

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:55.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Well, that's
my signature course, SIIA,

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:59.616 align:middle line:84%
which stands for Supreme
Influence In Action.

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:00.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:03.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And my
courses are my heart.

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:08.792 align:middle line:84%
This is where I bring my true
purpose into actualization

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and where I'm able
to do my surface work

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.164 align:middle line:84%
and to really connect with
people at a deeper level.

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:16.566 align:middle line:84%
And I have different courses
for different purposes.

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:20.336 align:middle line:84%
I mean, SIIA is a course
on communication mastery...

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:21.171 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:23.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: ...and evolved NLP.

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And it guides people to
communicate with purpose,

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.846 align:middle line:90%
poise, precision, and power.

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:30.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:57:30.947 --> 00:57:31.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And then,
you know, it's five days

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and I do another
course just for women.

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:34.417 align:middle line:90%
I love this one.

00:57:34.417 --> 00:57:35.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, nice.

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:36.586 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: It's called
The Goddess Garden.

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:37.854 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Nice.

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:39.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And it's a
three-day journey of alchemy.

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:41.024 align:middle line:90%
And, you know.

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:42.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Coming into
your power as a woman?

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:43.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: Completely
coming into your --

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:48.631 align:middle line:84%
the full spectrum of your
divine feminine power and grace.

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:50.633 align:middle line:84%
And then, how to activate
all these different energies

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.735 align:middle line:84%
and then how to balance
and thrive

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:55.038 align:middle line:84%
in the most important roles
we play in our families,

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:58.641 align:middle line:84%
in our businesses, in our
communities, in our sensuality,

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:03.780 align:middle line:84%
sexuality, and as powerful
leaders in our emerging world.

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.115 align:middle line:84%
And then, I do one that
is also very near and dear

00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:07.884 align:middle line:90%
to my heart, Neogenesis.

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:11.221 align:middle line:84%
Neo stands for new,
genesis is beginning.

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I do a
lot of deep shadow work

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.492 align:middle line:90%
where I will guide people

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to uncover what have been
the deep subconscious values

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:25.068 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs that have been
driving my life up until now?

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:27.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Seems like they're
all really good course.

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:27.837 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they...

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:28.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Niurka: They're amazing.

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:29.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ...build on.

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: And I'm
constantly evolving them.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:32.642 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:33.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: With all the
other work that I do,

00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:34.210 align:middle line:90%
the books that, you know, the.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:37.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: These are
all extensions of.

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:38.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Of these courses.

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Niurka: The courses
is the nucleus.

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Beautiful.

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:44.287 align:middle line:84%
Wow. You were such a
fountain of information,

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:45.688 align:middle line:90%
no longer a kid [laughter].

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:50.526 align:middle line:84%
You have evolved as a beautiful
woman and to be a presentation

00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:54.097 align:middle line:84%
to us, to what you've been
able to create is phenomenal.

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for being here with me

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.669 align:middle line:84%
and being the example
and the inspiration

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:01.571 align:middle line:90%
to many, many people.

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:04.307 align:middle line:84%
And if you would like to watch
my interview with Niurka,
