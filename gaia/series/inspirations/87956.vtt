00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.933 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're broadcasting
from the Sounds True Wake

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Up Festival in the
beautiful Rockies

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:84%
surrounding Estes
Park, Colorado.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.170 align:middle line:90%
So what is prayer?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it only talking to God
when you really want something

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.092 align:middle line:90%
or when you feel desperate?

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
that you do when

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
you go to a place
of religious belief?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me today
is David Frenette,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and he's a senior teacher in
the centering prayer movement.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a contemporary method
of contemplative prayer.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID FRENETTE:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.656 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be here.

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:46.634 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this centering prayer
movement-- when did this start?

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: As you
say, centering prayer

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:84%
is a contemporary form of
practice, meditative practice,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
that was initiated
about 50 years ago

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:90%
by some Trappist monks.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:84%
The Trappists are
a religious order

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
within Roman Catholicism who
are responding to the invitation

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:84%
to bring forth their meditative
wisdom into the modern world.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So they looked back into the
dusty books of the old ages

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and into their own
direct experience

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and put together this
practice, this methodology,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:90%
called centering prayer.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been taught
for 40 or 50 years,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:84%
first by those Trappist monks,
Father Basil Pennington, Father

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
William Meninger, and Father
Thomas Keating, who is my abba,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual father, and then
by a broader circle of people

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:90%
who are not monks or priests.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's disseminated
throughout different Christian

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
denominations, into people who
are-- now would self-identify

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
as being spiritual but
not religious-- that is,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.186 align:middle line:84%
not in a religious denomination
or a strong church affiliation.

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So I love this because
the wisdom that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:84%
has been brought down
from these monks,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
as you say-- I mean, they
spent years and years being

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
inward, and insightful,
and in silence.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And that sometimes isn't
practical for our modern day

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.367 align:middle line:90%
world, yet we want that.

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Exactly.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- the centering
prayer distills that silence,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and the simplicity, and the
solitude from the monastic life

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
into a simple practice that
someone can do 20 minutes

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
in the morning or 20 minutes
in the evening and have some

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
periodic retreat where they can
be more grounded and centered.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is to live
out the contemplative life

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
in ordinary life, not in a
rarefied, separate, cloistered

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
life, away from the world,
because that's what Jesus did.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
He seemed to have gone off into
the desert for a period of time

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
to pray and be transformed
and awakened to his identity--

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:90%
his deep spiritual identity.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But then, he lived
out that in the world.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.646 align:middle line:84%
He lived that out in
dialogue with people.

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, do you--
who are you praying to?

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Or are you praying to anyone?

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.122 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more of a
centering within yourself?

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: That's
a good question.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes, we think of
prayer as talking to God,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
or speaking to God, or
at least thinking of God.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But contemplative prayer
is more about listening.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's the other side
of the relationship.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Talking to God, speaking
to God is valuable.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a true
relationship with a living

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
reality, such as God is to us,
then listening is important.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And as contemplative
prayer deepens,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
the listening moves to an
immediate, direct experience

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that's more like hearing God,
where the barriers disappear

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and the in-dwelling
life of God-- God's

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
presence within-- one of
the great Christian mystics,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
John of the Cross, said, "The
center of the soul is God."

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
That reality awakens
into one's life,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a direct
hearing experience.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But the focus is not on
trying to get an experience,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
but to open up to a transforming
relationship with God

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
so that some of the
inner obstacles to being

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:84%
in life with greater
freedom are diminished,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
that neuroses and emotional
programs are lessened,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
and then one can be a little
bit more compassionate.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in that-- I love that
you said it's more of a soul.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Are you praying to the universal
God that is within all things,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.405 align:middle line:90%
including within ourselves?

00:04:30.405 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: One's praying to
or in relationship with God--

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:90%
kind of like the grounded being.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the universal presence
that's in all things,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and also, in a sense,
present in all religions.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And so centering
prayer is sometimes

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
practiced by people who are
not in a conscious relationship

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:90%
with Christ.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
because it does come out

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:84%
of this 2000-year-old
tradition--

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
the Christian monastic
and contemplative life

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:84%
established-- the life
established by Jesus.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
If one has-- if a centering
prayer practitioner has

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
a relationship with
Christ, they kind of

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
download into their practice
this additional grace

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:90%
of the tradition.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So you know how some meditation
practices like mindfulness,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:90%
which emerges out of Buddhism?

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness can be practiced
by people in our society,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and often is, who
are not Buddhist.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And just like Hatha yoga
comes out of Hinduism, but--

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.514 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's all a
practical oneness.

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: It's all
a practical oneness

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:84%
that people can access without
the religious container.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But centering prayer,
like mindfulness,

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
like Hatha yoga--
if someone does

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
open to the religious
quality-- like in centering

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
prayer, the Christian
contemplative life-- then

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
that can add a richness
to their experience.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
bit of a paradox.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
One's accessing this
universal presence of life

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.520 align:middle line:90%
that's present everywhere.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you ever heard of
the "I am" concept, the "I am"

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:84%
discourses and the people
believing "I am God."

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of that concept?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: When you
say "I am," you mean--

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.301 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am.

00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Well, describe it
a little more so I understand.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard Wayne
Dyer and various people

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:84%
say and talk about
the "I am" discourses.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:90%
I am God.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I am-- and that's basically
embodying the presence of God.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been
familiar with that?

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Or do you agree with that?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Well, actually,
it's a fascinating phrase

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
because part of the revelation
of what the divine is, what God

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
is, in the
Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:90%
is that God is, I am.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
God speaks God's name as
I am, or "I am that I am,"

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:84%
or "I am who I will be,"
in the Hebrew translation.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, Jesus says, when
he's asked who he was,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
he says before "Before
Abraham ever was, I am."

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So "I am" is an expression
of the nature of God.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So when one is in
contemplative prayer,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
one is in relationship
with the great I am-ness,

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
which is also the deep
nature of oneself.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So in Christianity, one wouldn't
really say that I am God.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm still a human being.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:90%
But the divine life is there.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't read much
of Wayne Dyer's book,

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.507 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very valuable--

00:07:47.507 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's in all the
scriptures, the word I am.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.548 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: I am, yeah.

00:07:50.548 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:90%
It's universal.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very important
thing to realize

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're not separate
from the divine.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
The divine is here
in us, enfolding us.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you get
started on this journey?

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:90%
What drew you towards this path?

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Well,
as a young man,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't raised with any
religion-- religious training.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
college, I began

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
looking for meaning
in life, searching

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
for something that
would kind of alleviate

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
my personal, neurotic
pain and give me

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:90%
a sense of what life was about.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And I started meditation,
actually, with Buddhism.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I moved from Michigan
to the Bay Area,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
which was kind of the mecca
at that time of meditation

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:90%
in the late '70s.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And I practiced Buddhism
for a few years.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, out of
that experience,

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
even on Buddhist
retreat, I began

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
to have a sense of a
loving, full presence that

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
was arising out of the
emptiness, the Sunyata,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that was opened up by
the Buddhist practice.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was associated
with Christian symbolism,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.180 align:middle line:84%
with Christ, which was
very surprising to me.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I had no relationship
with Christianity.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really have a
lot of knowledge of it,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.910 align:middle line:84%
nor any concept that there
was a living meditation

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:90%
tradition in it.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, I didn't either.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised
Catholic, but I never

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
knew about this centering
prayer movement.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:90%
You say it's 50 years--

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah,
about 45, 50 years old.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's been spread
around in some areas

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and in some churches,
but not all churches.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
You kind of have to dig
around a little bit for it.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that where you were
introduced to Thomas Keating?

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: I became a
Christian when I was 22 or 23.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.669 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By became, you
mean baptised and--

00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah, that's right.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, I immediately
started to-- well,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, if I
want to really live

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.844 align:middle line:84%
the meditative
life, what do I do?

00:09:53.844 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
idea was, well,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.704 align:middle line:90%
then you go become a monk.

00:09:56.704 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But I thought I
didn't really want

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to become a monk because
I felt in that tradition,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
you kind of isolate yourself
from the world, and perhaps

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
a little bit from aspects
of my being, emotions,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
sexuality, that I didn't
want to isolate myself from.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.959 align:middle line:84%
So I just practiced
in my ordinary life.

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, about
three or four laters,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.772 align:middle line:84%
I met Thomas Keating--
three or four years later.

00:10:19.772 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you meet him?

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: He came to
Berkeley, where I was living,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
to the Unity Church
and gave a talk.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, is this a
master, a Christian master?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:84%
He had been an abbot, and he
had just recently retired,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.509 align:middle line:84%
so he's giving a few
talks here and there.

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so it
resonated with you.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.062 align:middle line:84%
This said this makes-- you
said this makes sense to me.

00:10:43.062 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I had been practicing on
my own for a few years

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
as a new Christian,
and then I thought,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
well, here's a teacher,
and I asked him.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I asked him for some
help, and he said, well,

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:84%
he's giving this retreat, a
new retreat that he had just

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
opened up to a small group
of people-- about 12 people.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:90%
And he said you can come on it.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was held in New Mexico
at this interspiritual retreat

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
center called the
Lama Foundation.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:90%
This was in 1983.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And about 14-day retreat,
and I went there,

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:90%
and he gave his teaching.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.992 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
this is what I want.

00:11:22.992 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:90%
This is what I've been doing.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you found
your home, so to speak.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But then, to go on and
actually teach this and embody

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
this, you took it on
from there on out?

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Actually, on that
retreat, there were 12 people,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and most of those people
went on to give their lives

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and their full-time work
to the centering prayer,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
but it had not really
yet been established.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to set
up a little meditation

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:84%
community, a few of
us from that retreat.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.669 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas Keating
was our abba--

00:11:59.669 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your guide.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Our guide, yeah.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I lived there for 10
years, like a temporary monk.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did you seek other work?

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Did you get married?

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:90%
What was your life like?

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Well, after-- it
was living it like as a monk,

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and serving these
retreats, and living more

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
about-- learning more about
prayer, and community life,

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and service from the
contemplative dimension.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, after 10 years,
my commitment was over.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I had made these
renewable commitments.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt it was time
to move back into the world.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I did, and I got
a graduate degree

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.136 align:middle line:84%
and started working
as a counselor.

00:12:40.136 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And I got married,
and that's it.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And here I am.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you've had the best
of both worlds, essentially,

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.971 align:middle line:84%
but been able to practice
within a practical life.

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.345 align:middle line:84%
So what are some
of the practices

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that you carry into your
life in the centering-- front

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:90%
the centering prayer movement?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.618 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: That's
a good question.

00:12:59.618 --> 00:13:02.295 align:middle line:84%
So centering prayer
is a sitting practice.

00:13:02.295 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So you come apart, and you--
like zazen or other forms

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.024 align:middle line:90%
of meditation.

00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, the idea is
to live it in your life.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there are
certain practices

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that work with emotions and the
idea being attentive to what's

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
happening, rather
than lost in thoughts.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Practices that help
with forgiveness.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And contemplative service-- this
idea of contemplative service

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
is that we're involved in
the world, using our gifts,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:84%
helping to aleve the
problems of the world,

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
but we're letting go of our
own agendas more and more.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's trying to offer our
work and our lives as a prayer,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.640 align:middle line:90%
as a movement towards that.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's God within us
serving God in other people.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When someone comes
to you that has a problem

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
or has deep trauma
in their lives,

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:84%
how do you counsel them
using this type of method?

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this could
help people to understand

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:90%
the method a lot better.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: So the method
of centering prayer,

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
then, is to have a comfortable
posture and a natural posture,

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and to prepare oneself with
a sense of intentionality

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:84%
in opening up to God,
however you experience that.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And then-- you know, how
we understand God to be--

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and then having a
word of one or two

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:84%
syllables that you
introduce into your mind

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to represent or symbolize
your opening of your heart,

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:90%
your consent to God.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you're thinking
another thought engaged

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
with thinking, thinking
about thoughts,

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.076 align:middle line:84%
you ever so gently
return to that word.

00:14:50.076 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it a word you choose,
or is it always the same word?

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: It's
the word you choose,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and you keep it
the same over time.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't change it practice
period to practice period.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So an example would be--

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: It could be
the name of God, Jesus,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:84%
or it could be open, or
stillness, or Shalom, or be.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:84%
You can also use your breath,
so ever so gently just

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:84%
noticing your breath-- not
concentrating, but just lightly

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:90%
noticing it.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
The breath is actually
a wonderful practice

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.990 align:middle line:84%
because at the time
of Jesus, the language

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
he spoke-- they use the same
word for breath and spirit,

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:90%
ruach.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So the breath is used in
some contemplative traditions

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
in Christianity, along
with universally,

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:90%
as a way of meditation.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you do that,
letting go of your thoughts,

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:84%
opening up to the divine
source of everything.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the end of a
period of time-- 10 minutes

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
or 20 minutes-- you
take a little time

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the breath
through the word,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and then you integrate
that experience

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:84%
into your emotions
and your thoughts,

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:84%
maybe praying in
a different way,

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
visualizing what's going
to happen during your day,

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and then offering a
blessing from the period

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:90%
and moving into your day.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In many people's
lives, the pace is very fast,

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and especially in our
technology-loving society,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
the pace gets very, very fast.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:90%
You're always connected.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:90%
There's always things going on.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Business and home
life integrate a lot.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So it is-- I love
your idea of spending

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:90%
this time in the morning.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But what about carrying
it throughout your day?

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And when the busy mind happens,
and things don't work out

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
your way, and it just starts
kind of-- the cascade starts

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.235 align:middle line:90%
falling apart--

00:16:44.235 --> 00:16:44.943 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah.

00:16:44.943 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Then what?

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
How do you bring that into
that moment of stress?

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: That's
the real question.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So there is one
approach that helps

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.340 align:middle line:84%
to remain in this kind
of open-heartedness.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:90%
I call it heartfulness.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little like
grounding in the breath, being

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.669 align:middle line:84%
attentive to what's happening,
open to what I'm experiencing

00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
in my body, more
present to other people,

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and willing to turn to the
divine at any moment of time,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:90%
offer gratitude for what is.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's like an anchoring
in activity that's helpful.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But I still experience,
and I'm thrown sometimes

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:84%
by being stressed and
overwhelmed by things.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, so there
are other practices.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:84%
There's one practice that we
teach in the centering prayer

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
movement called the
welcoming prayer.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So when emotions get
strong, you know,

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
it's not just
about wanting to be

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:90%
mindful, or heartfully present.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
If emotions become
triggered, then there's

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
a way to turn to
God in the emotion.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The tradition of
Christian contemplation

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
says-- or some
teachers say-- that God

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is present in all things,
including every emotion.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So to welcome God
in the feeling,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to learn and practice how to
embrace God, say, in my anxiety

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.669 align:middle line:90%
or in my anger--

00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about anger, yeah?

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:90%
How do you embrace God?

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's really, truly
doing something wrong,

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:84%
how do you embrace
God in that anger?

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Well, again,
that takes practice.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So I would turn
within, take a breath,

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:90%
feel into the anger in my body.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the practice, learning
how to recognize and feel.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it may be
tightness in my throat.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, welcome--
actually kind of say

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.670 align:middle line:90%
that word, welcome God within.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:90%
And then, let go.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Let go into the moment.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And that takes, oh,
10 seconds, maybe.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But 10
years of practice.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:55.622 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:55.622 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.413 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Well, yeah,
some training is valuable.

00:18:58.413 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to kind
of practice and train

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:84%
with when I'm irritated, before
it builds into anger, before it

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:90%
builds into rage.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Once it builds into rage, I
kind of have to leave the room,

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:90%
but then come back.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Come back because, I think
like you're intimating,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:84%
there might be a very
valuable-- something

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%
important to engage in
that relationship with.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, once the anger
is embraced and found

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
in the life of God,
then it gives me

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more
energy and freedom

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:90%
to handle the situation.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's also
about speaking your truth.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you get to
that place of something's

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
going wrong and you need to say
something about it, from what

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I've studied in terms
of neurochemistry,

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.347 align:middle line:84%
there's certain
neurochemicals that

00:19:47.347 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:84%
release when you get
to that place of anger,

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.864 align:middle line:84%
that it's like your
brain on drugs.

00:19:50.864 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And you really can't-- you reach
the point of no return when you

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:90%
get to that place.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:84%
This contemplative movement,
this idea of centering prayer,

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
would help release
those neurotoxins,

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
those neurochemicals,
and get you

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.429 align:middle line:84%
back to the place of being
able to speak your voice.

00:20:06.429 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Yes, it does.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so to have the
energy transformed

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and the anger so that the
biochemicals are reduced

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
in the body, and then the
energy behind the emotion

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:90%
maybe is transformed.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's still about engaging
energy, but without the rage.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.316 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:20:30.316 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Toxicity.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just asking
you different ways

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring this into
life and different examples

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:90%
of how to bring this into life.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about
families and young families

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and young people moving away
from the organized religion

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and seeking something
else, where they can still

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
teach their kids morality,
and spirituality,

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and the essence of
God, but yet there's

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.150 align:middle line:90%
no house to do it in any longer?

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: It's such
an interesting time

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that we live in because some
of those institutions-- a lot

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
of Christian churches
are diminishing,

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and at the same
time, the internet

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:90%
is just changing everything.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And your work is a part of that.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can reach out to people
and provide resources to them.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas Keating
had no idea, really,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
how to reach out into the
world with his message

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:90%
of contemplative prayer.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But 35 years ago,
some of those people

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
from that retreat
and others began

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to help him with organizing
small groups oriented

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.440 align:middle line:84%
towards centering
prayer and the ability

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:84%
to live the contemplative
life in ordinary life.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are in
churches, those groups

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and meditation resources,
but some are not.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But I think you're really asking
a very important question.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in
the midst of it,

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's just happening
all around us.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Attendance is
down, and the media

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
has portrayed the
Catholic Church

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
as a place where there's a
lot of deceit and sinning.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that's
really all happening

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:90%
or if it's just the media.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.169 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
conspiracy theories

00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that
you could go after.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:84%
But we are losing our faith
as a population-- in the US,

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:84%
probably, I can just speak
for-- in these organized

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:90%
senses of religion.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So people are looking, seeking
for something that can still

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:84%
raise a family, help you
deal with life in a way that

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:84%
is moral, and honest,
and forgiving.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
How is what you do
different than meditation?

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE:
Meditation-- you mean

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.060 align:middle line:90%
like from Buddhism or Hinduism?

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.689 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:52.689 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Well, there
are a lot of similarities

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:84%
because both the
centering prayer

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and those great
meditative traditions

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:84%
emphasize practice and
emphasize coming out

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:84%
of a living tradition of
practitioners for many years,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and opening up to a mystery
that's not necessarily

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:84%
about dogma and belief
alone, but about experience

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and the transformation of the
structures of consciousness.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm trained in
psychology, so that's

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
like a unifying language now
between all the religions.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are similarities, and
there's a sense of difference,

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:84%
too, and uniqueness, I think,
to all the great traditions.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I guess if you
climb a mountain--

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and your question
is are those paths

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle line:90%
leading to the same place?

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So is the meditative
path of Buddhism

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
leading to the same
place on the mountain?

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Is the Christian contemplative
path leading to the same place?

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, within that metaphor,
I think, probably, they

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:90%
are leading to the same place.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.225 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they're different
routes up the mountain--

00:24:02.225 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To get there.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.154 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: To get there-- open
up a slightly different view,

00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're slightly different
paths and everything,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
but I trust that the
summit, or the depths,

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want
to use that kind

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:84%
of heightened, hierarchical
imagery, is the same.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So in centering prayer,
one of the differences

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
that's probably unique, if not
exclusive, to centering prayer

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.160 align:middle line:90%
is this idea of relationship.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So that practice with the sacred
breath or the sacred word,

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:90%
it's about intentionality.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:84%
In, say, mindfulness meditation
coming from Buddhism,

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
the practice is a
profound practice,

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps it's more about
attention and awareness.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
You're changing and transforming
your attention/awareness

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:90%
as you go up that mountaintop.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a huge
piece, especially when we're

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.310 align:middle line:84%
in this place of diffused
awareness and diffused

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.930 align:middle line:90%
attention.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:84%
To have a practice that
allows you to get back

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
to that place of centering
and attention/awareness

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is a great, great
idea-- helps lower

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:90%
stress and all sorts of things.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Could you give us an
example or take us

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
through a little bit
of a centering prayer?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's-- we just
have a short amount of time,

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.534 align:middle line:84%
but is that something
that you could do with us?

00:25:23.534 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Oh, to
offer some guidance?

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, right now.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Oh, sure.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That would be great.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Just
give me a sense.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Two minutes?

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Three minutes?

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:84%
That would be great
so that we could

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.800 align:middle line:84%
get the experience of
what you're talking about,

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
talking about it.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: That's a great idea.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I would love it.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: So a
comfortable posture,

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to
sit more upright,

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:90%
but without a sense of rigidity.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.564 align:middle line:90%
And I invite you into that.

00:25:47.564 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:90%
You look pretty comfortable.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm very comfortable.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm very supported,
and I love this space.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: And you
have a little cushion,

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.670 align:middle line:84%
so you're erect
without being rigid.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And the eyes closed--
let's take a breath.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And so just to prepare,
there are three segments

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:84%
to centering prayer-- the
initial, preparatory moment,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and then the body of
the practice, and then

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:90%
the conclusion.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So just prepare
by perhaps calling

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
to mind your own sense of the
divine, your own sense of who

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:90%
or what God is for you now.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And that could be God,
or it could be life.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It could be a mystery
that you're not sure of.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.865 align:middle line:90%
But just call that to mind.

00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And have a sense of
opening your mind and heart

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to the presence of the divine
as you know that to be.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And now, rather than
thinking about God,

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:84%
let a word come to you
of one or two syllables

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:84%
that expresses
your "yes" to God.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:90%
It could be yes.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:90%
It could be God.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.150 align:middle line:90%
It could be Shalom.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And let it come to you
as if it were floating up

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:84%
from the depths of
a deep pool of water

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:90%
to the surface of your mind.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, just
listen to that word

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:90%
as it prays itself in your mind.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.186 align:middle line:84%
That is, rather than trying
to grind away on the word,

00:27:50.186 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:90%
let the word be there.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.552 align:middle line:84%
Let it exist on the
stream of consciousness

00:27:58.552 --> 00:27:59.385 align:middle line:90%
with other thoughts.

00:27:59.385 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Ever so gently,
return to it when

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.035 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking about
another thought.

00:28:07.035 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And in this moment,
just be willing to let

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.010 align:middle line:84%
go of the word, the
form, and rest your mind

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and heart in openness.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you'll
begin thinking again.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Return to the word.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And because this is a quick
dose, let go of the word.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you move into
conclusion, just take a moment

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps offer
a prayer in words

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:84%
quietly within for
the suffering world,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
for someone or some
situation in life.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmm.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:90%
That was beautiful.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.086 align:middle line:90%
Can I share my experience?

00:29:03.086 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Yes, please do.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My word was thank you.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm always in that place of
deep gratitude for whatever's

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
going on in my life, and it's
always been my first prayer.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you said my mind
was wandering, of course

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:90%
it was wandering.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And I got back to-- and when
you said let go of the word

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and let it just be, that is
such a great metaphor for life.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Whatever things are happening
in life, they are happening.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, letting them be
and not pushing and resisting

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:84%
against them-- just
that practice of letting

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
it drop and float was a
beautiful metaphor for me

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: That's
a wonderful insight.

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:44.654 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was wonderful.

00:29:44.654 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah, because
contemplative prayer

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.292 align:middle line:90%
is like learning to float.

00:29:49.292 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah, where you
kind of are in the pool,

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're just trusting in
an unseen presence that's

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:90%
going to support you.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:90%
So you can let go of thoughts.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.520 align:middle line:90%
You can let go of the word.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's a support, to
thank and to offer that--

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.410 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately, it's
about just being.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Just being.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That state-- I'm sorry.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.580 align:middle line:90%
That state is-- yes, I did.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I tend to have the busy
mind, but that's what I do.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And that state was--
it was-- floating

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.520 align:middle line:84%
was a great word
for it because I

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:84%
seem to have lost
that grounding.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Even though I love
to be grounded,

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.900 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's nice to just
release from that grounding

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and reestablish
it in a new space.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Exactly.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.145 align:middle line:84%
So to be still-- to be still
and know that God is God,

00:30:38.145 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that this is life-- and then
that little portion at the end.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Again, that was a
real quick experience,

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.960 align:middle line:84%
but your awareness
just opened up

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.830 align:middle line:84%
to it-- of then ending
with the thank you--

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.600 align:middle line:84%
the form of the
thank you-- and then

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.210 align:middle line:84%
having a little time
to practice or pray.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you were really
doing the centering prayer,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
you would really develop
that so that you could then

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
integrate that ground,
that silent ground,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
into your thoughts
and emotions in life.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not like we want
to walk around being spacey.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But to have that freedom,
to have that experience--

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
a deepening experience
of inner freedom,

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and then integrate that freedom
into the movements of life--

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:84%
If you think about walking
around in your daily life,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:84%
you get hooked and corded by
various things, people, events,

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.400 align:middle line:90%
moments.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And throughout the
day, if you have

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:84%
a moment where you can
just release those cords,

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.600 align:middle line:90%
you get to restore your energy.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially
what that gives you

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.230 align:middle line:90%
the opportunity to do.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.585 align:middle line:84%
So a question about
the end-- so I

00:31:39.585 --> 00:31:41.460 align:middle line:84%
don't know if this is
my Catholic upbringing,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.200 align:middle line:84%
but I tend to ask for things
for myself-- sometimes

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.430 align:middle line:84%
health, healing, whatever's
going on in my life

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.120 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I extend that to my family.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I forget to
extend it beyond to the world

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:84%
because I don't feel-- there's
a certain-- I want more

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:02.070 align:middle line:84%
of a focus, and it
seems so broad to me.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:07.530 align:middle line:84%
How do I take that broadness
of world peace and pray

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:84%
for something that
seems so ambiguous?

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I guess my mental
monkey mind wants

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:90%
to grab on to the solution.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.230 align:middle line:90%
It does, yeah.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Well, one thing
that might be helpful, or see

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:84%
what this is like-- have the
attitude of that silent-- that

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:84%
period of gratitude, like
the centering prayer.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.490 align:middle line:84%
We're really uniting
ourselves with everybody

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:90%
at the depths of existence.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a prayer for
everyone when we do that.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same
time, sometimes it's

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.100 align:middle line:84%
valuable at the end to
remember particular needs.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But if your heart opens
to your family, you know,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:90%
that's what's relevant.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.103 align:middle line:90%
That's what's here.

00:32:54.103 --> 00:32:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.262 align:middle line:90%
So not judging myself about it.

00:32:56.262 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah, I
think it's beautiful.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.595 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think this
could go on and on

00:32:59.595 --> 00:33:03.060 align:middle line:84%
about letting go of judgment,
letting go of self-judgment.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you--
so when you're

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.770 align:middle line:84%
teaching this, what are
the questions that come up

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:90%
from people?

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.660 align:middle line:84%
What are the biggest questions
that arise in your classes?

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: It
depends on the class.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.720 align:middle line:84%
If it's an introductory
class, it's

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.600 align:middle line:84%
usually about how
to do the practice.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you asked a
question a few minutes ago,

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:84%
which is more representative
of an advanced question.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I think you asked
something about how would I

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
counsel someone with trauma
or psychological issues.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: So taking
that up a little bit,

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.150 align:middle line:90%
catching that question again.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.375 align:middle line:84%
The centering prayer and some
of those auxiliary practices

00:33:40.375 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned are great
helps for being in the world.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But as a trained
psychotherapist,

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't recommend
them as being

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:55.150 align:middle line:84%
exclusive of other forms
of assistance-- body work,

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:84%
therapy, good
support, being rooted

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:84%
with good medical-- alternative
medicine and regular medicine.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, people come
into a meditation class

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.502 align:middle line:84%
or they get into a
practice of meditation,

00:34:07.502 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and they think,
well, this is going

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:90%
to be my answer for everything.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think actually, honestly,
it's the most profound answer,

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:84%
to touch into what
we're talking about.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But to live that
out in the world,

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I recommend taking advantage
of the supports that

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:90%
have been developed.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:31.210 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
spiritual bypassing,

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.900 align:middle line:84%
this attitude that if I'm a
real spiritual practitioner,

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I can bypass everything else,
rather than take advantage,

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and listen, and
learn from what I

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:44.330 align:middle line:84%
need to have in my life,
especially support.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Our society is kind of isolated.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:90%
We lose connection with people.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and
in a sense, develop

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.050 align:middle line:84%
some type of a spiritual
ignorance of what else

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.705 align:middle line:84%
is around, what is going on,
and-- a disconnection that way.

00:34:57.705 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm all about
bridging that gap.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.870 align:middle line:84%
That's, I think, one of
the main-- my main passions

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:08.580 align:middle line:84%
is bridging the gap of
deeply profound practices

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to the practical daily
life of ordinary people

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:84%
who go through stressors in
life, and it hooks you in.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:18.846 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: That's it.

00:35:18.846 --> 00:35:20.647 align:middle line:90%
That's part of our reality.

00:35:20.647 --> 00:35:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Respond to it.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:22.681 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:35:22.681 --> 00:35:23.730 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our reality.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.855 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: And that's--
your point about religion.

00:35:25.855 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I think religion, then, needs
to respond to people's life

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.740 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a bit
disconnected because it's

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:90%
held on to the tradition.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And I understand the tradition,
and it's deep, and it's rooted.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's got to be a way
for the tradition to exist

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time to make
it practical to modern life.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is a nice balance.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a nice kind of
stepping stone on that path.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.921 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah, I think
it's one helpful contribution

00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:53.420 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.315 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's the
challenge for religion

00:35:56.315 --> 00:35:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and religious institutions,
and all of society.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.120 align:middle line:84%
We're in this evolving
world, and what's

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
the relevance from the past
that needs to be updated?

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:84%
That was the
original inspiration

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:84%
for centering prayer, to bring
forth this contemplative wisdom

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
out of the monasteries
so it could

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.290 align:middle line:90%
be relevant to people's lives.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I
love the mission.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- this is
just my personal opinion,

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.550 align:middle line:90%
but going back to the trauma.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:26.250 align:middle line:84%
In this day and age,
when things move so fast,

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.750 align:middle line:84%
little events happen
in our daily lives

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:32.100 align:middle line:84%
that are traumatic, that
do get stored in the body.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.300 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to be major
life-changing traumas.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It could be a bad
rapport with somebody,

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.630 align:middle line:84%
exchanged words
that are hurtful.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:84%
It could be-- those little
things register in our bodies

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.950 align:middle line:90%
as traumas during the day.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.610 align:middle line:84%
We stack them up at
night, go to sleep,

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:90%
and start all over the next day.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.470 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be a way
to be able to release

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:00.560 align:middle line:84%
those mini-- mini crises
throughout your day,

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and this is a good
way to do that.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: It's a good way
to help with that process.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.390 align:middle line:84%
My abba, Thomas Keating,
he has this image

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that the divine, God,
in this relationship

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:90%
is a divine psychotherapist--

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's great.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: --who is
helping to heal that.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:84%
But again, I think that some
of the traumas and the pace--

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.700 align:middle line:84%
just as you're saying,
the pace of life--

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.836 align:middle line:90%
is inherently traumatic for us.

00:37:28.836 --> 00:37:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It definitely
has those-- yeah,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.464 align:middle line:90%
those days happen.

00:37:31.464 --> 00:37:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: That we need a
lot of other things, too.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think I want
to go back to your point

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.390 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning
about listening,

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.050 align:middle line:84%
about that inner
psychotherapist.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I love that concept of asking
the divine, or whatever

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:84%
it is that your presence
is, what can I do?

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:90%
What is the solution?

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:90%
How can I heal?

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.950 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:52.640 align:middle line:84%
What is the-- that is not
in my current awareness?

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.454 align:middle line:84%
What can-- and then,
just to listen.

00:37:54.454 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: To listen, yeah.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
usually always there.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.901 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
comes from our own minds

00:37:59.901 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:84%
or if it really does
come from the divine.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.366 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:38:03.366 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: I think it
comes from the divine,

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
but of course, it's filtered
through our own minds.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So I like this image that
you're kind of describing--

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:84%
to ask, and then to listen,
and to ask again, and listen.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it is a
living relationship.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.604 align:middle line:84%
And then, we get more in touch
with the divine, I think.

00:38:21.604 --> 00:38:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there any
other profound teachings

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that you want to share with us
from your journey with Thomas

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.689 align:middle line:84%
Keating or your entire
journey with the movement?

00:38:30.689 --> 00:38:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: I think
I would just like

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to emphasize for myself
and for the people

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.995 align:middle line:84%
that I know and
work with that it

00:38:39.995 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:84%
is a journey into being
more and more human.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.730 align:middle line:84%
This is this traditional
teaching in Christianity

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that, through this
contemplative process,

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:84%
one is divinized, meaning that
the life of God awakens and one

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.320 align:middle line:90%
becomes divinized.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.942 align:middle line:84%
But I also think, for me, it's
becoming more and more human.

00:39:00.942 --> 00:39:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great point.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah,
so-- just who I am.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great point.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for
enlightening me and sharing

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:13.376 align:middle line:90%
with me with your whole process.

00:39:13.376 --> 00:39:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't look at my
notes at all because they

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.200 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with
what we just talked about.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.158 align:middle line:90%
>>FRENETTE: Yeah, Lisa.

00:39:18.158 --> 00:39:19.375 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:19.375 --> 00:39:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.347 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.
