>>LISA GARR: What
is consciousness?

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it located in the
center of our brain,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
or is it non-local and outside
of our brains in some type

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:90%
of immeasurable field?

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Can it be shared?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.246 align:middle line:90%
Can it be tested?

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:84%
These are the questions
that scientists

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
have debated about for hundreds,
maybe even thousands of years.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is Dr.
Eben Alexander.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:10%
He is a New York
Times bestselling

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:10%
author of "Proof of Heaven,"
"The Map of Heaven,"

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:10%
and he shares his
unique insights

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:10%
into the true nature
of consciousness

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:10%
based on his experience
as a neurosurgeon

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:10%
and surviving a life-threatening
illness and a subsequent coma.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:10%
Welcome.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining me.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:10%
>>EBEN ALEXANDER: Well,
Lisa, it's great to be here.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So many
incredible stories

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:10%
that you have shared with me
before on the Gaia shows here.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:84%
But I want to hear just a
little bit about your story

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:90%
of your experience in the coma.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how
did you get there?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, I had spent
54 years of my life honing

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:90%
a scientific worldview.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I was a neurosurgeon, teaching
at Harvard Medical School.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And then on November 10,
2008, 4:30 in the morning,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
developed severe back
pain, severe headache,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:84%
soon thereafter seizures,
was driven deep into coma.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that my
doctors who accepted me

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
into the emergency room
figured out very quickly

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that I had a
life-threatening case

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:84%
of bacterial meningoencephalitis
or very profound meningitis,

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
involving the
depths of the brain.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:10%
And so in fact, the
interesting thing

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.530 align:middle line:10%
is that my entire scientific
worldview for coma

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:10%
would predict that
somebody that ill,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:10%
especially with the
documented evidence

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:10%
to damage to my neocortex,
should have had no experience

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:10%
whatsoever.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:10%
And yet, what had unfolded over
the next seven days of my coma

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:10%
was a profound spiritual
journey into ultra-real realms,

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:10%
far more real than this one,
that I came back to the world

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:10%
trying to explain,
initially thinking

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:10%
it had to have been
a vast hallucination.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But then the more I
learned about my illness,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and as my brain recovered--
because when I first came back

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
from coma, my brain
was so wrecked

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even recognize
loved ones at the bedside.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't have
even survived that.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, the
doctors had predicted

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I had a 10% chance of
survival early in the week

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
but was down to a 2%
chance of survival

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the week, but
with no chance of recovery.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And any physician who
reviews these medical records

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
realizes this was a devastating
case of bacterial meningitis.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:84%
My doctors to this
day would tell you

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that the biggest miracle
is that I survived

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:90%
and had a complete recovery.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that pretty
much is unprecedented.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
To me, the miracle concerns
what I witnessed deep in coma

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
when my doctors
had evidence based

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
on my neurologic exams,
my scans and lab values,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
that the human part
of my brain was not

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
capable of producing
any hallucination, drug

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
effect, confabulation,
hallucination, what have you.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I've spent
the last 10 years of my life

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:90%
as a scientist investigating.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as a
scientist beforehand,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:90%
you were in people's brains.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
You were inside as a
neurosurgeon operating

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%
in their brains.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever put together
afterwards, years later,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that this would be an
experience that you

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:90%
would have gone through?

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And going through the inner
workings of the brain,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:90%
what could have happened to you?

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.766 align:middle line:84%
Meningitis attacking
the neocortex--

00:03:58.766 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: It's perfect.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Devastating.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: But it was perfect.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:90%
It was a gift.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why do you say--

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: I mean,
what I've learned

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
is that near-death
experiences are always

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
very crucial to the soul
that's undergoing it.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:90%
That's why they exist.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, scientists who study
near-death experiences

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:84%
by the thousands will
tell you that there

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:90%
are many commonalities.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the commonalities
point to this

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:90%
being a very real realm.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Just because it's
not a material realm

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean it's
not absolutely real.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet the stories are
always a little bit different

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:84%
because they are tailored
to the individual.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And in looking back
on it, especially

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
with 10 years of study,
of consciousness,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:84%
between that coma
and now, I realized

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that it was really a
perfect journey for me,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
as someone who was
very open-minded

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
as a neuroscientist, needing to
know much more about the nature

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Up until my coma,
I believed fully

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
the conventional
scientific model

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
of what's known as physicalism,
or reductive materialism.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the idea that
only the physical world exists.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So if we study that
physical world or material

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
world as closely as we can, we
can determine how it all works.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And that includes, of
course, the supposition

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
that if only the
physical exists and we

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
know there's a relationship
between brain and mind or brain

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, that
somehow the brain must

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:90%
be creating consciousness.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
that is not true.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is where our modern
science is so befuddled.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
That's where neuroscience has
actually reached an impasse

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:90%
and so has quantum physics.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.899 align:middle line:84%
The deep study of the
nature of matter around us.

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's because quantum
physics gets right

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.220 align:middle line:84%
into the heart of the
mind-brain connection.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But there's a revolution going
on in the scientific world

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
today about exactly
that, about all

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
of the evidence in neuroscience
and philosophy of mind,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is not the
creator of consciousness

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
at all, that it's more of
a filter or reducing valve,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
but that consciousness
is primordial.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.524 align:middle line:10%
So, in fact, we're conscious
in spite of the brain.

00:06:07.524 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that we come

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
to know very fully
when we die, when

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
the physical brain and
body come to an end

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.502 align:middle line:84%
and we realize our conscious
awareness doesn't disappear

00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:84%
into nothingness, which is what
the materialist model would

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.537 align:middle line:84%
put out, but in fact is
expanded tremendously.

00:06:22.537 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
near-death experiences

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
have been telling us
for thousands of years,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:84%
across all continents
and belief systems.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is so interesting.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
How many people come
up to you and say,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:90%
that happened to me too?

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Oh, I would
say it happens a lot.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing
is, I often still give talks

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:90%
to very naive audiences.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:84%
They've never heard of
NDEs, but they show up

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:90%
at these presentations I give.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that's so
fascinating is afterwards,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.714 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a certain group of
people come up to me and say--

00:06:51.714 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and often they'll
start by saying,

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I never told anybody
this before but.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And often in that
setting they'll

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:84%
share a near-death
experience, very profound,

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that might have happened
50 or 60 years earlier,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and yet they remember
it as clearly

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:90%
as if it happened yesterday.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.814 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: These are not
imaginary or hallucinatory.

00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
There have been
scientific studies

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
on the nature of
memories of NDEs,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're far more
profound and resilient

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and stable as memories
than pretty much the memory

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
of anything else that
ever happens in our life.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.335 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very
stable and rich.

00:07:25.335 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Delible.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: And people often say
they're too real to be real.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Those were the words I used
to my oldest son, Eben IV.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
When I was out of the
hospital two days,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
he came home for
Thanksgiving back in 2008

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.457 align:middle line:90%
and gave me a big hug.

00:07:40.457 --> 00:07:42.039 align:middle line:84%
And he told me later
it was like there

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
was a light shining within
me, like I was far more

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:90%
present than I had ever been.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it was way too
real to be real, which to me

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
at that time meant it had
to be a vast hallucination.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.824 align:middle line:84%
But I still was
recovering all my memory

00:07:54.824 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
of neuroscience and
everything that took

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.115 align:middle line:90%
two months to come back to me.

00:07:58.115 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And also because
you don't remember it--

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of the
biggest challenges is,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't remember
mine until I started--

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing Raymond
Moody, and I did research.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I saw these characteristics
of indelible memory

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and as if it just happened
yesterday and immediate recall.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And it changes
your life purpose.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a big characteristic,
and your life purpose completely

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.672 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:08:21.672 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Here we see
things with our eyes,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:90%
we hear with our ears.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
In those realms,
you see everything.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.710 align:middle line:84%
By identity, you become one with
other beings, other souls that

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.359 align:middle line:84%
are on this journey as your way
of knowing and understanding

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's often said that these
experiences are ineffable.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:90%
They're indescribable.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
You cannot use human language to
fully express them because they

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:90%
are so extraordinary.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
we talk about in our book

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:84%
"Living in a Mindful Universe,"
because it's really all about--

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:84%
the fact is, you don't have
to be smote down by meningitis

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:84%
to know everything
I know about this.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
As a conscious,
sentient being, going

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:84%
within a practice of
centering prayer or meditation

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:84%
can be a very powerful
tool to coming

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:84%
to know the eternity
of your soul

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
long before you leave
the physical body.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It really makes
you think about memory.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So you write about in the book--
and this is the scientific part

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.505 align:middle line:90%
of this--

00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
when I was very young, I asked
my dad who is a scientist,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
where is memory
located in the brain?

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to
know your answer.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, the
interesting answer

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:84%
is it is not localized
in the brain.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, a lot of the
evidence that I now put out

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that we discuss in "Living
in a Mindful Universe"

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:90%
has to do with reincarnation.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.307 align:middle line:84%
Now, although most materialist
scientists will say, well, wait

00:09:45.307 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
a minute, brain
creates consciousness,

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:90%
so you can't have reincarnation.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:84%
There's no way for any sense
of memory to go from one life

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, that is not true.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:84%
The scientific evidence out
of University of Virginia,

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:84%
work over more
than five decades,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:84%
beginning with Dr. Ian
Stevenson, a very respected

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:84%
psychiatrist, who studied past
life memories in children,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that he fully expected to
basically debunk or explain

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.175 align:middle line:84%
as a typical
materialist scientist.

00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But then he found there
are these cases where

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't do that.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It wasn't imagination?

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: It was not imagination.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And they would track
these cases down.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:84%
They'd pay attention
to children,

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.710 align:middle line:84%
because children are much
less likely to be influenced

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and have other
sources of information

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that they could try and
use to deceive people.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And so-- in the
UVA database, they

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
have more than 2,700 cases
of past life memories

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
in children, where the
best explanation is really

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:90%
of reincarnation.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is most
striking about their database

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:84%
is that 35% of those
2,700 cases, the child

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
has a birthmark that
corresponds to the mortal wound

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:90%
of the prior life.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is a mind
bender, when you

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:90%
understand the implications.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ian Stevenson
started that work,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.019 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jim Tucker, a very
respected child psychiatrist

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:90%
is carrying on that work.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:84%
He's the current
head of division

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:90%
of perceptual studies at UVA.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But once you start
realizing that all

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that reincarnation information
is real and scientifically

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
validated, it
becomes quite obvious

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that you shouldn't be looking
for memory in the brain.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.821 align:middle line:84%
Neurosurgeons had
suspected for a long time

00:11:23.821 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:84%
that memories are not
stored in the brain.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is,
even though you

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:84%
can damage the medial
temporal lobes,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that seems to interfere with
the conversion of short-term

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:90%
to long-term memories.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
That's something that was
known by neurosurgeons back

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:90%
in the early 1950s.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But in all the brain resections
we've done of the neocortex

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
by the millions over
the last century or so,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:84%
never has there been an
identifiable case of removal

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of certain long-term memories.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:90%
That never happens.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Wilder Penfield, one of the
most respected neurosurgeons

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century who
worked out of Montreal,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called "Mystery
of the Mind" in 1975.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And he is probably in a better
position than just about

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
anybody on Earth, because
he electrically stimulated

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:84%
the brain in awake patients for
hundreds and hundreds of cases.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And mapping out the relationship
between the brain stimulation

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and the phenomena
experienced by the mind.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And this book, "Mystery of
the Mind" makes it very clear,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
you will not find the
mind in the brain.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:90%
It's too big.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:90%
There's too much going on.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
You cannot explain it by
the workings of the brain.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
He made it clear that
free will does not

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:90%
exist in the brain itself.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Free will exists in
that higher realm

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and memory that
influences every bit of this.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when this person, the
people, the subjects are awake

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and they were able
to explain memories,

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
he did not see those synapses
happening in the brain?

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.897 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, what he found,
it's actually very complex.

00:12:53.897 --> 00:12:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And I go into some of that
in "Living in a Mindful

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Universe," including the
first appendix in that book,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:84%
because it's fairly
complicated information.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he only
found that stimulation

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
over abnormal regions
of temporal lobe

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
would create any kind of
phenomenal experience.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't, for example,
parietal lobes,

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:84%
where we think most
of sensory and what's

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:84%
called association cortex,
where we put together

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:90%
a model of the world--

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.885 align:middle line:84%
well, you can stimulate
parietal lobe all day long,

00:13:19.885 --> 00:13:21.499 align:middle line:84%
and do not get those
kind of memories.

00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:84%
You only get them
over temporal lobe,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.039 align:middle line:90%
and only in abnormal regions.

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:26.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't get them
in normal regions.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are
abnormal regions?

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Meaning a part
that was, say, part

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
of the epileptic focus,
a place where somebody

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
had had a stroke
or a head trauma

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
or some damaged
area of the brain.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the only setting in
which he uncovered that.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, initially he thought he was
hot on the trail of uncovering

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
memory, because some of
those electrical stimulations

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:90%
would trigger remote memories.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out
he came to realize

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
that even if he took that
part of the brain out,

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:90%
he didn't get rid of the memory.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
The patient could still
access the memory.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it
was way too simplistic

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:84%
a model that memory would
be stored in the brain.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And modern neurosurgical
research supports all that.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I did more than 100
such cases myself,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:84%
awake craniotomy
stimulating of the neocortex

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to map out usually
speech or motor

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.240 align:middle line:84%
areas, which can best be mapped
out in the awake patient.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, since the
brain feels no pain at all,

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
all you have to
do is anesthetize

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:84%
the scalp with local anesthesia
and sedate the patient.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:10%
But then you can open
the skull and have

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:10%
this huge open craniotomy
with the brain fully exposed,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:10%
and you can electrically
stimulate and have the patient

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.905 align:middle line:10%
awake and talking with you.

00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: They're
amazing experiences,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:90%
and I love doing those cases.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.849 align:middle line:90%
They're very instructive.

00:14:38.849 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you do that
before or after your NDE?

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: That was
all before my NDE.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So you were always
really curious as a soul.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: I was very curious.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to know some answers.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't realize
how deep the mystery

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:90%
was until my coma experience.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the only
way you could have ever

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:84%
gotten the answer was to go
through what you went through.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.898 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: Well, I had to.

00:14:55.898 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And it caused me to
question everything

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd ever thought I knew about
any part of the universe.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And that really is the
truth, is we have to go back

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:90%
and question everything.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Because many of our
foundational beliefs,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:84%
including the primary assumption
of materialist science,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the physical world
is the only thing that exists,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and therefore if you
understand that physical world,

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:84%
you can understand
everything else.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:90%
And that is false.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
There's far more to this.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the odd irony of
it all is the physical world

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:90%
is the part that doesn't exist.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:84%
There's old talk
about what's called

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:90%
the ghost in the machine.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And the scientist
in me before coma

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
would have told you,
well, any discussion

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
of the ghost in the
machine, there is no ghost.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.176 align:middle line:84%
There's only the machine,
the physical brain.

00:15:45.176 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
been dead wrong.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is where not
only modern neuroscience

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy of mind are
going, but also quantum

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
physics and interpretation
of the measurement paradox.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
They are converging
on this notion

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
fundamental in the universe.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
revolution that is coming

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:84%
to the scientific world
today, is the realization

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
that the thing that
exists is the ghost.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:84%
The machine is an
illusion created by mind.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is where it all
gets extremely fascinating.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you and
I are sitting here

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.677 align:middle line:84%
and we're both observing
chairs and a rug and a table,

00:16:22.677 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
does that mean that the chairs
and the rug and the table

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:84%
only exist because you
and I are observing them?

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.775 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: Correct.

00:16:28.775 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about the
viewers observing them?

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.615 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, the
viewers are all at

00:16:32.615 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:90%
ease of conscious awareness.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
We're actually-- I
think the best way

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
to look at it is we
are sharing one mind.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:90%
We are all sharing one mind.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a group agreement.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: And it's really
kind of astonishing.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The fathers of quantum physics
saw this quite clearly.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Erwin Schrodinger, for example,
wrote a whole book on mind

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of
one consciousness.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And one of my colleagues
and good friends

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
in this effort,
Dr. Larry Dossey,

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
wrote a beautiful
book called "The One

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
Mind," which is
absolutely about this,

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:90%
how we are sharing one mind.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And it is pointed out through
things like telepathy.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And he started his
interest because he

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.200 align:middle line:90%
has an identical twin brother.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And people who know
about twins realize

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes, for example,
a twin can burn their finger

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
on a stove and their fellow
twin could be 1,000 miles away,

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
but they're the one who
developed the blister.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So you get these very strange
telepathic experiences

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:84%
of shared mental
experience between twins.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out they
also exist between others.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Couples, romantic relationship,
parents and children,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle line:84%
can have very profound
telepathic communication.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
My birth mother had a
profound knowing the night

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:90%
that I went into coma.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And she had just gotten
back from a long vacation.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
She had no way of knowing
it, but she was all alarmed

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:90%
that something had happened.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.901 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up calling my
former spouse, what's going on?

00:18:02.901 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's when she
heard that I had

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.030 align:middle line:84%
gone into a deep coma that day
due to a profound bacterial

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:90%
meningitis.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:90%
And she knew it.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
connections with others.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And so really mind is
far more than matter.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, we do.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.014 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: And that can be
explained by the workings

00:18:20.014 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:90%
of the physical brain.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the modern study

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
of neuroscience and
consciousness and philosophy

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.520 align:middle line:84%
of mind is so absolutely
amazing, because of what

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:84%
it shows about human potential
about our interconnectedness,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:84%
how we're all really
in this together.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.339 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's important
to treat each other as we

00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:90%
would like to be treated.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And that we can also connect
with each other so easily.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look here
at Dr. Eben Alexander talking

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
about the difference between
consciousness and the brain.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: When we have to realize
that no human being has ever

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:84%
witnessed anything
other than the inside

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:90%
of their own consciousness.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
It's something that my
co-author, Karen Newell, and I

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
call the supreme illusion.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is that everything
that is out there in the world,

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
when I have people
and have other--

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
you know, the trees, the birds,
the sky, the beautiful stars

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and galaxies in the
night sky, all of that,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
are our brain and
mind convinced us,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:90%
we're witnessing the out there.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But what we actually experience
is an internal construct.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot stress enough
the importance of realizing

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:84%
the power and seduction
of that supreme illusion.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And to actually get
deeper to truth,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
we have to kind of go
through that illusion.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of why
meditation is so important,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:90%
going into consciousness.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And really, you cannot think
your way to knowingness.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:84%
You cannot just read the
books and just watch the DVDs

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and just go to the meetings.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:84%
The only way to actually
get it is to go within.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, is why
Karen Newell and I will often

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:84%
give these play shops,
as we call them,

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:90%
using sacred acoustics tones.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
The power differential
frequency sound to liberate

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:84%
conscious awareness from the
illusion of the here and now

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
is very powerful.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So in this, you say that we
witness this supreme illusion.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean by
that, supreme illusion?

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, the supreme
illusion is just pointing out

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:84%
the fact-- and it
is actually a fact,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not even kind
of a debatable issue.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is that when I am
sitting here experiencing

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:84%
this and having this discussion
with you, just as when I go out

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
at night and look up at
the night stars and all

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful universe we
live in, what I'm experiencing

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:90%
is a model within mind.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:10%
Never, ever lose sight of that.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that
our brain and mind

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:10%
are very clever at convincing
us that what we're experiencing

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:10%
is out there.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But never has that
been the case.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It has always been that you
were experiencing a mental model

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
that we think has some fidelity
with what's going on out there.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet that's where there
are a number of different kind

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
of types of
hallucinations, experiments

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:84%
you can do in psychology, to
show how much our mind fills

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:84%
in the blanks and kind
of puts in these gaps

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:90%
to kind of give us this reality.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's based on some
sensory information.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, when you get
into quantum physics, what

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:84%
you come to realize with
the deepest study of quantum

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:90%
physics--

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that
was hinted at by the founding

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.205 align:middle line:84%
fathers, like Schrodinger
and Wolfgang Pauli, John von

00:21:42.205 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Neumann, Eugene
Wigner, and others.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And Erwin Schrodinger,
as I mentioned earlier--

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The cat.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Exactly,
Schrodinger and his cat--

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:84%
they realized that
mind was fundamental,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.357 align:middle line:84%
that you cannot pretend that
somehow consciousness is

00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:84%
created by the physical
matter of the brain.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:90%
There's too much else going on.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Entanglement of
subatomic particles

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.920 align:middle line:84%
is a great indicator of
the connection across space

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and time of our knowledge
of this universe

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and how the mental model is
what is putting it all together.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the result of
all these machinations out

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:84%
in a physical world
that is simply being

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:90%
observed by a physical brain.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
The mind is actually
running the whole show.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about pain?

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.645 align:middle line:90%
Is pain something we make up?

00:22:27.645 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Pain is one of the
most beautiful examples

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
of how, how would you possibly
put together a material system

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.860 align:middle line:84%
like the brain to make
it give you this thing

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that we call pain that leads
to such behavioral changes?

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Pain is one of those things
that has no easy explanation

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever within the "brain
creates consciousness" model.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet with a broader
view, it starts

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:84%
to make more sense
of how pain works.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just pain
in a physical sense,

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
but also the kind of
emotional pain and suffering

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that comes with a lot
of our experiences

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
in life, like loss of
love and things like that.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of that that
is very richly explained

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
by understanding the mental
nature of the universe

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and of our very existence that
goes far beyond anything that

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:84%
can be explained by
the physics, chemistry,

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and biology of
subatomic particles

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that
are interacting.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:90%
There's much more going on here.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
think this revolution

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:84%
in scientific understanding
of the mind-brain relationship

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
is so absolutely crucial and
important to this world today.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Materialist science gives
us this false notion

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
of separation, as if
we can do whatever

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:84%
we want to others, because
we're separate from them.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
as I said earlier,

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.570 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics and
neuroscience of consciousness

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
are both leading to
the inevitable reality

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:90%
that we're sharing one mind.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of this universe is
emerging from that one mind.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the life review that
is so common in near-death

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:84%
experiences-- it's been
described going back at least

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
2,400 years across all
cultures and belief systems--

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that life review is
a beautiful example

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:84%
of how we're sharing one
mind because in your life

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't experience
things as yourself.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.000 align:middle line:84%
You experience as those who
are affected by your choices

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:90%
and actions around you.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.769 align:middle line:84%
And it's the evidence that the
golden rule, do unto others

00:24:26.769 --> 00:24:28.310 align:middle line:84%
as you would have
done unto yourself,

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is written into the very
fabric of the universe.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, we reap what we sow.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.334 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be careful
how we treat others.

00:24:34.334 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk about
that observer for a second.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
You write about this in
"A Mindful Universe."

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:10%
That observer, what does it
have to do with mindfulness?

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, very
important to point out.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Many of us would say our
mind and our consciousness

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.872 align:middle line:84%
is that little stream of
consciousness in our head.

00:24:48.872 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's that little
running narrative.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a
voice in their head.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It seems so small.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: Well, it is.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's the voice of your ego.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, it also happens
to be the voice

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of rational, logical
discussion between human beings

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:90%
about ideas.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:84%
But in essence,
don't start thinking

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:90%
that is your consciousness.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:90%
The voice in your head--

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I love how Michael Singer puts
it in his book, "The Untethered

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Soul," he calls that voice
the annoying roommate.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
important concept.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And Karen and I often get
into that in our meditation

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
workshops that we discuss in
"Living in a Mindful Universe,"

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:84%
because what we're talking
about is the observer.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the part of
consciousness that

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
is so absolutely
mind-bending in every way

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to the scientific world in
trying to understand how it can

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:90%
work, is that observer self.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So your consciousness is
aware of that little voice.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And in meditation, the
very first thing I do

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:84%
is I let that little voice maybe
state an intention or a quest

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of meditation.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.632 align:middle line:90%
But then it goes into timeout.

00:25:46.632 --> 00:25:47.715 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You give it a job.

00:25:47.715 --> 00:25:49.423 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Because you're
not going to think

00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:90%
your way to the answers.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Our cognitive structures
are useful to some degree.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But there's a tremendous
amount of knowledge

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:84%
that is not just dependent
on thinking your way there.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's where developing a
relationship with that observer

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
with that connection
to higher soul,

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that observer is the same
part that expands tremendously

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
in a near-death experience when
your conscious awareness is

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.907 align:middle line:84%
freed from the shackles
of the physical brain.

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
near-death experiences

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.980 align:middle line:84%
have been trying to tell
us for thousands of years.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:84%
That great expansion of
awareness, encountering souls

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.860 align:middle line:84%
of departed loved ones,
that expansive sense

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:84%
of that loving deity at
the core of all reality,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that God force that is so
beyond any kind of naming

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:84%
or description, that's
the beauty of what

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences
bring back to the world.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.890 align:middle line:84%
But again, you don't have to
die or almost die to know this.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, centering prayer,
all of us as sentient beings,

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
can come to know these
truths by exploring

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.790 align:middle line:84%
within our own consciousness,
which happens to be exploring

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.264 align:middle line:90%
out into that primordial mind.

00:26:52.264 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I get asked
that question a lot.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.390 align:middle line:84%
How do I have these experiences
without having to almost die?

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
incredible organizations now

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:04.140 align:middle line:84%
where they allow you to
have out-of-body experiences

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and transition you back in a
very safe, professional way.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:84%
There are shared
death experiences.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.860 align:middle line:90%
There are shared crossings.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:84%
The research is incredible
now, where you can actually

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.860 align:middle line:84%
go into the death
experience with a loved one

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and then assist then into
the afterworld, which

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:84%
is the evidence of the stream
of consciousness never dying.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is some of
the most important ways

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to live your life, is knowing
consciousness never dies.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: It's very crucial.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, of interest, there
is a very elaborate system

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:84%
of what I call
programmed forgetting.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when
children, for example,

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
when Jim Tucker and others who
investigate past-life memories

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and children suggestive
of reincarnation,

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:84%
they realize that you need to
talk to children between ages 2

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and 6, because that's when you
can harvest those memories.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:84%
As children age, there
are natural processes

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that are part of this
programmed forgetting,

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't remember
those things as an adult.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not entirely
true because the whole world

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of transpersonal
psychology, which

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:84%
has grown up over the
last three decades

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.760 align:middle line:84%
under the guidance of brilliant
investigators like Dr. Stan

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Grof Dr. Brian Weiss,
Dr. Michael Newton--

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:84%
they've done incredible
work to help us realize that

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
through hypnosis and
meditative techniques

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.420 align:middle line:84%
that you can recover
past-life memories.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'd say
the greatest value

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:84%
of the transpersonal
psychology world,

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:84%
combined with the
research supporting

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
the scientific reality
of reincarnation,

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:84%
is that it shows that
so many of the things

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:90%
that we face in this life--

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:84%
illness, injury, the
hardships and difficulties--

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.980 align:middle line:84%
are actually something that our
higher souls and soul groups

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.117 align:middle line:90%
selected for this lifetime.

00:28:58.117 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, most
people when you're

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.658 align:middle line:84%
going through one of
those horrible hardships--

00:29:01.658 --> 00:29:04.410 align:middle line:84%
like when I was going through my
meningitis, when my family was

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:84%
going through that, it's very
hard to see it as a blessing.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet, often the way these
turn out, the lessons learned,

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.420 align:middle line:84%
are tremendous in
guiding our soul growth

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of our
relationship with the universe.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The programmed forgetting
is important, though.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why the veiling function
of the brain is as it is--

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have such
ready access to that.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
If we came into these
lifetimes knowing fully

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
every bit of what our higher
souls know between lives

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
in planning these
incarnations, we

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.172 align:middle line:90%
would kind of cheat the system.

00:29:37.172 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The experience.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Because
that's what gives us

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
skin in the game, the emotional
power, feeling the love,

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.480 align:middle line:84%
but also feeling the pain of the
loss, when we lose a loved one,

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:84%
a terminal diagnosis, all
these things that get so much

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:90%
angst in our soul.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.809 align:middle line:84%
But that's why meditation,
centering prayer,

00:29:55.809 --> 00:29:57.350 align:middle line:84%
are beautiful gifts
because they help

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:84%
to give us that
much bigger view,

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.500 align:middle line:84%
to gain the bigger lessons
that our soul is here to learn.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So 2 to 6 makes
sense, because that is really

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:90%
such a pure state.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And what happens to
the brain after that?

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Why does the teenage
brain get this amnesia

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
of who they are until
we get to be adults

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:90%
with our sense of purpose?

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, as I said earlier,
given that memories are not

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:84%
even physically
stored in the brain,

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
it's important to realize that
what I believe is going on

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.390 align:middle line:84%
there is a shift in
that realm of memory,

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
what you might call
the quantum hologram,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:37.160 align:middle line:84%
which is an information source
that we can all connect with.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's there for a purpose.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're not meant
to come into these lives--

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.600 align:middle line:84%
even though we have those
memories as children,

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
they connect us.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And for example,
children can play

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.800 align:middle line:84%
with a departed grandparent
who they may have never known,

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.554 align:middle line:84%
may not have even heard the name
of, and yet they'll be playing,

00:30:54.554 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and they'll mention the
name, because they're really

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:84%
playing with the soul of
that departed grandmother.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So children have
a very thin veil.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.670 align:middle line:90%
But there are processes.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, I mean,
children obviously

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.086 align:middle line:84%
can remember what happened on
the big family vacation a week

00:31:09.086 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:84%
ago when they're three and
four and five years old,

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:90%
and they remember plenty well.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's some
process there that

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.180 align:middle line:84%
makes it so that when
we hit age 6 and 7,

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those memories
from before that time

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:90%
are more difficult to access.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
a broad program that

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.020 align:middle line:84%
also tends to cover up
those memories of past lives

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:90%
and between lives.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's really meant
to be that way so you can

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:90%
have the experiences of life?

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: I think that's the--

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.190 align:middle line:84%
from my point of view, it
kind of sets the stage.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Because when we had the great
higher wisdom of our highest

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:84%
soul that we re-encounter at
the time of physical death

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.370 align:middle line:84%
between incarnations, if
we knew every bit of that,

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't
necessarily be in here

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:52.040 align:middle line:84%
on the stage setting, where
the drama is to unfold.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
We're here to have that
emotional buy in and the power

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.210 align:middle line:90%
of existing in these lives.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And most of us go
through life kind

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that we're
living this incarnation,

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're learning
the lessons of it.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, from my
journey, it was very clear

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that the tough parts of life,
the hurdles and challenges,

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:84%
are really gifts because they
are the engines of our souls'

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:90%
growth.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And yet when you're
in the middle of it,

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.686 align:middle line:84%
that's a very hard
thing to admit.

00:32:16.686 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But often in looking
back over our lives,

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:22.220 align:middle line:84%
we can realize how much we grew
through some of the toughest

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:90%
challenges.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And that takes that
emotional buy in,

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
which involves that whole
programmed forgetting.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So what about those that don't
believe that there is a God

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.677 align:middle line:84%
or that they get stuck in
that place of challenge

00:32:34.677 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and they don't move forward
beyond thinking that there's

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:40.280 align:middle line:90%
passion and purpose in life?

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely normal.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.835 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
here, actually,

00:32:42.835 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:90%
at you talking with Larry King.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY KING: You
believe in reincarnation.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:84%
How come there are
so many more people

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:84%
on the planet now than were
on the planet 100 years ago?

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Turns out that
each and every one of us

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.770 align:middle line:84%
has a lifeline that can
go into multiple different

00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:90%
incarnations.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.320 align:middle line:84%
We often reincarnate
with various soul groups.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:90%
But there is also a program--

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:84%
a programmed forgetting so that
even though children can often

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.660 align:middle line:84%
have past-life memories, they
disappear by about age 6.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a physiologic process.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LARRY: Why don't we have them?

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I know my past?

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, I think part
of it is that we are here

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:22.040 align:middle line:84%
to learn lessons that at this
stage of the game for humanity

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:84%
are best learned if we
basically see ourselves

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.390 align:middle line:84%
as physical beings
with one incarnation.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.850 align:middle line:84%
It gives us skin in the
game, the emotional power

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.510 align:middle line:84%
of engagement, the loves,
the losses, every bit of it.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.060 align:middle line:90%
We need to be engaged with that.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But of course in
meditation, you can

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
learn to separate
and come to see

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that the magic of
your consciousness

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.830 align:middle line:84%
is not that little
voice in your head.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the annoying roommate.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness
is the awareness.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can develop a
much richer awareness.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the part of
you that expands

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.896 align:middle line:84%
when it's liberated
from the brain

00:33:56.896 --> 00:33:58.145 align:middle line:90%
at the time of physical death.

00:33:58.145 --> 00:34:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY: I ask all the
time, what does it all mean?

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm very literal.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe we go anywhere.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not religious.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
a place upstairs.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Upstairs where?

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
anyone's judging me.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.150 align:middle line:90%
I just don't buy it all.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I think religion is fine
for those who have it.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:90%
I think it's comforting.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:90%
But I can expand myself.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.520 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:84%
You say death is temporary
and that I'm going somewhere.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Why am I wrong?

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well,
actually the reason

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.969 align:middle line:84%
the universe exists,
from my standpoint,

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is what we're doing
right here now.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:90%
We're living these lives.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:84%
The point that I try and make
is that we can live these lives

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:84%
better when we realize that
we're more than just one little

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.679 align:middle line:84%
physical incarnation,
birth to death.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.834 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY: So what I
believe doesn't matter?

00:34:47.834 --> 00:34:48.875 align:middle line:90%
It's gonna happen anyway?

00:34:48.875 --> 00:34:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: What you
believe matters a lot.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:55.508 align:middle line:84%
This universe is-- if
nothing else, it is just.

00:34:55.508 --> 00:34:57.230 align:middle line:90%
This is about learning.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.600 align:middle line:90%
It's about love and connection.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.880 align:middle line:84%
We are all really
sharing the one mind.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what near-death
experiencers come back

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:90%
realizing.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.390 align:middle line:10%
No matter what your background,
the near-death experience

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:10%
in most cases brings back
this incredible sense

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.600 align:middle line:10%
of love and meaning of
purpose and connectedness.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all about relationships.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.200 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this together.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just about humans.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It's about all life on Earth.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But I tell you, fundamentally
it's about learning.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And the true answer to all
of the world's dark problems

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is to recover love
for ourselves,

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:84%
because each and
every one of us is

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:84%
a divine connection
to the creative source

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:84%
But also we're all
in it together.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So it really is about a
return to some principles

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.290 align:middle line:84%
that I would say emerged
from the prophets of all

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.860 align:middle line:84%
the great faiths, showing
compassion, kindness,

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:90%
forgiveness, mercy--

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:84%
we're really here to
take care of each other.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY: You say
death is temporary.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: I would say
it's like breathing.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
You breathe in here,
breathe out in death.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And then breathe in again
for another incarnation.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.450 align:middle line:90%
It's an oscillation.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.620 align:middle line:90%
But it's a progression.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not like-- in
some other traditions

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.520 align:middle line:84%
there's this kind of
wheel of suffering

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.932 align:middle line:84%
and that reincarnation is
a wheel that you escape.

00:36:15.932 --> 00:36:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I would say that's
not true at all.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:90%
This is about growth.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:90%
We're here to learn and grow.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:84%
The hardships in life
are actually gifts.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
They are things that
give us the challenges.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's by recovering
love for self and love

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.730 align:middle line:84%
for others, manifesting
that in all the choice

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:84%
of our life, that enables that
soul growth that we're here

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So Larry
talked about that

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning of this clip
that he is atheistic and really

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:84%
didn't believe in anything,
although he didn't call himself

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:90%
an atheist.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.460 align:middle line:84%
How do you handle that when
you're talking about this?

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.251 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY: Well, I think
the important lesson

00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to learn, from my experience
and from many other near-death

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.360 align:middle line:84%
experiences-- and
not just that, from

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the tremendous modern
scientific literature

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:02.040 align:middle line:90%
on the nature of consciousness.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And that includes not only
neuroscience and philosophy

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.042 align:middle line:90%
of mind but parapsychology.

00:37:06.042 --> 00:37:07.500 align:middle line:84%
You can't make
sense of any of this

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.230 align:middle line:84%
until you get deeply
into every bit of that.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that's
becoming very clear

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:84%
is that one needs to
know the brain is not

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
the creator of consciousness
and the physical world is not

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.360 align:middle line:84%
all that exists, and that our
conscious awareness actually

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:84%
can experience many different
modes of a consensus reality.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And only one of them is tied
into this physical realm.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And so in essence, we find
that our conscious awareness

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:84%
is far grander than just this
something that believes maybe I

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:84%
just exist birth to death and
nothing more, ego-focused.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.245 align:middle line:90%
The ego is not who we are.

00:37:44.245 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the little
voice in the head

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.910 align:middle line:90%
is often the voice of the ego.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this discussion is
about expanding that observer

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:90%
self, that deep mystery.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
As I said, that's the part
that expands when you die.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And given the evidence from
all of these lines of research,

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:84%
which we harp on in "Living
in a Mindful Universe"

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and trying to bring
it all together,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:84%
generally the whole notion
that many different lines

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.450 align:middle line:84%
of evidence in many different
fields, when they all converge,

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:84%
it gives you very
strong evidence.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so really, to the discerning
scientific intellectual mind

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:25.890 align:middle line:84%
of the early 2000s,
the year 2018,

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:29.860 align:middle line:84%
following the evidence, what
you expect is that when you die,

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.350 align:middle line:84%
it's not the end
of your existence,

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that your existence actually
expands tremendously.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, reincarnation
is absolutely real.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.150 align:middle line:90%
So we come back again and again.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:84%
That's based on the
scientific evidence.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about religious
scripture and belief systems.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about following
the data about the nature

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And as the science
of consciousness

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.957 align:middle line:84%
expands to fully incorporate
all the empirical data--

00:38:54.957 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I can't wait.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: --and not
just be limited

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.054 align:middle line:84%
by some simplistic and false
assumption, like physicalism,

00:39:02.054 --> 00:39:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that only the physical
exists, therefore

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.520 align:middle line:84%
the brain must
create consciousness,

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.990 align:middle line:90%
and there can be no afterlife.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.260 align:middle line:84%
If you're paying attention to
the scientific data and study,

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:84%
what you expect is that
your consciousness goes

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:84%
through many different
lifetimes, all

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.610 align:middle line:84%
in a process of
ascendance, I might add.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation in this
setting is not just,

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:84%
as some religious
systems would put,

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.850 align:middle line:84%
a mechanistic wheel of suffering
that you're trying to get off,

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:30.420 align:middle line:84%
because all of it is directed
towards learning, teaching,

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.150 align:middle line:84%
becoming, expressing love,
compassion, kindness,

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.990 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness, realizing we
are all in this together,

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.150 align:middle line:90%
sharing that one mind.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a tremendous
lesson for humanity.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's based absolutely
in modern quantum physics

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.287 align:middle line:84%
and modern study of brain,
mind, and consciousness,

00:39:49.287 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and the nature of reality.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's what you
put together in the book.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to see this field
of research 50 years from now,

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.090 align:middle line:84%
60 years from now, where
this is common knowledge.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.759 align:middle line:84%
I can really envision
that happening.

00:39:59.759 --> 00:40:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But first I want you to
take a look at this clip,

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.210 align:middle line:84%
because it really shows
the after-death experience

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and the existence
of consciousness

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.990 align:middle line:90%
before and after life.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: But if you study
the literature, it's there.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, one beautiful case that
I'll only go into very briefly,

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:10%
but there is a book about, it's
called "The Sole Survivor."

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And I highly
recommend this book.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.850 align:middle line:10%
It's been heavily studied
by Jim Tucker, who's

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.300 align:middle line:10%
the current head of DOPS, and
by other people, scientists

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:10%
who are very interested in
these reincarnation stories.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.100 align:middle line:10%
And in this one
particular story,

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.720 align:middle line:10%
this little boy James Leininger,
at about age 2 and 1/2,

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.910 align:middle line:10%
started having nightmares
where he would say,

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:43.760 align:middle line:10%
plane on fire, little
man can't get out.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.200 align:middle line:10%
And then he started talking--

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:10%
when his parents would ask him
about these nightmares night

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.480 align:middle line:10%
after night after night,
he would say, well,

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.180 align:middle line:10%
I was in a plane and was
shot by the Japanese.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a 2 and 1/2 year
old boy maybe 10 years ago

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:10%
who really didn't know anything
about that history of World War

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.020 align:middle line:10%
II, but he said his plane
was shot in the engine.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:10%
And then one of his good
friends, Jack Larson,

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:10%
was there.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.190 align:middle line:10%
Not only that, when he
had three GI Joe dolls

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:14.210 align:middle line:10%
that he had at age
three, he named them

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.850 align:middle line:10%
Billy, Leon, and Walter.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:10%
And he told his parents when
they asked about the names,

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.820 align:middle line:10%
he told them that those were the
names of three of his friends

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.170 align:middle line:10%
who had gone to
heaven before him,

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.381 align:middle line:10%
back when he was shot
down by the Japanese.

00:41:27.381 --> 00:41:29.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, when the parents started
doing a little homework

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and they heard their
little boy talking

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:32.990 align:middle line:10%
about flying off the Natoma.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.790 align:middle line:10%
Now, this boy had no
idea that airplanes

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:36.890 align:middle line:10%
could fly off of boats.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.992 align:middle line:10%
But he said, I flew off
the Natoma in a Corsair.

00:41:40.992 --> 00:41:44.800 align:middle line:10%
This is all information that
he had no way of knowing.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.540 align:middle line:10%
And so it turns out--
and I promise you,

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.620 align:middle line:10%
there's so much
more to this story.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.250 align:middle line:10%
It's just an incredible--
so read "The Sole Survivor"

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.550 align:middle line:10%
if you want to learn more.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.360 align:middle line:10%
But it turns out that the
more homework they did,

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.860 align:middle line:10%
they ended up finding
out that there

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.630 align:middle line:10%
was a ship called Natoma Bay.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:01.600 align:middle line:10%
It was a Casablanca-class
escort carrier

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:10%
in the Pacific involved
in the battle of Iwo Jima.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:06.640 align:middle line:10%
And what they did
is in researching

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.710 align:middle line:10%
that, they went to one
of the reunions of some

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:13.690 align:middle line:10%
of those pilots, and they met
Jack Larson, the very same man

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:10%
who was wonderful friends with
this boy in the previous life.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:21.100 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that the three
names of those GI Joe dolls

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.140 align:middle line:10%
were the three other
pilots who were

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:27.020 align:middle line:10%
killed before he was killed.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this was an
incredible experience,

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:34.720 align:middle line:84%
where he was able to see the
GI Joes of the pilots that

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.580 align:middle line:84%
were killed, and it's
just fascinating.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to explain
some of the hard science,

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.830 align:middle line:84%
other than just the recounting
of people that you interview

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.480 align:middle line:90%
and that we hear stories from.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.770 align:middle line:84%
What is some of the hard
science of the existence

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:49.570 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:50.840 align:middle line:90%
How do they prove it?

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, some
of the-- for example

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.528 align:middle line:84%
I think what you're
looking for is the evidence

00:42:54.528 --> 00:42:56.980 align:middle line:84%
that the brain does not
create consciousness.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.880 align:middle line:84%
That evidence is very strong
in the neuroscience world

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.020 align:middle line:84%
through examples of,
say, terminal lucidity.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Often it's estimated in
somewhere between 5% and 10%

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of Alzheimer's
patients, for example,

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.730 align:middle line:84%
that as they go through
progressive dementia,

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:16.210 align:middle line:84%
as their brain is more and more
impaired over weeks and months

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and even years, to the point
where they might have gotten

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:24.370 align:middle line:84%
reduced to completely unable
to say a word or phrase,

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:28.690 align:middle line:84%
completely detached from this
world and seemingly almost

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:33.340 align:middle line:84%
zombie like, what often happens
in those cases of terminal

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.640 align:middle line:84%
lucidity is they
approach death--

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and statistically it's usually
within a week of death--

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.650 align:middle line:90%
they come back to life.

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:45.730 align:middle line:84%
They all of a sudden just
wake right back in a way that

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.980 align:middle line:84%
conventional neuroscience,
believing brain creates

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.160 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, cannot
possibly explain.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And they come back richly
interactive with loved ones

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:84%
at the bedside, often
when they witness

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.684 align:middle line:84%
souls of departed loved ones
coming to escort them across.

00:44:00.684 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I had this
firsthand experience.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:84%
My husband's
grandmother was passing.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.520 align:middle line:90%
They brought her home.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember specifically
sitting on a couch with her.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:90%
And she had cancer.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But yet she came alive, and
she was hearing this harmonic

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:90%
sound of bells and music.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And then she was talking
with her husband, who

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.020 align:middle line:84%
had passed before and
lots of other friends.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.230 align:middle line:90%
And she came alive fully.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But I was wondering if
she was hallucinating.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: No.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you know?

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: It's often called--

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.670 align:middle line:84%
well, the cases that
are most striking

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.860 align:middle line:84%
are the ones where the
patient has not uttered

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.480 align:middle line:90%
a meaningful phrase for months.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:38.320 align:middle line:90%
And that was the case.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: And you see those.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is a true
mind-blowing terminal lucidity.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:43.880 align:middle line:90%
They're not uncommon.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a hospice worker
I talked with in England

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:51.250 align:middle line:84%
a few months ago told me
she sees it 98% of the time.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.160 align:middle line:90%
I think it depends--

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I believe that.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.968 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: --a bit on
your definition.

00:44:53.968 --> 00:44:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It depends a bit on
how awake and alert

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.770 align:middle line:90%
you are to these kind of things.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But terminal lucidity
is a perfect example

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of how the brain is not the
creator of consciousness.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Another example would be
acquired savant syndromes.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.830 align:middle line:84%
These are where something
like head injury, a stroke,

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:11.680 align:middle line:84%
some kind of brain
damage unleashes

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.210 align:middle line:90%
a superhuman mental capacity.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Say, the ability to
look at a telephone

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.510 align:middle line:84%
book, one page per second,
go through 50,000 names

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and numbers over 20 seconds,
and then be able to answer.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, John Smith,
what is his phone number?

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and pop it out.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't do that
before the brain injury.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.864 align:middle line:84%
And I had one
patient, for example,

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:35.530 align:middle line:84%
who was hit in the
head with a baseball,

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:37.330 align:middle line:84%
had an epidural
hematoma, went to coma.

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Luckily we got it out quickly.

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:40.339 align:middle line:90%
He had a very nice recovery.

00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But it his second
follow-up visit, he

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.004 align:middle line:84%
said, doc, I can do something
I couldn't do before.

00:45:44.004 --> 00:45:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you can explain it.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.140 align:middle line:84%
He asked me if I had
a map, and I did.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I pulled one down,
showed it to him.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:50.955 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at it
for about five seconds

00:45:50.955 --> 00:45:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and then asked me
to put it away.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.920 align:middle line:90%
And then he started drawing.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.800 align:middle line:84%
From the center outward, he
drew this perfect picture

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.540 align:middle line:90%
of that map from memory.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.564 align:middle line:84%
He says, I could
not do that before.

00:46:00.564 --> 00:46:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What happened?

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.290 align:middle line:90%
What did happen?

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.498 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, he got hit in
the head with a baseball,

00:46:04.498 --> 00:46:05.590 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:07.230 align:middle line:90%
It obviously did something.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.470 align:middle line:84%
These cases of acquired
savant syndromes

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.330 align:middle line:84%
are really stunning-- prodigious
memory, prodigious abilities

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:17.410 align:middle line:84%
of calculation, and all that
can come from brain damage.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.664 align:middle line:84%
So mind is not
created by the brain.

00:46:19.664 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, a third category that we go
into in great detail in "Living

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.160 align:middle line:84%
in a Mindful
Universe" are a series

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.460 align:middle line:84%
of recent scientific
studies looking at patients

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.670 align:middle line:84%
under the influence of very
powerful psychedelic drugs--

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:38.560 align:middle line:84%
serotonin 2A receptor drugs,
such as psilocybin, LSD, DMT,

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.810 align:middle line:84%
dimethyl tryptamine, which
is the active principle

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:42.130 align:middle line:90%
in ayahuasca.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that those
scientific studies using

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.440 align:middle line:84%
FMRI, functional
MRI, are sometimes

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.010 align:middle line:84%
magneto encephalography to
look at workings in the brain,

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:53.210 align:middle line:90%
came to a startling conclusion.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is the most
profound experiences

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.690 align:middle line:84%
that people have under the
influence of those drugs

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.690 align:middle line:84%
are associated with the
greatest shutting down

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.460 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
activity in the brain.

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete and
absolute opposite

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.580 align:middle line:84%
of what conventional
neuroscientists, who

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.080 align:middle line:84%
believe brain creates
consciousness,

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.940 align:middle line:90%
would have postulated.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is something we go
into in great detail in "Living

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:84%
in a Mindful Universe,"
because those studies are

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:18.930 align:middle line:90%
very important.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not
recommending to anyone

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:22.297 align:middle line:90%
to go out and use those drugs.

00:47:22.297 --> 00:47:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's very
important to use them

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.480 align:middle line:90%
in a scientific setting.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.970 align:middle line:84%
They're helping us under
a lot about consciousness.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Psilocybin, in
particular, is probably

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:34.060 align:middle line:84%
going to be of tremendous value
in alleviating fear of death

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in cancer patients, in helping
people get over addiction

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:41.560 align:middle line:84%
to things like nicotine,
heroin, other drugs.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:44.560 align:middle line:84%
These psychedelic drugs in
a proper clinical setting

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.330 align:middle line:90%
can be very powerful.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But from a research
standpoint, they basically

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:52.180 align:middle line:84%
support exactly what I saw
in my experience, which

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.050 align:middle line:84%
is this incredible
dismantling of my neocortex

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:58.990 align:middle line:84%
through bacterial
meningoencephalitis,

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.270 align:middle line:84%
opened up this
rich ultra-reality,

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.390 align:middle line:84%
far beyond anything I had ever
experienced in this world,

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.310 align:middle line:84%
just like it's occurring
in those patients

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:07.900 align:middle line:84%
on the psychedelic
drugs where you

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.900 align:middle line:84%
show the shutdown of all
those physical mechanisms

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.810 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what allows
this incredibly robust

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.530 align:middle line:90%
psychic experience.

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I asked that
over and over again.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Was it just that my conscious
mind was just knocked offline,

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I
had this experience

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.310 align:middle line:90%
of expansive connectivity?

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Or did I actually go
to another dimension?

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just
pure consciousness?

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
yes, all of the above.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But my important point
about the psychedelics

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:40.000 align:middle line:84%
is I believe personally that
you can get to that same state

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:84%
through deep
transcendental meditation.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that you
don't necessarily

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.111 align:middle line:90%
need the psychoactives.

00:48:46.111 --> 00:48:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you get into
the right environment,

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:51.070 align:middle line:84%
you can connect with the field
of people who are studied

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.230 align:middle line:84%
or know how to do
this that can really

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.879 align:middle line:90%
get to that place of purpose.

00:48:54.879 --> 00:48:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think that
this is very important.

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It's life saving.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily need
to do psychoactive drugs

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:90%
to find your purpose in life.

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.160 align:middle line:84%
You can really connect to your
bigger why and your bigger

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.040 align:middle line:84%
reason for everything
that will cause

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.500 align:middle line:84%
you to want to live--
beyond addiction,

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.170 align:middle line:84%
beyond suicide, beyond
trauma, beyond anything.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I think it's personally
a possibility.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: I would
agree with you 100%.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:19.903 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
else that we talk about

00:49:19.903 --> 00:49:21.370 align:middle line:84%
in "Living in a
Mindful Universe."

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.830 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with meditation
and centering prayer

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:28.060 align:middle line:84%
being beautiful ways to
get us all to that space.

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
talk in the book

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.050 align:middle line:84%
about using sacred
acoustics tones,

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.630 align:middle line:84%
about differential
frequency brain entrainment.

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It turns out Chris
Christopher Bache--

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.110 align:middle line:84%
B-A-C-H-E-- wrote a beautiful
book called "Dark Night,

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Early Dawn."

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And he did a lot of
personal investigation years

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:52.360 align:middle line:84%
ago using LSD for something
more than 60 actual experiences

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.750 align:middle line:90%
over several decades.

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Personally?

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: And he did personally.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.001 align:middle line:84%
But he also had a tremendous
amount of experience

00:49:58.001 --> 00:50:00.700 align:middle line:84%
with other people using
drugs, and he was deeply

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.340 align:middle line:84%
into the religious and
spiritual aspects of this.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, "Dark
Night, Early Dawn,"

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:11.650 align:middle line:84%
he makes a beautiful case that,
in fact, differential frequency

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.270 align:middle line:84%
brain entrainment,
through sound,

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.670 align:middle line:84%
just like what is used
in sacred acoustics--

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:19.060 align:middle line:84%
but he was used to a
much earlier form of it,

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.220 align:middle line:84%
a form of hemi-sync
brain entrainment

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:84%
that was big in
the '80s and '90s.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But he concludes that the sound
actually takes you further

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:90%
than the psychedelic drugs.

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I would add is it gives
you a more stable environment.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I think the drugs create
too much of a splash,

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's sometimes
very difficult--

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Too much.

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: --to glean the lessons.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a dedicated
practice of going within.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I meditate an hour or two a day.

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:50.080 align:middle line:84%
If you can take 10
or 20 minutes a day,

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.310 align:middle line:90%
that's a beautiful start.

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But going within,
especially if you

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:55.190 align:middle line:84%
have a technique that
helps you to silence

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:58.210 align:middle line:84%
that little voice of anxiety,
the voice of the ego,

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:03.010 align:middle line:84%
but to develop that
observer within, that richer

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:06.070 align:middle line:84%
sense of connection to
your higher soul, all of us

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:08.170 align:middle line:84%
can come to know,
as you just said,

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:11.470 align:middle line:84%
that rich reality of soul,
the reason and purpose

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:14.140 align:middle line:84%
for our existence, how the
hardships and difficulties

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:16.000 align:middle line:84%
are gifts, they're
stepping stones

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to help us along the way,
to help us to grow much more

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.590 align:middle line:84%
fully into the human spirit and
soul that we came to this world

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:24.847 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:51:24.847 --> 00:51:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think
that's very important.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, did he measure
it with a brain scan?

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.090 align:middle line:84%
How did he tell the difference
between the acoustics?

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.798 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: You really
have to read the book.

00:51:31.798 --> 00:51:33.730 align:middle line:84%
It's through
incredible analyses.

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:38.050 align:middle line:84%
He's a very thoughtful
scientist studying all this.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's possible.

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course it's possible
to reach different access

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:46.060 align:middle line:84%
areas of your brain that
are not normally online.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have a question for you
in terms of your meditations

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and what you access.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And what do you see, Eben,
as the future of science?

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going with this?

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, I think
the future is wide open.

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:05.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I often think that we
cannot even begin to glimpse

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:09.370 align:middle line:84%
the future that all of this is
leading to, this revolution.

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It's really a revolution in
thinking that in many ways

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe will make the
Copernican revolution 400

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:20.350 align:middle line:84%
years ago, when we came to
move the center of the universe

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:22.840 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth to the sun--

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it will make
that revolution look

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.280 align:middle line:90%
relatively minor by comparison.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.740 align:middle line:90%
This is a tremendous shift.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's an incredible
recoil against the--

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.690 align:middle line:84%
the message from
materialist science

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:37.270 align:middle line:84%
has been progressively
to show humanity

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:41.650 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a chemical accident
on a little speck of dust

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:45.310 align:middle line:84%
orbiting an average star
in a very average galaxy

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:48.220 align:middle line:84%
off in a distant
corner of the universe.

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And this new thinking actually
kind of shifts the focus

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:55.540 align:middle line:84%
to realizing that the
fact that we have mind

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and we have consciousness
and can actually reflect

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.520 align:middle line:84%
on this universe-- and
especially when we come

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to realize we're really sharing
one mind, in many ways for me,

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:08.960 align:middle line:84%
it calls back the writings
of Teilhard de Chardin,

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.500 align:middle line:84%
back in the mid
20th century, a book

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.230 align:middle line:84%
called "The Phenomenon of
Man," where he basically

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:17.760 align:middle line:84%
kind of shifted things about
our notion of evolution.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And from kind of the minimal
notions of Darwinian evolutions

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:24.340 align:middle line:84%
to biological
systems on Earth, he

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.780 align:middle line:84%
expanded it tremendously to an
understanding of an evolution

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.070 align:middle line:90%
of all of consciousness.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I believe
we are all participating in.

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And that is why this
awakening is so important.

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:41.500 align:middle line:10%
And it's also important because
it will rescue humanity.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.740 align:middle line:10%
We had a divorce
in the 20th century

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.010 align:middle line:10%
mainly from science, from
technology and science,

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:50.110 align:middle line:10%
divorced from human spirit.

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
come, for example,

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.600 align:middle line:84%
chemists committed their
sins in World War I

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.975 align:middle line:84%
with high explosives and machine
guns and poisonous gases.

00:53:58.975 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And separatism.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Physicists
committed their sin

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:04.510 align:middle line:84%
in World War II with the
development of nuclear weapons.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'm sure of is if
we ever have a World War III,

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:11.260 align:middle line:84%
World War IV will be fought
with sticks and stones.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So obviously our
humanity needs rescuing

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:17.260 align:middle line:90%
from our own kind of insanity.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And that divorce was because
the materialist mindset

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of materialist science tried to
put spirit, kind of human soul,

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:26.800 align:middle line:90%
out of the picture.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's not.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:29.560 align:middle line:90%
That's unnatural.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact science is now
putting consciousness, mind,

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.680 align:middle line:84%
spirit, right back at the
core of all of reality.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for this
reconciliation between science

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's crucial for our ongoing
success as a species.

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:50.995 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you think
you're here to do, Eben?

00:54:50.995 --> 00:54:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I ask all of my guests, what
is the biggest, biggest why

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:57.010 align:middle line:90%
as to why you do all you do?

00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, I do
what I do because I

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.890 align:middle line:84%
had an extraordinary experience
that completely shifted

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.950 align:middle line:84%
my understanding of the nature
of brain-mind consciousness,

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and in ways that
I've come to realize

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:12.610 align:middle line:84%
are important for
other people to know.

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:16.420 align:middle line:84%
When I came back to this world,
I had no idea of all that.

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.870 align:middle line:84%
There was no sense
of any giant mission.

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I actually came
back to this world

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.080 align:middle line:84%
because I sensed the presence
of the soul of my youngest

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.680 align:middle line:84%
son, Bond, who as I describe in
"Proof of Heaven," at that time

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.870 align:middle line:84%
he was 10 years old,
that was Sunday morning,

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.320 align:middle line:84%
it was day seven of coma, he
had just overheard the doctors

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:38.260 align:middle line:84%
telling my family it was
time to give up hope and stop

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.397 align:middle line:84%
the medication, stop the
antibiotics, and let me go.

00:55:41.397 --> 00:55:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Even though they protected
him from the worst news

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.060 align:middle line:84%
during that week, he came
running down the hallway,

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:47.630 align:middle line:90%
pulled open my eyelids--

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the ventilator-- one
eye looking this way, the other

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:53.319 align:middle line:84%
down there, and my
pupils were fixed.

00:55:53.319 --> 00:55:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who knows
anything about neuroscience

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.050 align:middle line:90%
knows that's a horrible picture.

00:55:57.050 --> 00:55:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And I did not see him with my
eyes or hear him with my ears,

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.820 align:middle line:84%
but across the vast distances
separating that spiritual realm

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.626 align:middle line:90%
from this realm--

00:56:05.626 --> 00:56:07.000 align:middle line:84%
although they're
not vast at all,

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.180 align:middle line:84%
it's all right here, but it
seemed vast at that time--

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.032 align:middle line:84%
and his presence was
there pleading with me,

00:56:12.032 --> 00:56:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Daddy, you're going to be OK,
Daddy, you're going to be OK.

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:15.949 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand the words.

00:56:15.949 --> 00:56:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But there was some
connection even though I

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.100 align:middle line:90%
didn't know who he was.

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I realize now that I had
to come back to this realm.

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
this realm was,

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and yet I knew I had to
go there to be for him.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.080 align:middle line:90%
He needed me.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was that love, that
incredible bridge of love,

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:34.790 align:middle line:84%
that was the reason I
came back to this world.

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what it's all
about is that love, absolutely.

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EBEN: That is so true.

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I said in
"Proof of Heaven," that

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.730 align:middle line:84%
was the deepest scientific
truth of my whole journey,

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.860 align:middle line:84%
is that love is
the binding force.

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And people might say, well,
that's not very scientific.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll tell you what.

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Where I've been,
it is absolutely

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:54.980 align:middle line:90%
at the core of the science.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You can't make
sense of any of this

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.050 align:middle line:84%
without understanding
that power of love.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The future of
science is when we determine

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.920 align:middle line:90%
what love is scientifically.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: Well, as
Teilhard de Chardin said,

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:11.870 align:middle line:84%
when man really discovers
the deepest truth of love

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and the binding force of
it and how it's written

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.244 align:middle line:84%
into the fabric
of the universe--

00:57:15.244 --> 00:57:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing
him-- but he said,

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:20.800 align:middle line:84%
man will then have discovered
fire for the second time.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful quote.

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:22.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's that big.

00:57:22.665 --> 00:57:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: It's
absolutely that big.

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's that life-saving--

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:26.585 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: And it's a
scientific truth.

00:57:26.585 --> 00:57:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:31.440 align:middle line:84%
You are no longer practicing
as a neuroscientist, correct?

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Or as a surgeon.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EBEN: You can't do
neurosurgery part time.

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So as much as I did
not like leaving

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:38.960 align:middle line:84%
behind the beautiful
world of neurosurgery

00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.510 align:middle line:84%
because I adored my
career in neurosurgery--

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:44.760 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing better
than helping people,

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.720 align:middle line:84%
especially people who are
really in dire straits,

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.860 align:middle line:90%
and I love that.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I still hear from a
lot of my patients,

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and it was a beautiful
part of my experience.

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't
continue to do justice

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.592 align:middle line:84%
to those patients when I was
so busy with all the writing

00:57:59.592 --> 00:58:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and lectures and all that
are involved in this.

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And we appreciate this.

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.190 align:middle line:84%
We appreciate what
you're doing now.

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
helping us understand

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:10.910 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
brain, mind, consciousness,

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and oneness.

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Eben Alexander
has been my guest.

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd like to watch
other shows with Dr. Alexander,

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.730 align:middle line:84%
you can check them
out on Gaia TV.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, I
invite you to stay aware.

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:35.662 align:middle line:90%
