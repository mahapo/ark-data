00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.494 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaia Inspirations."

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:16.160 align:middle line:10%
And our topic for
this series that we're

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.090 align:middle line:10%
taping at this Celebrate
Your Life Conference

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:10%
here in Phoenix, Arizona, is
to explore the "I am" meaning.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:90%
And joining me is Arielle Ford.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
She's a relationship
and manifesting expert

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:10%
who has taught thousands of
people wabi sabi love, which

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:10%
is about how to find the
beauty in the imperfection

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:10%
of our relationships.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.680 align:middle line:10%
Groundbreaking.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ARIELLE FORD: I'm good.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.087 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking
about the "I am" meaning

00:00:43.087 --> 00:00:44.836 align:middle line:84%
and exploring that
throughout this series.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And it really has taken on
a beautiful life of its own.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.214 align:middle line:84%
In this moment, what is
your "I am" statement?

00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Oh, wow.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, I would have to say
that I am a student of love.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: That is pretty
much what I'm up to.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I, as you probably remember,
was a first time bride at 44.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And what I quickly
discovered after I got married

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
was that I had zero
partnership skills--

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know
a thing about how

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:84%
to exist in a relationship
with another human being.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So I committed to becoming
a student of love.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still in
that commitment.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I've learned a lot,
but there's more to go.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, for
living alone for so long

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and doing your own thing
and having your own rhythm,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that must have been
quite an adjustment.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.463 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Yeah, I was really
good at being the boss.

00:01:35.463 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did that go?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Yeah, it doesn't work so
well in romantic relationships.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not very sexy
and attractive,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:90%
being the boss at home.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So how do you soften?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
How did you go
about that and being

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:90%
conscious in your relationship?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:10%
>>FORD: Well, we
actually ended up

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:10%
doing some workshops together
on the masculine and feminine

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:10%
principles and different
roles in relationship

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:10%
and understanding that when
I was running my business,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:10%
it was really good and smart
to be in my masculine energy.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:10%
It was very effective.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
But coming home and
not letting go of that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and dropping into
my feminine energy

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:90%
wasn't fun for either one of us.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.557 align:middle line:90%
So I took up belly dancing.

00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that'll do it.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
transition doing that.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Or I would take
long bubble baths.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Or I would just find a way to
take work head into oh, OK,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
now I need to go into girlfriend
mode or wife mode or something

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.699 align:middle line:84%
a little bit sexier,
more feminine.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And it took a little
bit of practice.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:90%
But now, it's pretty easy.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.006 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's
so interesting.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
We have these different
modes as women,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
where we do drop into different
hats, really, is what they are.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you make a conscious
choice to drop into wife mode.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.612 align:middle line:84%
And there's mother mode, and
there is girlfriend mode.

00:02:51.612 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
There's all these different
roles that we play.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder that women
think that we do it all.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what a soulmate is.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.893 align:middle line:90%
What is a soulmate?

00:03:00.893 --> 00:03:01.266 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Oh.

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:90%
My favorite topic.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe that a soulmate
is first and foremost somebody

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
you can completely
be yourself with,

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:84%
somebody with whom you share
unconditional love, somebody

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.975 align:middle line:84%
that you feel physically
and emotionally safe with.

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:15.775 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:15.775 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And then maybe
most importantly,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
when you look into
their eyes, you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
have this intense
feeling of being at home.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
That you are absolutely
safe with that person.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And what most
people don't realize

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
is that you already have
many soulmates in your life.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So it may be your husband or
your boyfriend or whatever.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's also your children,
your siblings, your parents,

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:84%
your coworkers, your
cats and your dogs,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
because that definition
encompasses unconditional love

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and feeling at home
with them as well.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So for any of the singles
that are listening,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
the good news is you already
have a lot of soulmates.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And the fastest way
to have romantic love

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
is to put your energy and
attention and appreciation

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:84%
on all the love that
you already have,

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
because that makes you
magnetic to romantic love.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So yes, the
answer to that is yes,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
you can have multiple
soulmates, even if you're dating

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and you've felt that one
person was it for a while.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Right.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then all of a
sudden, that spark goes away,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
but you thought that
was your soulmate.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Well, it
doesn't mean that they

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:90%
weren't your soulmate.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: But they may not
be your best life partner.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's the difference?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.543 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: So there's
this myth out there

00:04:26.543 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that we each only get one
big love in a lifetime.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: It's total BS.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not true at all, OK?

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: There are thousands
of potential soulmates

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:90%
for all of us.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing to know.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: But a great relationship
is more than just that heart

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
connection or more
than just chemistry.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:90%
It's compatibility.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:90%
It's connection.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:90%
It's communication.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, it's a
shared vision for the future.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you know
that you want to be a mom.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:84%
You want to give birth and
have your own children.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And you hook up with some
guy who's just fabulous,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.194 align:middle line:90%
but he's already had kids.

00:05:05.194 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
They're grown, they're
out of the house.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:90%
He's done with kids.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Is he your soulmate?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Is he your life partner?

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.365 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Good way of
showing the difference.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, that's a great way.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So what about these
services, dating

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.954 align:middle line:84%
services, where you have people
connecting in different ways?

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
of them, all the way

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
from the match.com
all the way to Tinder.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, I actually
think online dating is

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:90%
the best way to go these days.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the greatest
shopping mall in the world,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
because you can be really
specific about what

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
your heart traits and
needs and desires are.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great
sorting process.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, I actually have friends
that met through Tinder--

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did?

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: --and are
married and have children

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:90%
and are very happy.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And I know the Tinder
reputation is something else.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have to really
decide what's right for you.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But I suggest
anybody who is dead

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
serious on getting married
or finding a long term

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
relationship explore
online dating.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And I can hear people screaming
already, oh, I tried it.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work for
me, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever gone to a
restaurant had a bad meal?

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: OK.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.076 align:middle line:84%
Did you quit eating
because you had a bad meal?

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, unfortunately.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: No.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So you know need to put
on your big girl panties

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and understand that most of the
dates you have through online

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.040 align:middle line:90%
dating aren't gonna be it.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:90%
They're not gonna be fun.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not gonna be wonderful.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep doing
it, eventually, you

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.134 align:middle line:90%
will meet the one.

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's
this idea, though,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:84%
that there's always
another one out there.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.104 align:middle line:84%
There's always another
one out there, because

00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of online dating.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.339 align:middle line:84%
So how do you know
that's the one?

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Well, there's a
couple of different ways.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So most of the
soulmate couples I've

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
interviewed, when I
asked them, how and when

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
did you know-- so the when
'part' is very different.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Some people know instantly.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people didn't know till
after they were married.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But they always
were able to say,

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
you know what, there was just
this level of compatibility,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
this level of connection,
where I knew I could

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:90%
have a great life with them.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
There was just enough
common stuff there.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So whether they felt it in every
cell in their body-- you know,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:90%
yes, Lisa, you're the one--

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.621 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Or whether there
was just enough goodness

00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
there that they went for
it-- you have to just make

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:90%
that determination.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And for most people, if they
have that heart connection

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and there's the shared vision
for the future connection,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:90%
that's a lot.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you wrote a
book about soulmates.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
What is the biggest complaint
that people have when

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.099 align:middle line:90%
they're in the relationship?

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
We've covered the dating
part a little bit.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:90%
But this could go both ways.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Well, I think, for
women-- it's different for men.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But for women, they go in
with this fantasy of happily

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:90%
ever after.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: OK?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I think "happily ever after" are
the three most dangerous words

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
in the English
language for women,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
because the truth is,
when with your soulmate,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
be easy every day.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:84%
There are going to be
moments, days, weeks, maybe

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:84%
even months when you don't
like your soulmate very much.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:90%
You may even hate them at times.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's normal.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
people don't get.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: You know, relationships
are a growth process.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And what a lot of people
don't get about soulmates

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
is that it's the
deepest level of healing

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:90%
you can possibly have.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you say you're a
spiritual person, if you

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:84%
say you're really
working on yourself, then

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
more than anything,
you need a soulmate,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:84%
because all your stuff
will come up to get healed.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.513 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Come up--
absolutely, absolutely.

00:08:35.513 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:84%
Take a look here at this
video where Arielle's

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:90%
talking about a soulmate.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.164 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.164 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: The word "soulmate"
is one of those terms

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that almost everybody
you come in contact with

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:84%
will have a different
definition for.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But my definition
of a soulmate is

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that it's somebody with whom you
have a really deep and profound

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%
connection.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:84%
It's someone you can
completely be yourself

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
with, someone with whom you
share unconditional love.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
into their eyes,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.452 align:middle line:84%
you have the experience
of being home.

00:09:14.452 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:10%
But what a lot of
people don't know

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:10%
is a soulmate is
also someone who's

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:10%
going to be your
greatest teacher, someone

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:10%
with whom you're going to share
an amazing growth, which means

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:10%
that there are going to be days
when there's a lot of conflict.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
the owner's manual to how

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:90%
to push all your buttons.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is,
this is really normal.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So a soulmate is
someone that is going

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to be your lover, your
best friend, someone

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to share your life with,
someone to love and grow with.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:10%
And what I do know for
sure is that everybody

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:10%
has the possibility
of having a soulmate.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in a relationship, and
I'm learning how to relate,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to figure
out where my shortfalls are

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:90%
and his shortfalls are.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about this
in "Wabi Sabi Love."

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:90%
What is wabi sabi?

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: OK.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
So what the heck's wabi sabi?

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Wabi sabi is this ancient
Japanese aesthetic

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that honors all things that
are old, worn, imperfect,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:90%
and impermanent.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And it seeks to find beauty
and perfection in imperfection.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that we've got
this big vase, a Ming vase,

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's got a long crooked
crack down the middle of it.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese would
take this broken vase,

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.990 align:middle line:84%
they'd put it on a
pedestal, and then

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:84%
they would shine a
spotlight on the crack.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So wabi sabi love
is about learning

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to honor and love the
cracks in yourself

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and the cracks in your mate.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And the fastest way I
can demonstrate this

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:90%
is to tell you a story.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So I have these friends,
Jerry and Diane.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And Jerry's a good 30
years older than Diane.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
together over 20 years.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:90%
And Jerry has an addiction.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Jerry is addicted to
poppy seed bagels.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And every single morning,
he goes in the kitchen,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
he slices his poppyseed bagel,
and all the little black seeds

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
go all over Diane's
white tile floor.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Then he toasts the
bagel, and then he

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
walks around the kitchen
eating the bagel,

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:90%
dropping even more poppy seeds.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes,
later, Diane gets up,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:90%
and every morning's the same.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.940 align:middle line:84%
She walks into the kitchen,
she wets a paper towel,

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:84%
she gets on her hands
and knees, and she wipes

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:90%
up all the little black seeds.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, one morning, she was
in a really grouchy mood.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And as she was wiping up the
seeds, she had this thought.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
What would it take for me to
never have to do this again?

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was followed
by the thought,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
oh, that would mean
Jerry's no longer with me.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:90%
And she started to cry.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And from that day
on, every morning

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:84%
as she wiped up the
little black seeds,

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
her heart would fill with
love, because the seeds now

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.247 align:middle line:84%
meant she had another
day to spend with Jerry.

00:12:08.247 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You would think
she would have just bought

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.340 align:middle line:90%
cinnamon raisin bagels.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Right?

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But the story, the point
of this whole thing,

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:90%
is that Jerry didn't change.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.420 align:middle line:90%
His behavior didn't change.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She did.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: She had a
shift in perception.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
She went from
annoyed to enjoyed.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
a great way to be

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
able to do things that
are like that, that

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
are minor annoyances, with the
toothpaste and the toilet seat

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
big stuff, Arielle?

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.360 align:middle line:84%
What about the bills or the
child raising differences?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Those are the big things.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a really
fabulous researcher

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:10%
named Dr. John Gottman at
the University of Washington

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:10%
who's the world's leading
marriage researcher.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:10%
And what he's discovered
is that every couple--

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:10%
not some-- every couple
has a minimum of nine

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:10%
irreconcilable differences.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: These are things on
which you will never agree.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nine.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: That's why,
in every couple,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:84%
there's usually a
spender and a saver.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: God put us
together this way.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So we could learn to love
and respect each other

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:84%
in spite of our differences, so
we could learn to communicate.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:90%
So that happened in my marriage.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I came from a relatively
poor background.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
My husband came from a
very affluent background.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So I came in with all my
poverty consciousness.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And he came in
with his propensity

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:90%
to only shop and buy Armani.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we pooled
all our money.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, freaking
out all the time.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I had to
learn to do was

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:84%
to be very vulnerable and
very authentic with him

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and say to him, you know,
I really do trust you,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and I'm uncomfortable with
this level of spending.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And then as I got to know him
better-- because he had never

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
shopped a sale in his
life-- it's like, well,

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
just try it once, you know?

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
He now shops sales,
and he buys me Armani.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:90%
So we eventually worked it out.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:90%
But there are ways to do it.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I want
to caution everybody

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
about-- here's where wabi
sabi love doesn't work.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So if there is bad behavior,
abuse, or addiction,

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
you cannot wabi sabi
your way out of that.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.198 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: That's when you
need professional help.

00:14:15.198 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:84%
If there's betrayal, if
there's a big trust that's

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
been broken-- but for the
day to day minor annoyances,

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.250 align:middle line:84%
like how many times
do I have to tell

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:90%
you to take out the garbage?

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: That can be handled.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:90%
That can be fixed.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
mentioned money, though.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Is money ever a deal breaker?

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
there's always

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.066 align:middle line:84%
going to be a difference of
income in a relationship.

00:14:35.066 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever going to make the
exact same money, or sometimes,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
one does earn money
and one doesn't.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.439 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Well, that's because
we live in a culture that

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:90%
only values money.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.816 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And a lot of people come
into a relationship thinking it

00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
needs to be 50/50,
which is the sure way

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to kill the relationship.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:90%
You need to give 100%.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:90%
He needs to give 100%.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
matter who's earning what.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:90%
What is everybody giving?

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you were
100% of the money,

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:84%
but he's doing the
grocery shopping

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and taking care of the cars
and driving the kid to school

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and is contributing
in all those ways.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Why are you measuring
his value by money?

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking about
women specifically,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.055 align:middle line:84%
because most of my friends
out-earn their husbands.

00:15:18.055 --> 00:15:19.346 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There has been a shift.

00:15:19.346 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: There's
been a big shift.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So but what--
do you sit down

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.317 align:middle line:84%
with a pro and con
list and a ledger?

00:15:23.317 --> 00:15:24.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you--

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.525 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: No, I
think you just have

00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:27.530 align:middle line:90%
to really have the attitude.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:84%
What is the value of
this relationship?

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:84%
How do I feel when
I'm with this man?

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Do I feel loved,
cherished, adored?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Is he my safe place to land?

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:90%
Am I protected?

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Do we have this really
fun life together?

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And if that's so, this is who
you want to spend your life,

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
then where the money flows in
from isn't really important.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.797 align:middle line:84%
What's important is that you
don't measure it by well,

00:15:54.797 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:90%
he should be earning more money.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
He's the guy.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, in the '50s.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.673 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:00.673 --> 00:16:02.854 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: But you know, we're
a long way from there.

00:16:02.854 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Definitely
changing times.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.278 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, take a
look here at Arielle

00:16:06.278 --> 00:16:09.129 align:middle line:90%
talking about wabi sabi love.

00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: So there's a woman
at the University of Buffalo

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:90%
named Dr. Sandra Murray.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And she did studies on couples
who wear rose-colored glasses.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And what she found
is that couples who

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
wear rose-colored
glasses-- I now

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:84%
call them wabi sabi glasses--
is that they have happier,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:90%
more satisfying relationships.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And she calls it the
Pygmalion effect,

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
phenomenon where

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:84%
when you lift raise your level
of expectation for someone,

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:90%
they rise to meet that level.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
You and I would probably call
it a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when you wear
the rose-colored glasses is

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:84%
you begin to look for what's
right in the relationship

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:90%
instead of what's wrong.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Does it make sense?

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.069 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:56.860 align:middle line:84%
How many of us are
looking for what's wrong

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.740 align:middle line:90%
instead of what's right?

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So I needed a lot of this, me
with the no partnership skills.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
really drove me nuts about Brian

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:90%
happened in the bathroom.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I would go in the bathroom
to brush my teeth,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and I would squeeze--
I'm a bottom squeezer.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Any bottom squeezers here?

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:84%
Squeeze from the
bottom, roll it up nice.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:84%
My husband, he's a mangled
from the middle guy, right?

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.329 align:middle line:84%
So every morning
for years, I would

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
look at my mangled
tube of toothpaste.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had this bad feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Like, why can't he do it my way?

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Why can't he do
it the right way?

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So I got out my
rose-colored glasses,

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and I put the tube of
toothpaste in my hand.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what's
good about this?

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.534 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:48.418 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:48.418 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be something.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:90%
And then it came to me.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank god I married a man
who brushes his teeth.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.741 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:00.741 --> 00:18:01.541 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.541 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, so now I know, as
we grow old together,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:10%
he's going to have
all his teeth.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Wabi sabi love-- it's
a shift in perception.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we've talked
about being single.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about if
you're in a relationship

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and balancing out the
minor differences.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
But what if you're in a
long term relationship,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and at this point, you're not
really in the relationship

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:90%
anymore?

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.057 align:middle line:90%
You've become roommates.

00:18:28.057 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard this?

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yes, I have.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the fastest
ways to reignite and restart

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
your relationship
is to do something

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:90%
that's life threatening.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Do something life
threatening together.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
rollercoasters, bungee jumping,

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.377 align:middle line:90%
zip line, scary movies.

00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: The reason for this is
that when you-- and it doesn't

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:84%
have to be-- I don't mean like
you're really going to die,

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
but you think
you're going to die.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It's something
you're both afraid

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:90%
to do that you do together.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you have this shared
experience and this shared

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
adrenaline rush, it
triggers the brain chemistry

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.030 align:middle line:84%
that had you fall in
love in the first place,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:84%
because all the feelings you
had 20 or 30 years ago, that's

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:84%
still in there for most people--
not for everybody, but for most

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing I would do.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.405 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is a
great recommendation.

00:19:17.405 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
My husband and I
met mountain biking.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of our
favorite things to do together,

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is to go mountain
biking together.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:90%
We have great talks.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:90%
We have meetings.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:90%
And we do so well in that space.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.952 align:middle line:90%
That is a great point.

00:19:30.952 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And people
forget to do it.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So have you drifted
into this sort

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:90%
of it's just good enough zone?

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: You have, but
you can change it.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.856 align:middle line:84%
And this is where personal
responsibility comes in.

00:19:42.856 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And women are
often thinking, why

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:90%
do I have to do all the work?

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like, do you want to
fight for your marriage or not?

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:84%
This is not the kind of
thing guys think about.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
They're OK with
just good enough.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:90%
But you're not.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So since you're the
one who's antsy,

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:90%
there are things you can do.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And then all this is in
my new book called "Turn

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Your Mate Into Your Soulmate."

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:84%
There are actually
16 exercises that you

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:90%
can do to respark the flame.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.930 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing
you need to understand

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:84%
is that if you're starting
to think, well, maybe

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
the grass is greener
somewhere else,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:90%
here's what you need to know.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
You already know that 50% of
first marriages end in divorce.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
What you probably don't
know is 63% of second

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and 74% of third
marriages end in divorce.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: So there's
a lot of good reason

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to actually put in some energy
and some time and some money

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.060 align:middle line:90%
into making things change.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And he doesn't have to do it.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You could actually start
things and not even tell him

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
what you're up to, and
things will automatically

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:90%
begin to change.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this because--
what you're describing here

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is that men are very simple
in that they really like just

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.649 align:middle line:84%
being in a relationship, and
that women are very complicated

00:20:55.649 --> 00:20:58.542 align:middle line:84%
with all the type A-ness
of a relationship.

00:20:58.542 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Well, we're back to
the rose-colored glasses thing,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.765 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

00:21:01.765 --> 00:21:03.431 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: --quite often,
women are looking

00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:06.020 align:middle line:84%
for what's wrong instead of
looking for what's right.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that true, men?

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And the other thing
is that they don't understand

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:84%
is that most men really,
at the very bottom line,

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.880 align:middle line:84%
can only be happy
if you're happy.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:90%
They want you to be happy.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And you could be thinking,
I tell him all the time

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:84%
what I need for him to
do for me to be happy.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is,
when you're doing it

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:84%
in a nasty tone of
voice or you're nagging

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:84%
or you're yelling, he
literally can't hear you.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:84%
His brain doesn't
function like our brain.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:90%
He's not listening.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So in "Turn Your Mate
Into Your Soulmate,"

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I give you scripts on how
to actually speak in a way

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.310 align:middle line:84%
that he can hear
and he'll respond.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.645 align:middle line:90%
These are test-proven--

00:21:46.645 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, give
us an example,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
to dumb down men here.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:90%
I wanna--

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.155 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Well, they're not dumb.

00:21:51.155 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: It's the women
who aren't smart enough

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:90%
to speak into their listening.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: OK.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.346 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing what we
watched our mothers do.

00:21:58.346 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're nagging and yelling
and screaming and complaining

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.917 align:middle line:84%
and whining and
bitching and moaning,

00:22:02.917 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:84%
which, if you've been
doing it for 20 years,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:90%
you know is not effective.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But you've never bothered
to learn how to do it.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say
your complaint is

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:84%
his job is to take out the
garbage on Sunday nights.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But you always
have to remind him

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're tired
of reminding him.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is the next time--

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
wait for him to do it on his
own, and then when he comes in,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:84%
give him the sexiest hug ever
and say, you are my hero.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I am so grateful you
took out the garbage.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I have to touch
that thing, it's so dirty

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's so smelly and it's
so icky, I just feel awful.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But when you do this for me,
I get to feel like a queen.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.815 align:middle line:84%
Now, is he gonna forget to
take out the garbage next week?

00:22:48.815 --> 00:22:49.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:22:49.615 --> 00:22:52.304 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Probably not, because he
just had this big win with you.

00:22:52.304 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But the
operative thing is

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.727 align:middle line:84%
that you said, wait
for him to take out

00:22:55.727 --> 00:22:56.685 align:middle line:90%
the garbage on his own.

00:22:56.685 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:57.936 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You said that.

00:22:57.936 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Yeah, and
it may be a while.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:84%
It may be till it's--
but you have to wait.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Guys do not like to
be told what to do.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is true.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: They don't like
it-- none of them, even

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:90%
the most conscious ones.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you tell
them what it's going

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to provide for you,
what it's going to do,

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and what that actually means
and your level of happiness,

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:84%
which gives him joy, you're
going to get a better response.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one
really small example.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.609 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that's great,
because I don't think anyone

00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:90%
likes to be told what to do.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: No.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, you go
through that when you're out

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:90%
of childhood, then no.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Because then,
you become their mother.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Right?

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.703 align:middle line:84%
And their mother
told them what to do.

00:23:36.703 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So they're not like, oh,
here's Lisa, my beautiful wife.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, it's
that mom voice.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:90%
So those are great fixes.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But what if you are
into years and years

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and years of resentment or
not addressing these issues?

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you start?

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: You know, you
just start with the truth,

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:90%
from a really vulnerable place.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
There's something I really
need to share with you.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm scared to death to say
it, because I love you so much

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to hurt you
and I don't want to hurt me.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:84%
But I just need to
tell you A, B, and C.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.990 align:middle line:90%
So you're not blaming.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:90%
You're not shaming.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from an "I" place.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
do such and such,

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
I know you don't mean
to hurt my feelings,

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:84%
but every time you say A, B,
and C, this is how I feel.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And I know you would
never want to hurt me,

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
but I've been too
scared to tell you.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.179 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did-- there's no
defensiveness needed there.

00:24:27.978 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's also you took that
along on your own self.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is how I feel.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:90%
This is what I want to tell you.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
This is how I'm
experiencing this.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And then
only one thing a day.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Don't pile it on.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:41.479 align:middle line:84%
Not like, here's the 20 years
of things I haven't told you.

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you took
responsibility--

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:84%
what you said about taking
personal responsibility

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:90%
is how you feel.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yes.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then if
somebody says to you, well,

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
what-- do you have to do
that without expectation,

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:53.502 align:middle line:90%
by the way?

00:24:53.502 --> 00:24:54.628 align:middle line:90%
For them to say, I'm sorry?

00:24:54.628 --> 00:24:56.168 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: You know,
I think expectation

00:24:56.168 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:90%
gets in the way of things.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I think so too.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Really, you just
want to convey the truth.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And the thing you
need to remember

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:84%
is that your husband didn't
wake up this morning thinking,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:90%
how can I make Lisa crazy today?

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: OK?

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wakes up
like that, yet we

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:84%
live like they're doing
everything on purpose.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmhm.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look here
at Arielle talking

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
about those statistics,
and why it's

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
important to turn your
mate into your soulmate

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:26.176 --> 00:25:29.736 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Let me give you
one really good reason why

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
you want to turn your
mate into your soulmate.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So we all know that 50% of
first marriages end in divorce.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But what you may not know is
that 67% of second marriages

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and 74% of third
marriages end in divorce.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't have
to be that way.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%

back on track,

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to
talk to each other

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's really loving
and kind and effective.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's not that hard.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It just requires that
somebody take the initiative.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And that somebody may be you.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
develop an attitude.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, why do I have
to do all the work?

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:90%
It's really not work.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:90%
It's just a shift in perception.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Just try a few of these things.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Do something a little different.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And what will happen will
be an amazing, unbelievable,

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.805 align:middle line:84%
unimaginable transformation that
creates the love of a lifetime.

00:26:39.805 --> 00:26:43.336 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.336 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why do you think
those divorce statistics are

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:84%
so high in the second
and the third marriages?

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you're carrying
over the same problems?

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Yes, because
the only thing

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.340 align:middle line:84%
that's constant in all
those marriages is you.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you haven't done
the deeper inner work,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't
changed, if you haven't

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
gotten to the root of your
problems, your patterns,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
you're just going to recreate
the same situations over

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.720 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So it may look like
he's the problem.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: But everybody comes
in with their stuff, you know?

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's got to be
responsible for working

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:90%
through stuff.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I think
the statistics just

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:90%
get worse as you marry more.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, when you
were single for 44 years,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:84%
did you ever think that
you would just stay single?

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Or did you eventually want
to find that soulmate?

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: I actually knew
in my heart that some day,

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:90%
I would get married.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't put
a lot of attention

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:84%
on it, because I was so
busy building my business.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was having so
much fun doing it.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was really having fun
complaining about my love life,

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.135 align:middle line:90%
I was my story.

00:27:44.135 --> 00:27:44.935 align:middle line:90%
I had this story.

00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm always with
these super toads.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're always this
and they're always that.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But the truth was-- is that
I was commitment phobic.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.630 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So until I started
to work on that

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and realize that that was
my issue, that I was really

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:84%
afraid of love-- I
needed to transform me

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:84%
before I was ready to welcome
in what I call big love.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.592 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you realize
that you were commitment phobic?

00:28:11.592 --> 00:28:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: A friend of mine
said it to me one day.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you're always
blaming those guys.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:90%
You're the one with the issue.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I knew enough about popular
psychology and self-help.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, that
hurt, but that's true.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
when you realized

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:84%
that, were you then
open to receiving

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.167 align:middle line:90%
a relationship in your life?

00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:29.966 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: I was.

00:28:29.966 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I worked on it on
multiple levels.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.370 align:middle line:90%
I went to therapy.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I did this thing called
the Hoffman process, which

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:90%
really made a difference.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I was also consciously
manifesting a soulmate.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw was that because
every guy I had dated had

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.364 align:middle line:84%
a similar sort of
demographic to him--

00:28:48.364 --> 00:28:50.572 align:middle line:84%
they were all sort of captain
of the universe types--

00:28:50.572 --> 00:28:51.372 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:28:51.372 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: I realized that
what my soul was calling for

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:84%
was somebody who was
really generous, not

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
so much with their wallet,
but with their love

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation and
affection and attention.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what I needed.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be the center
of somebody's universe

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
instead of always
complaining about Mr. X, who

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.874 align:middle line:90%
never had enough time for me.

00:29:11.874 --> 00:29:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you
also were allowing

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.895 align:middle line:84%
yourself to be the center
of somebody's universe.

00:29:15.895 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: For the first time.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And ultimately,
that's what men want to do,

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:90%
is that they do want to protect.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:90%
They do want to take care of.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think the key
in any relationship

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:84%
is knowing that you've
got each other's backs.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Right.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's huge.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And the thing--
I was so independent

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
that for me, having someone
take care of me made me needy.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had
to embrace the fact

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:84%
that there was this Arielle
part that was needy.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It was needy for
love and attention.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And once I was able to
get comfortable with that,

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:84%
now, I'm just sort
of a sponge for it.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's take this from
the male perspective.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yeah.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How would you
coach a man, a husband,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:84%
into softening a
wife who is still

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.902 align:middle line:84%
in this strong very
survival perspective?

00:29:57.902 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:10%
>>FORD: You know,
what Brian always

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:10%
did with me is that he
would always tell me,

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm here for you,
I'm your safe place

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:10%
to land, we're here to heal
each other, my reason for living

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:10%
is you.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear that
day after day after day

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and you get all these hugs
and kisses and affection,

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.472 align:middle line:84%
eventually, you
start to believe it.

00:30:19.472 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't believe
it the first couple years.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.679 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, he's just
saying the right thing.

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, because
he was so consistent,

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I got to see that it was true.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.285 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other
flip side of it was

00:30:30.285 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:84%
he was never afraid of my
power or my independence.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.706 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:30:34.706 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Ever.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.010 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
likes that about me,

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.730 align:middle line:84%
because he had a
very strong mother.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it seems like
he's very emotionally available.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yes.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I know Brian, and
he is a very conscious man.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But in the case where there
is pain in a relationship,

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that both the
male and the female

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.600 align:middle line:84%
want to find a resolution,
want to find solution.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And you offer a lot
of those in your book.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.325 align:middle line:90%
It makes so much sense, Arielle.

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
What you have to say
makes so much sense.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Well, I had to learn
it for my own survival.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: And then I
road tested all of it.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.100 align:middle line:90%
So I know that it works.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:84%
There's actually 16 exercises
in "Turn Your Mate Into

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Your Soulmate"
that you can begin

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to use the day you get the book
that'll make amazing changes.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
offering solutions.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:90%
I so appreciate.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Oh, thank you.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.635 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if you would like to
