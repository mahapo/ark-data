00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: If you want to
break free from an old story,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:10%
you also have to break
free from the place

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:10%
that that story was created.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.060 align:middle line:10%
These are the words of intuitive
guide and spiritual teacher,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Sonia Choquette in her
latest of 24 books,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:10%
"Waking Up in Paris-
Overcoming Darkness

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
in the City of Lights."

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
a really big change,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
this can be a time
to reinvent yourself.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And Sonia is here to help us let
go and let your soul guide you

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:90%
and your guides guide you.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.602 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, my friend.

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SONIA CHOQUETTE:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy to be here.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I'm happy
to be here with you.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.622 align:middle line:84%
At this time in your life,
you have so much to offer.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well, thank you.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:10%
I've been through
a lot of change.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:10%
And a great deal of it
certainly not wanted.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:90%
But I'm grateful for it.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to share with
people that change and growth

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:90%
are messy.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And spiritual tools
help you deal with them,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:90%
but don't help you avoid it.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's gonna happen.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Life is temporary.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So you can't use spirituality
to kind of push that

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:90%
away or protect you--

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gloss over it.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And a lot of people
hope that that's the case.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Frankly, at times me too.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
However, I've learned that
real spirituality is letting

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
your spirit lean into life, take
it full on, and just really run

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
with as much courage as you
can through the difficulties.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And trust that your soul
knows what it's doing.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right here.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.130 align:middle line:90%
Right here on the chin.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead give it to me.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.482 align:middle line:90%
It's hard sometimes.

00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It can be.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important for
us to recognize that change--

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:84%
it kind of scares
our reptilian brain.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, part
of it is whatever

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I do, I need to be in control
of this makes it worse.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So if we could just
recognize that change

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean loss, setback,
mistakes, guilt, blame, shame.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Just growth.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot easier.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, talk
about your story.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So you went through
this incredible journey

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:90%
through the Camino de Santiago.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote a
great book about it.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.928 align:middle line:84%
And can you tell us a
little bit about why

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:84%
you went on the journey
in the first place?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well the season
of change for me started about

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
eight years ago when
all of a sudden,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:90%
in a very short period of time--

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
six weeks-- my brother
died in his sleep.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
The shock caused my father
to die six weeks later.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is a man who
I never knew to be sick

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:90%
a day in his life.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And the one two of
that caused so much

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:84%
stress in my marriage,
my husband left.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So it was a brother,
father, husband.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Boom gone.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was left
pretty blindsided.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Within six weeks?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.372 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: And I just had a--

00:03:16.372 --> 00:03:19.940 align:middle line:84%
it was six weeks of
just bam, bam, bam.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And I prayed.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like,
oh, please guide me.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
It was like, help me.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And one day I just got this
guidance to go on the Camino.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And to tell you the truth, I
didn't even really know that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:90%
well what it was.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And I also was given the
instruction to walk it.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just had a knee
surgery because I

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
went boxing, kickboxing,
to work out my frustrations

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and broke my knee.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, OK.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Well,, if this is guidance, I'm
going to need a lot of help.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
But I went.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You went.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a 500 mile
trek across Spain.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It took me 35 days.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was in May,
which you would

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
think would be good weather,
but it snowed like mad

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:90%
when I started.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In May?

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It was crazy.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But I would say in so many
fundamental and in life

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:84%
changing ways, I healed some
really ancient lifetimes old

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
wounding in the
process of walking.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And I came to find a
certain peace within myself

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:90%
that I had never known.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:90%
A groundedness maybe.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.157 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
mean by lifetimes old?

00:04:40.157 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Honestly, I'm
not being metaphorical.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I really believe we
have multiple lifetimes.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I had
lifetimes actually

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.535 align:middle line:84%
on that particular path
as a Knights Templar.

00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I had this and always
grew up with this sense

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%
of warrior in me.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But I had dreams
about this experience

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.208 align:middle line:84%
when I didn't know what it
was, when I was 15, 16, 20.

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it all came to you?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And it all came
back to me on this journey.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it helped bring
a new level of aha

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and a new level of
closure to this always--

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
like, my interface with
life was, I'll save you now.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And that didn't leave a
whole lot for my own needs

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:90%
to get met.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
big personal aha.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know I had
that many personal needs.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.503 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you had this
archetype of a hero.

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:38.303 align:middle line:90%
Shero.

00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Definitely.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
I was a shero.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I was a magician.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll walk through fire.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of courage.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But I was not comfortable
with, or even in touch

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:84%
necessarily with, my
needs for support.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I lost my brother,
my father, and my husband,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:84%
that gaping hole in
my soul sucked me in.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I walked out of that
hole with the Camino.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.037 align:middle line:84%
For you to be there
for yourself finally.

00:06:06.037 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest--

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It was a shock.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was a surprise
because I didn't even

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:90%
know I wasn't there for myself.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And you know, even in
the spiritual world,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
you're rewarded for
being the magician that

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:90%
pull a rabbit out of your hat.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was really good at that.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So when the first level
of my life collapsed--

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's more?

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to
go this, actually.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look at
this great video here of--

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see the
Camino and Sonia's journey.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.023 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:06:37.023 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: My name
is Sonia Choquette.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And for the last 30 years,
I've been a spiritual teacher.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And for the last 20, I've
been a published author.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've spoken to people
all over the world.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Inspiring them, helping
them, lifting them up.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:90%
And I have loved it.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Everything was going well
until a few years ago.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:84%
In the course of six
weeks, my brother

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
died, my father died,
my marriage imploded.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And my life as I
knew it fell apart.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I taught thousands of
people around the world.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I was the one who was
lifting people up.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't understand why
I couldn't lift myself up.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
This shouldn't be
happening to me.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:84%
I received the
guidance that I was

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
supposed to leave everything
behind and walk a pilgrimage.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The Camino de Santiago, also
known as the way of St. James.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:90%
The way of forgiveness.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
My pilgrimage began not
just looking at a mountain,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:90%
but at a mountain range.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.443 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like the
mountain of old stuff.

00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:52.690 align:middle line:90%
It was overwhelming.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It was spring, almost June.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And second day of my
pilgrimage, it snowed.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And so now I had to walk
through mud, and muck, and ice,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and cold, just like all
the pieces of my life

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that I had not yet
fully healed from.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Step by difficult step,
something really big

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Old emotions that
I had shoved aside

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
started breaking up,
moving on, and giving me

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:90%
a little more freedom.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness started coming back.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:84%
And one step at a time pieces
of me that I didn't even know I

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
had lost it started coming back.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:47.602 align:middle line:84%
And more and more I
started to feel grounded.

00:08:47.602 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Healed.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
More and more I walked
myself back into the most

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
profound level of wholeness that
I have ever experienced or knew

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:90%
was possible in my life.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.934 align:middle line:90%
I walked home.

00:09:02.934 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It seems like the
Camino just calls to you.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It does.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:84%
It was never something that I
intellectually searched out.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I was asked.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:90%
My soul pulled me in.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to
other people since then

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:90%
who've also walked the Camino.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And they've said the same thing.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
That there's some particular
energy that pulls you in.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe
it's a magical path.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not glamorous.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of mud.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:90%
There's-- yeah.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: There's
not a lot of comfort.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But it supposedly follows
ley lines or magnetic lines

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And, honestly, walking that
particular path changes

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and heals things that no
amount of just Gestalt therapy,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and praying, and
meditating-- there's

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
something fundamentally
in the bones of your soul

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that kind of releases that I'd
say that the Camino did for me.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It gave me a strength
to love myself

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't have before.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you meet
people along the way?

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.258 align:middle line:84%
Were they going through
similar journeys?

00:10:37.258 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: You
know, it's so funny.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I had this hat wrapped up and
didn't want to talk to anybody.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And then it slowly
started coming off.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And I started
meeting other people.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of experiences.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I met a person.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And we had this whole
conversation about his child

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.265 align:middle line:90%
molesting experience.

00:10:55.265 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't even
speak English.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:90%
He spoke Greek.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.220 align:middle line:90%
But we understood each other.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.680 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:90%
I met a man.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.940 align:middle line:84%
My husband, who we
just separated from,

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:90%
his name was Patrick.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the only male I met on the
Camino for any amount of time

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:90%
was Patrick, of course.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And he
became a bridge for me

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to really work through some of
my horrendous hurt and outrage

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
with Patrick and my
understanding of seeing things

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:90%
from a different perspective.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:90%
So he was perfect.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The characters
along the way.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: The characters.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.182 align:middle line:84%
It's like you step out
of the third dimension,

00:11:37.182 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the
Twilight Zone, but it's

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
kind of a marvelous
Twilight Zone.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would definitely
recommend it as--

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and even I've learned that
the back and forth of left

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:84%
right, left right, and walking
heals your brain in a way

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:90%
that I could say it really does.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: 500 miles of
right left, right left.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of time to think.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: There was
plenty of times I thought,

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.292 align:middle line:90%
what the heck am I doing?

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I totally
would understand that.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: But eventually,
when it was over, I was sad.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was like a friend.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.958 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It was a friend.

00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And the friend was me because
I got to spend 500 walking

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:90%
miles with--

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
so many parts of me I'd
forgotten or ignored.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
the friendship was me.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.108 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can you explain that?

00:12:25.108 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Forgotten parts of you?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.367 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well, you know.

00:12:27.367 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I just definitely feel,
especially as a woman,

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:84%
we are raised and rewarded
for sacrificing ourselves,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and for not needing much,
and for really giving.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And I took that to epic
levels as an intuitive

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
because I could X-ray
into any situation

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and very accurately know
exactly what you needed.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But it was never encouraged
that I do that for myself.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Not even in my
spiritual training.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Not in anything.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:90%
And certainly not as Catholic.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So I went through
this whole experience

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
of being so there for others
and didn't quite know what

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:90%
was wrong with this picture.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Because I loved that.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't wrong.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:90%
It just was incomplete.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It was romantic.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It was fulfilling.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was creative.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was empowering to others.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I was
really fulfilling purpose.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But there was a piece
connected back to me

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:90%
that goes way back to childhood.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And lifetimes of self-sacrifice
is the noble, highest purpose

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that my
Camino is the beginning

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.758 align:middle line:84%
of my fundamental
change of value system.

00:13:36.758 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would you say it's
absolutely no accident

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:90%
that all of that happened?

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Absolutely.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I would say it was
divinely planned.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I think part of my purpose is
to help women change their value

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
systems at this point
to love themselves

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
in more than an
intellectual I love myself,

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:90%
put on my lipstick way.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think anybody
would give me the time of day

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
unless I've been through
that fire personally.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Because people can tell.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a texture.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: There's
a texture too--

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, unless you
really know the mechanics

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:90%
of that on the deepest level.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And easier said than done.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought my
journey was over.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.878 align:middle line:90%
And then you came home.

00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And you thought that
it was complete.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%
And you wrote a book about it.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It was like--

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it was great.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: --the
angels came out.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And my husband came back
and said, I miss you.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's make up.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.210 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that's my reward.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to walk
the Camino together.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, you know,
you hear the refrain

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:90%
in the background and, oh.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And then six weeks before
we were to walk together,

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.377 align:middle line:84%
he decided that he
wanted a divorce.

00:14:47.377 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: After you prepared and--

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Oh,
and told the world,

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and celebrated, and was
standing naked to the world of,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
you know, see the
happy ending does come.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:90%
And then I got slammed again.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And it truly, truly
blindsided me.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And I read your book.

He served you papers.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:90%
He didn't even--

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually,
here's the truth.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching workshop.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And I got a notice
from my attorney

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:90%
that Patrick wanted to continue.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
He would let me know
about the divorce

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
after we walked the Camino
and that I was on probation.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm a Romanian.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was not going to
be on anyone's probation.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:90%
I have a fiery dragon spirit.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Don't let this cutesy
poodle look fool you.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, oh no.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:90%
We're done.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And in one minute, 32
years of being together,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and a whole life, and a
whole commitment to that life

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:90%
was just like pa-choo.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.510 align:middle line:90%

kids, a community, a life.

And I'm a Catholic.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:90%
We said, I do forever.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I
just felt so betrayed.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:90%
By God.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:90%
By him.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:90%
By my spiritual tool.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:90%

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did that reignite the

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Oh, my god.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happened.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going
to have a heart attack.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I thought was going to
have a nervous breakdown.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.685 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because your
heart was hurting.

00:16:21.685 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And it
was the very week

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I was going in Colorado to do
my first talk about the Camino

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was having literally
a nervous breakdown.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter, Sonia,
called her sister.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I don't
know what to do.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm dramatic.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, honestly.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:90%
I had the mask on.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm crying.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the room.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm at the hotel.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And Sabrina, my second
daughter, called me.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And she said, OK.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I was driving on Lake
Shore Drive in Chicago

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and asked Mother
Mary what to do.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said to give
you a choice, mom.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.572 align:middle line:90%
We can either move to Paris.

00:17:06.572 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Or we can take you
to the hospital.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:90%
What's your choice?

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And
it was like Paris.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Paris.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:90%
Hospital.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's something in me.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It was like another
divine intervention.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:90%
I said, let's move to Paris.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, OK.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:90%
We'll leave in six weeks.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And I got up,
and I went and gave my talk,

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and I told them.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, actually, the book
says happily ever after.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is we're
getting a divorce.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm moving to Paris.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.615 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my god.

00:17:44.615 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
You didn't even
think about this.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:90%
We were gone.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.370 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did audience--
how did they respond?

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well, it was
kind of the last statement

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
before I put on the
music and danced.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So they really
didn't have a chance.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was still
absorbing it myself.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, that's just
the way that just happened.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:90%
That just happened.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:12.667 align:middle line:84%
And I was happy I had
something to look forward to.

00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's very
interesting, though.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
that, you took a jump

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
into a different
reality in your mind.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Like that.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's how
quick it can happen.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.455 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Now,
one thing I will say.

00:18:23.455 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Due to my spiritual--

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
actually, I don't even like
to use the word spiritual

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
because I think
that's very mental.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Due to my spirited education,
my connection to spirit,

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:90%
I knew it would be OK.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I just internally, without any
intellectual participation,

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:90%
I knew.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:90%
It felt right.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that Sabrina's
invitation was definitely

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:84%
sent from Mother Mary,
from the divine feminine.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I knew that was a piece of
need that needed to be healed.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.973 align:middle line:84%
And what more feminine place
on the planet than Paris?

00:18:57.973 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: First of

And they tell me like it is.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:90%

your whole life.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:90%
You've exercised this muscle.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
You've taught other
people how to do it.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:84%
You raised your
children how to use it.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:84%

You touch something.

00:20:08.293 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:90%
You scream.

And to me, that's
like what it's like.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like a permanent
blackout to not

have your intuition be your
primary guidance source.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to guess, and feel,

I just can't imagine.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:84%
make people do what you want,
doesn't make life go your way,

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:84%
doesn't bypass
your soul journeys.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%

And that is where I was.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But that is so huge.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
That compass, that
inner guidance system,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that intuition is
your best friend

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:90%
and will never betray you.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.123 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Sure didn't.

00:21:07.123 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I believe you.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: We went
flying into Paris with--

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and here's an
interesting point too.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:84%
The day we left was the
day that the Charlie

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.685 align:middle line:84%
Hebdo, the first terrorist
attacks, happened.

00:21:20.685 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And everybody we knew called
us and said, you can't go.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, we're on
our way to the airport.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:90%
We're going.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you didn't say
that was a block or a barrier.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Not for me.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You felt it.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.685 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I actually
almost thought,

00:21:33.685 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
well, this is another
reason why we're going.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.740 align:middle line:84%
We can bring about
some light and healing

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.380 align:middle line:84%
even though I know
France very well.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I know Paris.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:90%
This was not the Paris I knew.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:84%
A Paris that had
terrorist attacks.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:90%
A Paris that had trauma.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:90%
But I thought, well, of course.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:90%
We're both traumatized.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:90%
We'll heal together.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
how my brain works.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:84%
My brain doesn't
get a vote on much.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:90%
My spirit makes the choices.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And my brain knows it
has to get on board.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That takes practice.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.545 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Definitely.

00:22:06.545 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: That
takes practice.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And that's
what I teach people.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Because so many brains take
over completely, analyzing it,

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.410 align:middle line:90%
and weighing the odds.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And yes this will,
if that, then this.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:90%
And we mentalize it.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I think my
brain would have given me

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:90%
a nervous breakdown.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I was
heading that way.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I had a good couple
weeks of that.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:90%
I hated that.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I would rather go into the
unknown than let my brain lead

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:84%
me into complete
depression and victimhood.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But we make
those choices out of fear

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And we think
of the lack of awareness

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have a choice,

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:90%
this other self we can trust.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:90%
This true self.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And we can't negotiate with it.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't ask that deeper
self to explain anything.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:90%
You just have to go.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, when going

your brother, did

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:84%
you ever try to
negotiate about that,

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Uh-uh.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No?

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.615 align:middle line:90%
You're just intuition took over?

00:23:11.615 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Totally.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.373 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: When my brother
died, I knew he was done.

00:23:16.373 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, right before he died--
it was the night before he

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.590 align:middle line:90%
died, he called me.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.780 align:middle line:90%
It was his birthday.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
My brother had a lot
of drug problems.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:90%
He had schizophrenia.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:90%
He had a lot of problems.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And he had come around
and was managing.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.593 align:middle line:90%
His soul was so beautiful.

00:23:31.593 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And he called me
up and he said, I

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:37.180 align:middle line:84%
want you to buy the
Rolling Stones DVD

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Shine a Light for my birthday.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I want.

That's how I want you to
see me on my birthday.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.967 align:middle line:90%
And he died that night.

00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: By natural causes?

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: By natural causes.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:90%
By stress.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he wanted
me to remember him that way.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, my dad was really
devoted to my brother's care.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:90%
And I swear--

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I am confident his
death was such a trauma

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and my dad was such a caretaker
of my brother, he followed him.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:90%
He followed him.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:90%
He just went right in.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:84%
He went across the
valence that I--

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I want to be with him.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I
belong over there.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:90%
So I knew that.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't know,
and what I found out of the

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.487 align:middle line:84%
on the Camino, is
how much resentment

00:24:23.487 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I had toward both of them
for all the trouble they

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:84%
caused us, and for
lack of support to me,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and how I just bypassed myself

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:90%
matrix of need.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I don't
get to need anything.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So as I was walking, and
then after my husband

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:47.400 align:middle line:84%
left and decided
then part B came in.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:84%

You're going to teach.

You're going to teach because

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I really think
I signed up for all of this.

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:13.988 align:middle line:84%
And I am that person

00:25:13.988 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
if there's a parade

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I will be the first

I will not be the one

I'm just that--

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's who you are.

>>CHOQUETTE: --soul.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:90%
So I dived in.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, OK,
well, right now we

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
need to learn that
intuition isn't

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
some insurance against
having your life interrupted.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Intuition is the guidance
through the jungle

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:84%
because your life is
going to be interrupted.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:84%
We are on a planetary

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.440 align:middle line:84%
We're all going
to be interrupted.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So now I realize, OK, I was
in practice all those years

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:84%
for now, and for
the kinds of things

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:84%

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.413 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, yes.

00:26:02.413 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
We do live under this
illusion that life

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:90%

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And we try our whole

>>CHOQUETTE: And
that's why it's a lie.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a lie.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:90%

And the perfect is

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I think the feminine, which

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the female, but the

It is not OK.

That's tolerating it.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It's necessary, and sacred,
and love it, and never

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:90%
apologize for it.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:90%
That is-- yes.

Take a look here at
Sonia's journey to Paris

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.870 align:middle line:90%
and waking up in Paris.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.580 align:middle line:84%

your own reinvention

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Hi, my
name is Sonia Choquette.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm an intuitive guide.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:90%
A spiritual teacher.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:90%
A writer.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:54.540 align:middle line:10%
And for the past 35 years,
I've been traveling the world,

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:10%
motivating people to live
at their highest most

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:10%
creative level.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet I have discovered that
for even people like me who

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
are devoted to mastering
everything life throws at you,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:84%
there are some things
no one can escape.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:84%
The first is death,
of course, and taxes.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:16.350 align:middle line:84%
But the third, and the one
blindsided me is change.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Came in the form of an
unwanted, devastating divorce

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:84%
after being married
for 32 years.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:90%
With it, I lost my home.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I lost my financial
stability, my community.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But the most painful
and surprising

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.930 align:middle line:90%
was that I lost my identity.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the life and the self
that I had cultivated for all

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.622 align:middle line:84%
these years was
suddenly just gone.

00:28:40.622 --> 00:28:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And quite honestly,
I was on a high speed

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
train headed for a
complete nervous breakdown.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Then another change showed up
for my daughter who said, mom,

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.520 align:middle line:84%
instead of trying to
put your life together

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
among the shards
of this disaster,

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.690 align:middle line:84%
why don't we do
something different?

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we move to Paris?

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So 12 weeks later, I found
myself in the City of Lights.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.150 align:middle line:84%
All my problems
with me, to be sure.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:90%
But also brand new possibility.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
A new language, a new
culture, new customs.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.960 align:middle line:90%
It was difficult, exciting.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.805 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.805 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:90%
It was embarrassing.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:30.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was mesmerizing.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But most of all,
it was liberating.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I found myself becoming
who I really wanted to be

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:90%
and knew me.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:90%
I changed my mind about change.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.790 align:middle line:84%
We all will face it in
some form or another.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:90%
But we have choices.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:84%
It can be seen as a crisis or
as an invitation from the soul.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.680 align:middle line:84%
You can run away,
or you can lean in.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:90%
I leaned in.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
was I was waking up

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:90%
in this incredible place.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, waking up an
incredible me that I did not

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.460 align:middle line:90%
even know existed.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:10%
That's what change
brought about.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And what better place to
discover that than to be

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.015 align:middle line:90%
waking up in Paris?

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:18.292 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:18.292 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a beautiful city.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.518 align:middle line:84%
But for those of us who can't
go to Paris, where do we go?

00:30:31.518 --> 00:30:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well,
see, I think Paris

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:84%
is a metaphor for
the part of you

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't been
beautiful enough.

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Go to the things that
bring you beauty.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Go to the things
that nourish you.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Go to the things that
bring you color, and art,

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and inspiration, and
that take you out

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:84%
of the ugliness
of whatever it is

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:90%
that you're resurrecting from.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the beauty.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's go back
to the feminine.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Go back to loving yourself.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
But surround yourself,
not just with thoughts,

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:84%
because I think thoughts
slip off like eggs on Teflon.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.240 align:middle line:90%
They don't really stick.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Experiences.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Your Paris can be a bubble bath.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Or your Paris could be
a major foot massage.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nature.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Or
nature, and flowers,

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:22.363 align:middle line:90%

is beautiful for you.

00:31:31.462 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:84%

had that satchel of anger

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.140 align:middle line:90%
on your back when you got there.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Anger is
my tool of a warrior.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Underneath, it was heartbreak.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Underneath it I had to face
things like, I'm not wanted,

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm rejected, I'm not
loved, I'm not good enough.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much I accomplish
in the world, I'm a fraud.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:84%
All that lovely bag of
tricks that that was what

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:90%
was under the anger.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I had negotiated
out of that by trying so hard.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I just
had to sit with it.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Those are parts of
the human brain.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What'd you do
when you sat with it?

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Oh,
drank a lot of coffee

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:90%
and ate a lot of croissants.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And realized it
wouldn't kill me.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of walks.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And realized it wasn't true.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And that there was a
part of my conditioning

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:90%
that was hard to shake.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So I made peace with it, but
realized all those thoughts,

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:39.330 align:middle line:84%
don't try to talk to them
because they will never listen.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn
to ignore them.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.180 align:middle line:90%
They're lies.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to say, no, I am
good enough because I did this,

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:46.950 align:middle line:90%
and I did that.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
where I was pissed.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:90%
Like, wait a minute.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.950 align:middle line:90%
I did all the things.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.180 align:middle line:90%
I did the forgiveness.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:90%
And I did the pilgrimage.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And I walked that
pilgrimage two times.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Enough.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:90%
So that was the pissed part.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But underneath,
it was like, what?

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:90%
What's going to shut you up?

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.700 align:middle line:90%
What part of my brain--

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.760 align:middle line:84%
what do I need to get
that part of my brain

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that tells me all
the time I'm not OK?

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.288 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
I'll never shut up.

00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I just have to quit
paying attention to it.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you hear
the dog barking next door.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:84%
You could think for awhile,
when am I going to get that dog.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, it's just,
that's just the dog barking.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And you move on.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I moved on.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then all of a sudden
you don't hear it anymore.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I stopped
being afraid of it.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I stopped thinking it was
important to listen to.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I realize it's part of my
human ego animal's self.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not part of my soul.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.105 align:middle line:90%
I made peace with it.

00:33:46.105 --> 00:33:47.940 align:middle line:84%

a huge part of my life

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.690 align:middle line:90%
that's been running.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
it's this past life too.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:90%
The gypsy soul in me.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:90%
The nomad in me.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:32.730 align:middle line:84%
The running, running, running
to find enlightenment in me

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:90%
was still running.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And it even ran the
second Camino to Paris.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it ran around
Paris about 8,000 times.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And then finally
I stopped running.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.939 align:middle line:90%
And that is the big waking up.

00:34:46.939 --> 00:34:47.739 align:middle line:90%
I stopped running.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:90%

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.920 align:middle line:90%
What's it like to stop running?

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It's relaxing.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.420 align:middle line:90%
It has kept me--

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:90%
I've changed.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not possessed
by work anymore.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:90%

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Nope.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not planning.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't have an identity.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's OK.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Ram Dass once said, you
know you're growing when

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:14.800 align:middle line:90%
you're willing to be nobody.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm kind of
in nobody's zone right now.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I listen with my whole
body for guidance.

And I got tell you something.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just in a
state of listening.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I haven't arrived
at some great--

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm still in it.

00:35:40.058 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I was
identified with my work.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.100 align:middle line:90%
I was identified as a teacher.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.375 align:middle line:84%
I was identified as a

00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:84%

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Confusing.

this really that where

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.150 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to get to?

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.020 align:middle line:90%

>>CHOQUETTE: And

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.710 align:middle line:84%
At least I can
enjoy my dinner now.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not racing
off to the next thing.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think a lot.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How are you
with being alone?

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I love it.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be alone forever.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I'll ever
have another relationship.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I wonder who will show
up to that relationship.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Because who I've been
is all dissolved.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:32.530 align:middle line:90%
It's like the chrysalis.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the muck of--

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
the caterpillar
hasn't taken off yet.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.870 align:middle line:90%
But I like being alone.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.330 align:middle line:90%
I grow up in a family of seven.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I married a man who
was one of nine.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I never even had my own name.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.960 align:middle line:90%
I was named after my mom.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:90%
This is new for me.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Until I was an adult, I
referred to myself as "we."

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I was one of the kids.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.270 align:middle line:90%
So this alone thing is--

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:90%
it's OK.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.330 align:middle line:90%

And it's surprisingly--

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.090 align:middle line:90%
I like myself.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.598 align:middle line:84%

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I like
my sense of living

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.930 align:middle line:84%
to the edges and willingness
to have the experience

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:84%

about the messiness of it all.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what I like, that I am
the naked person in the room.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm OK with that.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to be
naked all the time?

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:33.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm shy.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm low key.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Private.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm OK to be naked anyway.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know,
you have boundaries.

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:46.330 align:middle line:84%

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Definitely.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I feel able to
take care of myself

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:53.890 align:middle line:84%
with a real lack of
guilt and a real love

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't have
and didn't gain

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:84%
in either my Catholic experience
or my spiritual training.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Even spirituality,
until very recently,

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.190 align:middle line:90%
has been very patriarchal.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For you.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: It has been.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.750 align:middle line:84%
You're still
rewarded for pulling

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:13.320 align:middle line:84%
the rabbit out of your hat
and manifesting the goal.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.400 align:middle line:84%
You're never applauded
for hurting, or grieving,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.270 align:middle line:90%
or saying I don't know.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.720 align:middle line:10%
In fact, a lot of
people said to me,

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.480 align:middle line:10%
even my spiritual compadres,
have said, wow, what happened?

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were
a spiritual teacher.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:90%
You're psychic.

I feel like my

laugh when it's really tough.

or say go to Paris.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.100 align:middle line:84%

We have the divine

And I'm even ambivalent about
calling it mother father

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.820 align:middle line:10%
because it makes us
feel like children

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't let us grow up.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:84%
to let go where it's painful,
how do you ask the guides?

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.440 align:middle line:90%
You don't even know to ask for.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.300 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea
how to ask for it.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I have
one, a great way to ask.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.500 align:middle line:90%
This is the way I was taught.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.290 align:middle line:90%
And this is what serves me.

00:47:56.290 --> 00:48:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Every day I wake up and I say,
divine spirit and all helpers.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Move me.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Move my mind.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Move my heart.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Move my belly.

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Move my body in the direction
of my highest and greatest good.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:12.590 align:middle line:90%
And I say that out loud.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Move me.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.278 align:middle line:90%
And it moves you.

00:48:16.278 --> 00:48:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even though you have a
day planned or whatever it is.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: And you know what.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.940 align:middle line:84%
If someone calls me in the
middle of my day and says,

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:22.930 align:middle line:90%
let's move to Paris.

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:25.132 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK.

00:48:25.132 --> 00:48:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Move me.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.240 align:middle line:90%
And that is the prayer.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Move my mind so that
I'm open to things that

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:31.850 align:middle line:90%
are different than my plans.

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Move my emotions
so I let go of what

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm suffering to be
delighted by something new.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:43.507 align:middle line:84%
Move my body because gosh knows
I might be stuck and attached

00:48:43.507 --> 00:48:44.590 align:middle line:90%
to what isn't good for me.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And that is my guide prayer.

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, did it
help that you moved out

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.245 align:middle line:90%

00:48:51.245 --> 00:48:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Totally.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even if you're with
a loved one, and the loved

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.410 align:middle line:84%

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: When you're ready.

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:02.290 align:middle line:90%
When you're ready, move.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Whatever will help
you find your peace.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I needed to move because I'm
a very deeply loyal person.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:14.790 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't move, I would
be still grieving the past.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.490 align:middle line:90%
I am a committed, deep person.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So unless I was given a
new template for my life,

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.330 align:middle line:84%
a new place to let
new parts of me come,

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.113 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I would
have done as well.

>>LISA: If you stayed.

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: So I do tell
people when they say,

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.200 align:middle line:90%
oh, I wish I could.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.810 align:middle line:90%
I say, why not?

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I also am not much of an
attached to stuff person.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
I'm grateful for.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a Romanian
thing because I notice

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:45.640 align:middle line:90%
this in my Romanian family.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.640 align:middle line:84%
If you say, oh, I like
that picture on the wall,

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.780 align:middle line:84%
they'll take it
off and give it to.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So I think I have
a bit of that grace

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:54.550 align:middle line:90%
because I gave away everything.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did.

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I have
two racks of clothes,

a table, and a coffee table.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.693 align:middle line:84%

And cars.

And I had all that.

And my rationale
was, well, I had it.

Didn't do that much for me.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So let's see what it
feels like to not have.

>>LISA: Been there, done that.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.020 align:middle line:90%

That's why I knew when my
husband said no, I could

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.610 align:middle line:90%
have talked him into staying.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm persuasive.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I could have talked
him into not.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:01.570 align:middle line:84%
But I knew, on a soul
level, he's right.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:03.820 align:middle line:90%
He's right.

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:04.872 align:middle line:90%
We need to let go.

00:54:04.872 --> 00:54:06.580 align:middle line:84%
We need to go our
separate ways and learn

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.340 align:middle line:90%
our own separate lessons.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And I can't make
him wrong for that.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.450 align:middle line:90%
That was very hard for me.

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But his courage was greater
than mine in that moment.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's your biggest
teaching right now for people?

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.270 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOQUETTE: My biggest
teaching is don't judge yourself

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:30.510 align:middle line:10%
or others because you're judging
from a biased point of view.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:33.220 align:middle line:90%
You don't have the whole story.

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.942 align:middle line:90%
And you never will.

00:54:34.942 --> 00:54:37.010 align:middle line:90%
So just try to love yourself.

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And you'll not love others
if you don't love yourself.

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:42.020 align:middle line:90%
You'll just be faking it.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.520 align:middle line:90%
So one step at a time.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This self
care that you're into

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.040 align:middle line:84%
isn't just a matter of
getting the day spa and that.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: No.

00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It's about loving you
messy, loving you angry,

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:57.920 align:middle line:84%
loving you heartbroken,
loving you arrogant,

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.230 align:middle line:84%
knowing that that's
just your human self.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:06.690 align:middle line:84%
But your essence that's behind
all this experience is wholly.

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So just don't make
it conditional.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And do know there's a bunch
of you you won't like.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.858 align:middle line:84%
And certainly
others won't either.

00:55:14.858 --> 00:55:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: When you get to--

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Still
love yourself.

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --just don't judge
yourself in that place

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:18.650 align:middle line:90%
though, right?

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:20.067 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Don't
judge yourself.

00:55:20.067 --> 00:55:21.290 align:middle line:90%
It only makes it worse.

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:22.282 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:55:22.282 --> 00:55:23.240 align:middle line:90%
You can get stuck easy.

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: We're all that.

00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the advantage I have
as an intuitive guide

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:28.368 align:middle line:90%
is I know I'm not alone.

00:55:28.368 --> 00:55:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But we're all that way.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.452 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I talk to
people all the time.

00:55:31.452 --> 00:55:32.420 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same.

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.230 align:middle line:90%
We're all human beings.

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.620 align:middle line:90%
The human journey is that.

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:40.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of it is going
to be rotten to the core,

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and judge, and mad, and you
didn't do what I wanted,

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and however that plays out.

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But that's a part that
dies when your body dies.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not who you are.

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just what I call
your barking dog.

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.140 align:middle line:90%
It's your pet.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Your companion brain.

00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:58.440 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to protect you.

00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.430 align:middle line:90%
And it barks a lot.

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But our spirit, the light in our
eyes, it's pretty miraculous.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Even in all the moments where
people really made me mad,

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I have to admire there's a
spirit behind there creating

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.580 align:middle line:90%
all this.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And I love that spirit.

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
wonderful tool to let

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:25.620 align:middle line:84%
go of judgment and feeling
like taking it personal.

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: For real.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:29.220 align:middle line:90%
To really let go of.

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you just
tell us, and we're

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.130 align:middle line:84%
going to end with
this, but I want

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:36.330 align:middle line:84%
you to tell us how
does it feel to teach

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:38.220 align:middle line:90%
people to use their intuition?

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.055 align:middle line:90%
Do they really get it?

00:56:40.055 --> 00:56:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: When
I teach them, I

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:43.330 align:middle line:84%
give them very
little information

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:46.140 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of engagement.

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I have learned to
create experiences

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:52.470 align:middle line:84%
where the only place to
reach is your intuition.

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:54.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to find the answer

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to whatever challenge you're
in any other department of who

00:56:58.590 --> 00:56:59.390 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like, what
type of exercise?

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Well, I
will give him an exercise

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:06.470 align:middle line:90%
like playing I wonder.

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:08.940 align:middle line:84%
That's my favorite
game and easy.

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are, I
know, I know, I know.

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:11.640 align:middle line:90%
But I wonder.

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.630 align:middle line:84%
The minute you say I wonder,
you go to your intuitive brain.

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Just, even say the words.

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I wonder.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I wonder.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.690 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:18.110 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Do you notice that?

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.095 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden you're not
talking, you're listening.

00:57:21.095 --> 00:57:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're curious.

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Right.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So I play this
game where we have

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:26.600 align:middle line:90%
to wonder about each other.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.730 align:middle line:90%
But your ego can't play.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:31.020 align:middle line:90%
You have to name your spirit.

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.240 align:middle line:90%
So my spirit is bright light.

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.840 align:middle line:90%
So what would yours be?

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Shining star.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: OK.

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.473 align:middle line:90%
See how fun that is?

00:57:37.473 --> 00:57:38.273 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is fun.

00:57:38.273 --> 00:57:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE:
Different from Lisa.

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:42.690 align:middle line:84%
You have access to a
whole other dimension.

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Then we sit in a circle, and
we wonder about each other.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if you're going
to go to Italy this year.

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So your answer to
me is I wonder.

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:52.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you know?

00:57:52.845 --> 00:57:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Are you?

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Oh, I love that.

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a little intuitive.

00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's awesome.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: That's funny.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.238 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's awesome.

00:58:01.238 --> 00:58:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: But the
intuitive part of me,

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.580 align:middle line:84%
when I go to wonder,
that's what comes in.

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:09.180 align:middle line:84%
If I were to figure it
out, I'd never get that.

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And we wonder about each
other with nobody getting

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.050 align:middle line:90%
to say you're right or wrong.

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:14.780 align:middle line:90%
You just get to say, I wonder.

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So you learn to be in
this space that's playful.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're available to insight
dropping in instead of thinking

00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:23.960 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
great piece too--

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:26.075 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: So there you go.

00:58:26.075 --> 00:58:28.158 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --because I haven't
made the trip to Italy

00:58:28.158 --> 00:58:30.560 align:middle line:84%
yet because it's such a
burden to get on the airline

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.430 align:middle line:90%
and use the mileage.

00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But if I just wondered
how can I make this fun.

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I wonder.

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I wonder.

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That opens up so
many more possibilities.

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Don't
you feel like all

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:44.778 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden you've gone from
black and white to color?

00:58:44.778 --> 00:58:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The world's your stage.

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yes.

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So I play a lot of
games like that.

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.830 align:middle line:90%
People are so happy.

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Look how happy you are.

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:55.820 align:middle line:84%
You shift to your spirit,
so then you're happy.

00:58:55.820 --> 00:59:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You're in an energy
of availability.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.400 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden
you can be informed.

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.240 align:middle line:10%
You can be guided when you go
through the door of my heart.

00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.250 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And if things
happen, then you say, hmm,

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:08.360 align:middle line:10%
that's curious.

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's maybe try this.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.457 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Try this.

00:59:10.457 --> 00:59:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And your whole brain
set changes like that.

00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:14.510 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I teach.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't talk.

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:17.000 align:middle line:90%
You play.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:18.120 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:18.920 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.408 align:middle line:84%
What is your biggest reason for
being the teacher who you are?

00:59:23.408 --> 00:59:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: I thought
about that question.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think the answer
is it's creative.

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.992 align:middle line:90%
It's like intuitive improv.

00:59:29.992 --> 00:59:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I never know where
we're going to end up.

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:34.560 align:middle line:90%


00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.390 align:middle line:90%
I have no agenda.

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:36.620 align:middle line:90%
I've never gone with notes.

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm going to teach.

00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:43.255 align:middle line:84%
I just show up and do it in the
moment and see what happens.

00:59:43.255 --> 00:59:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With
thousands of people.

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: Thousands of
people around the world.

00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, I did last year in China.

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I wonder
if it'll work in China.

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.000 align:middle line:90%
And it worked in China.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.407 align:middle line:84%
Because human nature,
the human spirit--

00:59:55.407 --> 00:59:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is the same.

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: --is the same.

00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:59.737 align:middle line:90%
And I trust that.

00:59:59.737 --> 01:00:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the
same wherever you go.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: I trust it.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I trust it wholeheartedly.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so cool.

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:06.950 align:middle line:10%
You teach people to play.

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:07.220 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOQUETTE: Yeah.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.210 align:middle line:10%
I do.

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.600 align:middle line:10%
I do.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.410 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That's fun.

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.240 align:middle line:10%
>>CHOQUETTE: And it is fun.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.483 align:middle line:10%
So I'm never bored at work.

01:00:13.483 --> 01:00:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can imagine.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOQUETTE: And it's
a good distraction

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.740 align:middle line:90%
when I'm suffering, to play.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.305 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We've
learned so much here.

01:00:20.305 --> 01:00:21.680 align:middle line:84%
We've learned that
life is messy.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.000 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be that way.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.352 align:middle line:90%
You can reinvent yourself.

01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But the best way to do that is
through using your intuition

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and play.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: And play.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And to love your pain as much
as you love your victories.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:36.375 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Sonia.

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:37.333 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOQUETTE: Thank you.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.690 align:middle line:90%

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:41.480 align:middle line:10%
