>>LISA GARR: Imagine living
for two and a half years

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:84%
eating only edible ground plants
in a teepee in the Ozarks.

That's what my next guest
and leading herbalist

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:84%
did when she grew up with
over 50 years of experience

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:84%
as a nutritional consultant
of natural health.

14 books and teaches

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, and master
herbalist Brigitte Mars

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:10%
is here to share her vast
knowledge of living close

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:10%
to the earth and a few very
special recipes, as well.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.058 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGITTE MARS: Thank
you so much, Lisa.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love your
knowledge-- your vast knowledge

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and
the plants on it.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.550 align:middle line:84%
What drew you to this,
this incredible resource

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
that we have right
underneath our feet?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: I was really
blessed to have

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful French
Canadian grandmother,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't call
herself an herbalist,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:90%
but she was definitely wise.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.309 align:middle line:10%
And I remember one time
walking in the woods with her.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:10%
She knew the names
of all the plants,

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:10%
and we found this little wounded
bird, and she picked it up.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And we brought it home, and
she fed it some special herbs

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and put salve on it, and a few
days later it could fly away.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I must have
been three or four,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:84%
but I said I want to
be able to do that.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in
the '50s, and so it

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of injections
and antibiotics,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and I really preferred the
remedies of my grand-mere,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.060 align:middle line:90%
as I called her.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Apple cider vinegar
and honey or peppermint tea.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother's
idea of ice cream

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.159 align:middle line:84%
was to put maple syrup
that we made on snow,

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and there was this
connection to the Earth,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and it really seemed like
something out of a fairy tale,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and really medicine
for the people.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
It made all the
sense in the world

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:90%
that we should all know this.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, how far have
we gotten away from it?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's how people have
lived for thousands of years.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything that we
shouldn't already know to do,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.282 align:middle line:90%
but it's been undone.

00:02:21.282 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:10%
>>MARS: It's been
undone, and I sometimes

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:10%
think we've been bamboozled
a bit, because we think

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.020 align:middle line:10%
that all our food needs
to come from the store,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:10%
needs to have a package,
directions, a barcode.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And one atrocity,
Lisa, is that we

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
are using a third of
our nation's water

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
to water grass, which, unless
you're a cow or a goat,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.847 align:middle line:90%
you're probably not eating.

00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
really going to have

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:90%
to rethink how we use water.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
A proverb I heard years ago
that I really took to heart

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is, if you have water to throw
away, throw it on a plant.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And this whole idea
that we're going

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
to have a lawn that is suitable
for nothing except maybe

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.385 align:middle line:84%
croquet or something, which is
really an old school paradigm--

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to be
thinking about creating

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:90%
more edible lawns.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to
do that, we would

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
find that our lawns
would proliferate

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of plants that we
could use as food and medicine.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Edible lawns--
that is a great idea.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
the pesticides out,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
and the gophers sure love them.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have some of the
healthiest gophers in my house,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
but this is a very
important topic.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I live in California,
where it is getting so dry,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's evident because
of the wildfires.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Colorado, as well.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Every summer it's almost
like the whole state

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
goes into a blaze, and it goes
through December, Brigitte.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's breaking my
heart, and I don't

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:90%
know how I can contribute.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
As I travel up the
5 freeway, there's

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:84%
all these signs about water wars
and all of these different--

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a huge problem.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.804 align:middle line:84%
We take for granted
we can open the tap.

00:03:58.804 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And I don't know
if that privilege is always

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:90%
going to be with us.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't either.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: When I see so much
development, and population

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
increase, and that we just
flush the amount of water

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that a family in a developing
nation might use in a daytime,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and we do it over
and over again.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:90%
So the idea of an edible lawn--

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
the plants that are
considered weeds

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
are often really hardy, because
when we take a walk in nature,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:90%
nobody watered those plants.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Nobody fertilized them.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Nobody mulched them.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
They are survivors,
and in herbal medicine,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:84%
there's this beautiful
philosophy called

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:90%
the doctrine of signatures.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
ancient philosophy

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that you see in
India, and China,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and Native American
tradition, European.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And it talks about
that plants tell us

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
what they're good for
by the way they look,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:90%
and it sounds a bit folkloric.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: But cauliflower
really is good for the brain,

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and hijiki seaweed really
is good for the hair.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.335 align:middle line:84%
Blueberries are really
good for the eyes.

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Kidney beans are really
good for the kidneys.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So weeds are survivors, and
they're going to help us adapt.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Survive.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: We need to
start eating plants that

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:84%
have adaptive survival skills,
because we are putting way

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
too much emphasis on plants
that are very water intensive

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.691 align:middle line:84%
and take a lot of
energy to grow.

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Overconsumption is also
another issue I want to talk

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:10%
with you about, because as we've
seen, the inorganic fruits--

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:10%
they're losing their
color because they're

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle line:10%
so overproduced, and they are
under ripe when they're picked.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.144 align:middle line:84%
They're shipped, and
they're frozen sometimes,

00:05:40.144 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
put into shelves,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.754 align:middle line:84%
and they've already been
off the vine for two weeks.

00:05:45.754 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're not only
eating food that

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.836 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have anywhere
near the nutrients

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that it had in the
'50s, when you grew up,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
but we're eating food
that is spoiling quickly,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and the color is gone.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Tell us the history.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Well, think about this.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Very often, when
we have a salad,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:84%
how long was that lettuce, or
kale, or spinach in the ground?

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So what I feel is that, if we
were to make salad from things

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:90%
that were growing in our yard--

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
lamb's quarter,
dandelion greens,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
things that were
maybe growing 5,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes before we eat them--

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
the amount of life
force that we could

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
imbibe from that really makes
you feel like a superhuman.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people are tired.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:90%
They're lethargic.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:90%
They're medicated.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:90%
They feel foggy, soggy, groggy.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying,
let's go for things

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
that make us feel that we
have elevated life force

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and elevated chi, and that's
something I think we're going

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
to get from learning more about
the plants that are available,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:90%
that are saying, use me.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Use me lots.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm abundant.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm not being over bred.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Edible flowers-- how do you
know which ones are edible?

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it the more color?

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Can you always eat pansies?

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.851 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, we
certainly don't want

00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to eat flowers that come
from a florist shop.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Very often they're imported
from other continents even.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
They could be using
chemicals that are even

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:90%
banned in the United States.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We certainly don't want to
eat inorganic flowers, which

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:84%
might also be something you
get from a florist shop.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So growing your own flowers or
supporting those companies that

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
are present at the
farmer's market--

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:84%
there's certainly
a lot of them--

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
no, you can't really
rely on color.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a book called
"Rawsome" that

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:90%
has a list of over 150 flowers.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:84%
There are some flowers
that are very poisonous,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:90%
like Lily of the Valley.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Roses are edible, but if
they're sprayed with pesticides,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:90%
then they're toxic.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But things like nasturtiums,
and marigold, day lilies,

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
the traditional
hemerocallis vulva--

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:90%
you can't eat all the hybrids.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.024 align:middle line:84%
All of the mint
flowers are edible.

00:07:58.024 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's the kind
of thing you need

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:90%
to learn which ones are edible.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Pansies are edible, and
their wild relative violets

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:90%
are edible.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:84%
If they're organic,
and you've eaten them--

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:84%
however, African violets
are in a different family,

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.955 align:middle line:84%
so African violets
are not edible.

00:08:14.955 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Really purple ones,
like the color of your dress.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: But it could be pink,
or red, or yellow pansies,

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So pansies and
violets are wonderful,

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and I just made
a violet vinegar.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.385 align:middle line:84%
I put violets in white vinegar,
and it made a purple vinegar.

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:90%
And it was just glorious.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:90%
So you reminded me of a story.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.219 align:middle line:84%
I had just moved into a house,
and there was this really large

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:39.019 align:middle line:90%
piece of furniture.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a large pine
piece of furniture,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and I reached on the top
of it, and I accidentally

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:90%
pulled it onto myself.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It toppled onto
me, and it landed

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:90%
in the inside of my calf.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:90%
And nobody was around.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I scooted myself
out to the yard,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and I found this
beautiful red rose.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.625 align:middle line:90%
I ate the whole thing.

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I just instinctively--
I was in so much pain,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:90%
and I ate this incredible rose.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't break a bone.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It barely bruised.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a giant
pine piece of furniture.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how that
happened, but it was right

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:90%
where I migrated towards.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
It was this gorgeous-- it
was just there to say to me,

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:90%
I will heal you.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:90%
And it spoke to me.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Do flowers have that level of
vibration to heal that much?

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, if you think
about flowers botanically,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:84%
they are the sex
organs of plants,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and they are really
quite powerful.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
They're designed to
attract pollinators

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:90%
with their fragrance.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
They can detract predators
also with their fragrance.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:84%
They often have all kinds
of essential oils in them

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
which have anti-microbial
properties.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And rose indeed is very
hydrating to the skin.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a traditional folk remedy
for healing a broken heart.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:10%
We know that rose hips are
really high in bioflavonoids--

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:10%
the fruit from the
rose, which does

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:10%
strengthen the capillaries.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But roses have a long tradition
of being used not only in food.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Rose water is used a lot in
many cultures in cuisine.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Essentially the oils--

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
of the rose oil is so beautiful
that when you press it

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and you really get
that oil there--

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.334 align:middle line:84%
it's a-- I have a large
affinity with roses,

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
but it's everywhere,
like you mentioned.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:10%
The orange blossoms-- we
have the zucchini flowers.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:10%
They're everywhere.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And you just want to
learn which ones you can eat.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
almost a perception,

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
because maybe our parents
didn't know about plants,

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and we would pick something,
and they'd say, wash your hands.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Throw that away.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there are
some poisonous plants.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:10%
You wouldn't want to make a
centerpiece with poison ivy,

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.100 align:middle line:10%
or ingest poison hemlock or
water hemlock, or death camas,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:10%
but there's just a
few poisonous plants,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:10%
and it's good to know
which ones are poisonous.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think before you
ingest any plant, whether it

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:84%
be for food or a tea, that
you really need to be sure,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and make sure it's not collected
within a polluted area--

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:84%
usually at least 50 feet
away from a busy road,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and make sure you have
the right species and not

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:90%
an endangered species.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So it takes some
level of learning,

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.681 align:middle line:84%
but what a valuable
thing to study.

00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, incredible.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: You feel
at home everywhere,

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and you feel like, oh,
I recognize my friends.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
You have lamb's quarter
here, or amaranth here,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and then sometimes I
see homeless people,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, give me money.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.717 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes say,
do you know you could

00:11:48.717 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:90%
eat that right behind you?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
We need never be hungry if
we know what is abounding.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is incredible.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's learn about our
gardens, about what we're

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.800 align:middle line:90%
walking on.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:10%
First of all, you
say that a lawn--

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:10%
we spend money to water
it, and then the mowers

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:10%
come and use gas to mow
it, and then the trash bags

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:10%
to fill the leaves.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.304 align:middle line:90%
Explain that cycle.

00:12:14.304 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's really get
aware about this.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: It's crazy.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think that this really is
another type of bamboozlement.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat your lawn.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:90%
People will let the apples--

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:84%
the organic apples
fall to the ground,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and then go to the store and
buy commercial apples that

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:90%
are from another continent.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:10%
So we need to change that,
and I have an article online

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:10%
that's called "Get
Off Your Grass

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:10%
and Create an Edible Lawn."

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:90%
So it was in "Huffington Post."

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And it has lots
of ideas on edible lawns.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So another thing we
want to keep in mind

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is that, when we do have
flowers in our yard, weeds,

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
this is food for
the pollinators,

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.900 align:middle line:84%
for the bees, and
the butterflies,

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%
and the hummingbirds.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So when we're just
growing grass,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:84%
there's no opportunity
for pollination,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and dandelions are actually
one of the first foods

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:90%
for the bees in the springtime.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:90%
So dandelions are not the enemy.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
They are actually something
that was brought here

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
to this continent
by the pioneers.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:90%
They're native to Eurasia.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
The pioneers put
fences around them

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to keep the deer
and the rabbits out.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The dandelion leaves you
can eat in the springtime.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
They're tastiest
before they flower,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
but they're high in
iron and potassium.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Dandelion leaves are
considered a supreme diuretic,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
so they help to get rid of
excess fluid in your body.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Most chemical diuretics
deplete the body of potassium,

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
but dandelion leaves
give you potassium.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:84%
The dandelion flowers
are high in lutein, which

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.340 align:middle line:90%
is really good for our eyes.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you can go to
the health food store

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:90%
and buy a bottle of lutein--

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
$20-- but we could be eating
the dandelion flowers.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I was just teaching in Iceland,
and the dandelions were really

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
long there, and we boiled
the stems like noodles.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.646 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Like two
minutes, and then

00:14:12.646 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
sauteed them with
garlic and coconut oil,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.712 align:middle line:90%
and that was so yummy.

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Like a pad Thai.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Like a
pad Thai, and then

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
you can eat the dandelion
root, or roast the root

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:90%
and make a coffee substitute.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.447 align:middle line:90%
So we have really been--

00:14:28.447 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Conditioned.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.113 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Conditioned to
think that dandelions

00:14:31.113 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
are the enemy when they
are such a useful plant.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
If I were going
to another planet,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I would want to have
dandelion seeds with me,

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:90%
because they grow easily.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:84%
They're here a month before
you can even plant the garden.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I think a yard
with dandelions is beautiful.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.840 align:middle line:10%
The little yellow flowers
that pop up-- it's gorgeous.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, our animals,
and our propagators of nature

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that they go
to those flowers first.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:90%
We should learn from them.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And we need to change
these home owner restrictions.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: These neighborhoods--
you can only grow grass,

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:90%
and it can only be this tall.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Because that might have
been something fashionable,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
but now we need to look
at, what is the future?

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:84%
How can we conserve our
water and use it wisely?

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And the dandelions actually
help aerate the soil,

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:84%
so having dandelions
in your yard

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:90%
is a good thing for the planet.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is the whole
concept of weed killer?

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And now we're finally starting
to see how-- well, we we've

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.719 align:middle line:84%
for a long time seen
how poisonous it is,

00:15:34.719 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
but it's finally starting to
get pulled off of shelves.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:10%
>>MARS: Well, I mean, after all,
we had Rachel Carson in 1962

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:10%
in her book "Silent
Spring" warning us

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:10%
about the effects of
spraying pesticides,

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:10%
and how it would kill the
insects, would kill the birds,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.047 align:middle line:10%
and that would increase
insect population,

00:15:51.047 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:10%
because we'd no
longer have the birds,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:10%
and it would poison the water.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:90%
So this is not news.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.080 align:middle line:84%
We've known this,
but we are constantly

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
being bombarded with
media that makes

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
us think that having
edibles in your yard

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:84%
was a sign of not
being affluent enough.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
If you had a
useless yard, people

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:84%
could drive by in
their carriages

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and say they must be so rich.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it became associated
with being maybe a lower class,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:84%
but now we have to
think about, how

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
are we going to feed all
the people on the planet?

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And having edible
lawns is a great start.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Use less gas.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Go pick your salad in your yard.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:90%
It's fresher.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
How many of us are
thinking about how can we

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
stretch our food dollars
to make them go longer?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And most of the so-called weeds
that come up in our garden

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:84%
are actually the ancestors
of cultivated plants.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You might hate
thistles, but they're

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
the ancestors of artichokes.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:84%
You might not
appreciate chicory,

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:84%
but they're the ancestors
of endive and escarole.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:10%
Lamb's quarter is wild spinach.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:10%
So why would we pull
that up out of the yard?

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going--

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.561 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is lamb's quarter?

00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:06.579 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Yeah, this is
lamb's quarter right here.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's wild spinach, and
people will work really hard

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
in their garden, in
the hot sun, sweating,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.760 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of this
plant, when it's

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:90%
more nutritious than spinach.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's offering
itself for free.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is what makes
everything so fragrant.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:84%
The flowers-- your wildflowers
growing around makes spring

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:90%
smell like spring.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful--
wow, that's great.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:90%
It reminds me of spring.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: So really it's time.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
We hear about raising
consciousness.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
want to do, and so

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
if we start with our
own little plot of land,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
whether it's our
balcony, or our porch,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:84%
or the front yard, or the
backyard, or the window sill,

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
but we can all grow something.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to get
your kids to eat healthier,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:84%
you get them to participate
in that miracle of growing

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't
like carrots before,

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
they're probably going to
like it once they grow them.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Once they
grow them, yes.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I was growing kale for a long
time, because I love kale,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
but my gophers liked
it more than me.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:90%
They got to it first.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
How do you suggest natural
pest control like that?

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.495 align:middle line:90%
Divert them to something else?

00:18:18.495 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MARS: Well, I think that
there is, at least for moles,

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.040 align:middle line:10%
and maybe they're
similar to gophers,

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:10%
but putting castor bean
seeds in the ground

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.390 align:middle line:10%
is said to deter them.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't have them here,
so it's been a long time

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
since I've had
that, but I remember

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:84%
that we would put
castor bean seeds

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and that somehow that
was diverting them.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.287 align:middle line:84%
Also planting enough so
there's enough for everybody.

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: I also think
you can do the Jedi

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
mind meld and let them know
we're not going to bother you.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
This is yours, and we want a
certain amount for ourselves,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and we can all coexist.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that there
are ways of communicating.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Maybe playing music.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe planting foods
that they don't like,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.917 align:middle line:84%
like garlic or onions
might deter them.

00:19:08.917 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think the other thing is
just plant so much that there's

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:90%
enough for everybody.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Natural pest
control, and that's

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.576 align:middle line:84%
what I was getting at-- is
there's a lot of different ways

00:19:17.576 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:84%
You make these great
recipes, and you have

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of fantastic videos.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:90%
I chose this one.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.184 align:middle line:90%
It's called the fruit whip.

00:19:24.184 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.907 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Hi, welcome to
my raw-some kitchen.

00:19:27.907 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm Brigitte Mars, and
I'm going to show you

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
how to make a simple,
antioxidant rich--

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I call it a fruit
whip, and it's going

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
to give you all the
colors of the rainbow

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:90%
and be super healthy, too.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I used to worry about how
many calories avocados were,

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
but avocados also
contain lecithin,

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and they also contain lipase, an
enzyme to help you digest fats.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, oranges are
a great source of vitamin C.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we are going
to add some weeds.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully you do not
spray herbicides in your yard

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
or never, never in
your garden, but this

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.780 align:middle line:84%
is something you to with
some of the extra greens

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
that offer themselves freely.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:84%
We have lemon balm here,
Melissa officinalis--

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:84%
wonderful for
helping one to focus.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Lemon balm is said to be
a remedy for depression.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:84%
We have some cleavers, which
are very lymphatic cleansing.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
We have an herb known
as stinging nettle,

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and you might say, well, don't
stinging nettles sting you?

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
They do, but if you blend them,
puree them, cook them, or dry

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:90%
them, they lose their sting.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And the infamous
dandelion leaf--

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:84%
dandelion leaves are
high in potassium,

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.630 align:middle line:90%
and they are diuretic.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
They're high in iron
and beta carotene,

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
and they do not kill the grass.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
They actually help
aerate the soil.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:10%
And lamb's quarter is
actually wild spinach--

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:10%
chenopodium album.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.539 align:middle line:84%
It's even more
nutritious than spinach.

00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have just a
little bit of mint.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:90%
That'll make it taste great.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So learn about the weeds
that grow in your yard.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Not only are they fresh,
because all these plants were

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
growing just about two minutes
ago, they're also free.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.270 align:middle line:10%
And this is a yellow dock,
rumex crispus, also very high

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:10%
in vitamin C and iron.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to add maybe a couple
of tablespoons of water just

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to help the blender
be a little happier,

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and turn my new
Waring blender on.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:90%
And voila.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:90%
You serve this in a bowl.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
You can decorate it with
some edible flowers.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I have here a pansy, but
you could add some raw cacao

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:90%
nibs, goji berries, some nuts.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is so delicious
it'll make you feel

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:90%
like a superhuman all day long.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for joining me, Brigitte
Mars, in the raw-some kitchen.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: First of all,
you said in there

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't
really at first want

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:84%
to use the avocado because
it was high in fat,

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:84%
but now avocados are
our biggest friend.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Tell me your relationship
with avocados.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, I saw this picture
on Facebook, and it an avocado

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
looking at himself in the
mirror saying, you're fat,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:90%
but you're good fat.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:90%
So I think that there's--

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
just like there's a lot
of types of carbohydrates,

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of types of fat.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So deep fried pork rinds are
not of the same vibration

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
as an avocado.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So another thing to keep
in mind about raw fats that

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
are in, say, nuts, and
seeds, and avocados

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is there's an enzyme
called lipase which

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.610 align:middle line:90%
helps you to digest fats.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Digest it.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And enzymes
get destroyed

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
when be heat things at a high
temperature-- over 118 degrees

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So avocados are great, and the
whole fat free thing is really

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:84%
so passe, because
we found that when

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
everybody ate fat free salad
dressing and fat free cookies

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that there was usually a lot
more sugar and salt in it,

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't
really satisfy you.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So fat is a carrier
of flavor, and I

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:84%
think it's really about
selecting the good kind of fats

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be supportive
to your nervous system

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and actually can help satisfy
you so you don't overeat.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a lot of
great research on how good

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:90%
fats are good for you.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a lot in the news
recently trying to debunk that,

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
saying that high fat diets
lead to high cholesterol.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that it's probably
big business and big pharma

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
behind that, but I'd love
to know from you if you know

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
any natural resourced
plants that are

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:90%
great for lowering cholesterol.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, sometimes
high cholesterol is genetic,

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.330 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it's not just
about what we eat, too.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's some vegetarians
that have high cholesterol,

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and there's people that eat
meat that have low cholesterol.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're also finding out that
cholesterol is not necessarily

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
the evil that it was
once brought to us,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that there's other
factors for heart health

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.760 align:middle line:84%
to consider, like
homocysteine levels,

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:84%
but if you're concerned about
cholesterol, eat less red meat.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Eat less dairy.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Eat less refined carbohydrates,
and help your liver

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to function better
by using herbs

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:84%
that stimulate bile
production, which is

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.290 align:middle line:90%
going to help metabolize fats--

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:90%
so things like dandelion root.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And another thing is
to use a little bit

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:90%
more the bitter flavor.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
As a culture, we're very
fixated on sweet and salty,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:84%
but when we use the sour flavor,
it helps to activate our liver.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:84%
When we use the
bitter flavor, it

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
has a special affinity for our
heart, our small intestines,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:90%
and the liver to some degree.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So eat a wide
variety of flavors.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And lemon and water helps
to fluidify the blood.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
When I have clients and they're
concerned about cholesterol,

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I suggest try eating a
couple tart apples a day.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.730 align:middle line:84%
What about drinking
lemon and water?

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:90%
It helps to fluidify the blood.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a
whole array of plants

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that are said to prevent blood
platelet aggregation, which

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:84%
is really a fancy term for
keeping our blood from clumping

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
together and getting
released sticky.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.576 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, isn't
that what statins do?

00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Yeah, garlic,
onions, cayenne pepper.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Those can all be allies that
we should use abundantly.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Not so much garlic bread.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, garlic is really more
medicinal in its raw form,

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:84%
so blend it into
your salad dressing.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.372 align:middle line:84%
Chop up the garlic
greens and add them

00:25:44.372 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:90%
to your salad dressing.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You could even put
them in your smoothies.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about thistles?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.042 align:middle line:84%
Milk thistle or other
stinging plants?

00:25:53.042 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about those.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:10%
>>MARS: Well, my
favorite stinging plant

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.867 align:middle line:10%
is stinging nettles,
which is an amazing plant.

00:25:58.867 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the
other plants I would

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:10%
bring with me if traveling
to a far distant world.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.160 align:middle line:10%
Rudolf Steiner said nettles
are the heart of the world,

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:10%
and they sting you, but the
sting actually injects you

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:10%
with something called formic
acid, and acetylcholine,

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:10%
and silicic acid.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may have heard of
bee sting therapy, where

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:84%
people that have arthritis
or MS get stung with bees.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, that formic acid
is what's in nettles.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:10%
It's also in bee stings
and red ant bites.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:10%
So getting stung with
nettles is actually

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:37.515 align:middle line:10%
really therapeutic
for arthritic joints.

00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I get stung with
nettles all the time

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.697 align:middle line:90%
when I'm mountain biking.

00:26:40.697 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, you won't
get arthritis there.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
really great to know,

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.216 align:middle line:84%
but I usually just
brush them off.

00:26:45.216 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:90%
I should keep-- they sting.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: But so stinging nettles,
yeah, they do sting you,

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
but when you dry nettles
or when you blend them up,

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.495 align:middle line:90%
they don't sting you.

00:26:54.495 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Or when you juice them.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can drink them?

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.791 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: I love to
drink nettle juice.

00:26:57.791 --> 00:27:00.630 align:middle line:84%
We drink nettle juice
probably from March

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.580 align:middle line:90%
until December at our house.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
We blend it up
and then strain it

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.037 align:middle line:84%
so you're not
ingesting the fibers.

00:27:06.037 --> 00:27:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The nettles.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: But it really
is a wonderful plant,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.299 align:middle line:90%
and we also know that nettles--

00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be
clear, because there

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:90%
are a lot of stinging plants--

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:90%
urtica dioica or urtica urens--

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.810 align:middle line:84%
they are actually
really high in iron.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you make a
tea of nettles, it

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.320 align:middle line:84%
strengthens the
kidneys and adrenals.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:84%
How many people are talking
about adrenal burnout

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:90%
and adrenal exhaustion?

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So nettles can help relieve some
of the symptoms of allergies.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Nettles is really
strengthening to our bones.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, women are concerned
about not getting osteoporosis

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:84%
later on, and nettles
made as an overnight tea

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.587 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful, delicious,
mineral rich brew.

00:27:48.587 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is the best thing
to do when we find herbs

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:90%
and flowers--

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:84%
is to steep them as a tea, or
to eat them, or to blend them,

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.220 align:middle line:84%
or is it just a
mixture of things?

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.325 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: It depends.

00:27:58.325 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nettles you're not
going to put in a salad.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
That would be cruel
to sting your mouth,

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:84%
but you could juice it,
and you could cook it.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.410 align:middle line:84%
You could make a nettle
soup, or if you blend it,

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:90%
it loses its sting.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But nettles might
be something that I

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:84%
used to make a quiche, or
nettle potato soup, or something

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.400 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:10%
But lamb's quarter--
I might use it raw

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.419 align:middle line:10%
because it's wild spinach,
and we use spinach raw.

00:28:26.419 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is more
of a general question,

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
but when you go and
get the teas that

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.470 align:middle line:84%
are in the bags in the pretty
packaging and so forth,

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:84%
how much of that
is really useful?

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Has it just been
dead for too long?

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Give us a little bit
of knowledge on this.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, I mean,
drinking herbal tea is great,

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and I am glad that
it is so convenient

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and that you can get herbal
tea at most restaurants now,

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:84%
but in actuality, in order
for tea to go into a bag,

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:84%
it has to be ground
up really fine

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to go into a tea
bagging machine.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And usually they just
have a very small amount--

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
about a teaspoon or
less than a teaspoon.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of herbal teas would
be even more medicinal if we

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:90%
were to let them steep longer--

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes minimum, but
I steep a lot of my herbs

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:90%
even overnight.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Does it open it up more?

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Yes, you get
more minerals from it.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's something called
an overnight infusion, where

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:29.640 align:middle line:84%
you put your-- maybe an inch
of dried herb in a Ball jar

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and then cover it to
the top with hot water.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A Ball jar?

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:34.310 align:middle line:90%
What's a--

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: A canning jar, a
Mason jar, any of those jars.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Put the lid on, and
let it sit overnight,

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and then the color
is even more vibrant,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
but, again, company comes
over, you don't say,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600 align:middle line:90%
can you spend the night?

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make us some tea.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.131 align:middle line:90%
Are you leaving in the morning?

00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be
everyone who comes over.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's
company's coming.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a cup of
tea in 10 minutes.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But I also like the
idea of supporting

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:84%
local her stores that have
herbs in a bigger cut.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Chefs know this.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
When we are using a culinary
herb like cardamom or cumin,

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.770 align:middle line:84%
if we want to be
an amazing chef,

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.250 align:middle line:84%
we're going to buy the whole
seed and grind it up fresh.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:84%
If you buy the powder
cumin or cardamom that

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:84%
was ground up two
years ago, maybe

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:84%
sitting in a spice
jar in your cupboard,

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.340 align:middle line:84%
the flavor is not going to be as
intense, because essential oils

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:90%
evaporate more quickly.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you recommend
grinding them in the--

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Yes.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I have a little
mortar and pestle.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:84%
That's an ancient
tool, the mortar

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
is said to symbolize
the feminine,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and the pestle is the masculine.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And my grandchildren love
the story of baba yaga.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
She's like this
Russian witch, and she

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:84%
flies in a mortar and pestle,
and she uses it to steer.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But so yes, I have
a mortar and pestle,

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.559 align:middle line:90%
but you could use your blender.

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I like that way better.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Or a little
coffee grinder.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.866 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Because
the stone probably

00:30:58.866 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:10%
also helps release
all those great aromas

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:10%
and break up the hulls.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: It does, and
I also feel like it's

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:84%
putting your intention into it,
and that's part of making food,

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me
about organic foods.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Why are they so
expensive in the markets?

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.259 align:middle line:84%
How can we really eat organic
without it being so ridiculous?

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, we
want to keep in mind

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.515 align:middle line:84%
that the cost of organic
foods is coming down as it's

00:31:26.515 --> 00:31:27.515 align:middle line:90%
becoming more available.

00:31:27.515 --> 00:31:28.315 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good.

00:31:28.315 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: But initially there
were just organic apples

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:90%
and organic carrots.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
That's all you could buy in
the '60s, and now there's--

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:84%
almost everything
you can get organic,

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.230 align:middle line:84%
but they're usually
done on a smaller scale,

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.657 align:middle line:90%
so the farms are not as large.

00:31:43.657 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that's
good because you're

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.680 align:middle line:90%
supporting smaller farms.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: But if we
support it, it's

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:90%
going to become more available.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing is grow
your own organic garden.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Farmer's markets
are also good things

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.080 align:middle line:84%
to support to also think
about buying things in season.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
You're going to buy organic
peaches when they're

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%
in season in your
state, and I'm going

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to wait for when they're
in season in my state,

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:84%
rather than I've got to have
them in May or something

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:90%
shipped from another continent.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think if we pay
attention to not only eating

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:90%
more local, but also seasonal--

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I was in Switzerland,
and this restaurant

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:90%
had 12 things on the menu.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:25.670 align:middle line:90%
It was early May.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:84%
They had asparagus
soup, asparagus salad,

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
asparagus souffle,
asparagus quiche,

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:90%
because that was in season.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we might
want to think about looking

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:90%
at what is happening right now.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the season that
you're in wherever you are.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:84%
What are some good starter
herbs to start your garden with?

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Some hardy starter herbs.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, a couple
that I think of--

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.748 align:middle line:84%
sometimes people are
worried that they're

00:32:50.748 --> 00:32:53.330 align:middle line:84%
going to take over, but
I say let them take over.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.860 align:middle line:90%
They're wonderful for the bees.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.680 align:middle line:10%
Lemon balm is a great one--

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.899 align:middle line:10%
Melissa officinalis.

00:32:58.899 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:10%
So if you know
someone named Melissa,

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:10%
you could say, oh, your
name means honey leaf.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And officinalis
means the official.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.850 align:middle line:90%
So lemon balm tastes good.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:09.650 align:middle line:90%
It's lemony.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a member of
the mint family.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It has long been considered
an antidepressant.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.081 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: You could
crush it up, put it

00:33:17.081 --> 00:33:19.490 align:middle line:84%
in your water bottle
or your water carafe.

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
super sturdy leaf.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: It is one of the
favorite foods of honeybees.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It's also really
good for the liver,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's also antiviral against
cold, and flu, and even herpes

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:90%
virus.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.230 align:middle line:84%
It's used a lot in European
medicine for topical creams,

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:41.150 align:middle line:84%
for even things like shingles
and cold sore outbreaks.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:90%
The other one is mint.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Both of these are perennials.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll come back
year after year.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Mint-- we think of mint.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:84%
We can only use it as tea, but
if you have an abundance of it,

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:84%
cut it, dry it in a paper bag,
give it to all your friends

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:90%
for winter tea.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:84%
It makes a nice
cooling summer bath.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you dry it?

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I have an out-of-control
mint plant.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, just cut it,
put it in a paper bag loosely,

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:84%
and ideally you want to cut it
when the plant is just starting

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:84%
to flower early in the day, not
when it's all tired and wilty

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:90%
at the end of a hot day.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And I usually just dry
them in a warm room.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.719 align:middle line:84%
So it could be the top floor,
or some people dry them

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:25.100 align:middle line:90%
in the backseat of the car.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.469 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
dry them in the sun.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Shade is better, because the sun
will cause the essential oils

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.460 align:middle line:90%
to evaporate.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And burn.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: I know we've all
seen the pioneer movies where

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.630 align:middle line:84%
they're hanging
from the rafters,

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
and you can do that, too,
but once they are dry,

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
you want to store
them in a glass jar,

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:84%
or come the time you're
about to use them,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.320 align:middle line:84%
they'll have spider webs on
them and stuff like that.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's very easy to dry herbs.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
People have been drying
herbs for thousands of years,

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and a loose paper
bag works great.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Another tip I'd love to know
is, when you do get produce,

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:84%
do you not put it
in the refrigerator?

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Some things need to be
refrigerated more than others,

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.544 align:middle line:84%
but I think we over
refrigerate things.

00:35:09.544 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know tomatoes
are not supposed

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:90%
to go in the refrigerator.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:13.448 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Yeah, and
a lot of things--

00:35:13.448 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:84%
it's sometimes
appropriate to look at,

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:18.027 align:middle line:84%
was it refrigerated
at the store?

00:35:18.027 --> 00:35:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But no, if you get
it from the farmer's market--

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.490 align:middle line:90%
like avocados should stay out.

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: But once they're ripe,
put them in the refrigerator,

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:90%
or they will continue to ripen.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.542 align:middle line:84%
So once your peaches are ripe,
put them in the refrigerator,

00:35:30.542 --> 00:35:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and they'll still be
good for a few days.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
let them sit there,

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.820 align:middle line:84%
they will get
overripe very quickly.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fast.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Same with tomatoes.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.545 align:middle line:90%
And lemons are pretty good.

00:35:40.545 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Lemons, potatoes you
don't usually need to ripen,

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:84%
but, again, they're usually
not refrigerated at the store.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.865 align:middle line:84%
And I've been using
a solar oven lately.

00:35:49.865 --> 00:35:50.914 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's that?

00:35:50.914 --> 00:35:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: I bought this
little solar oven.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I got them for everybody in
my family for the holidays,

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's a little
tube with reflectors,

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and I've been baking
little potatoes in the sun,

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.620 align:middle line:90%
or cauliflower in the sun.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.257 align:middle line:84%
And it's a small step to
being more sustainable.

00:36:06.257 --> 00:36:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And I don't have
solar panels on my house

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.390 align:middle line:84%
because I live in a
condo, and hopefully

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that will come someday,
but if we could just

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.870 align:middle line:84%
take some small steps
to going more solar,

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:17.865 align:middle line:90%
a solar oven is great.

00:36:17.865 --> 00:36:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't
heat your kitchen up

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:20.840 align:middle line:90%
when the weather's hot.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I love to use a lot of raw food.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I do eat a high
percentage of raw food,

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.190 align:middle line:84%
but the idea that we could
be cooking with the sun--

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is great.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.379 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: It feels
like it's putting--

00:36:30.379 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just it's that long?

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not that long?

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.598 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: It's that long.

00:36:33.598 --> 00:36:34.590 align:middle line:90%
It's like a long tube.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you could
put potatoes and--

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Potatoes.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:37.770 align:middle line:90%
I've done cauliflower.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:39.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it work
like a dehydrator or no?

00:36:39.645 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: No, it
makes things juicy.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:10%
It steams.

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Although if you left
things in it too long,

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.960 align:middle line:84%
it probably would dehydrate
things eventually,

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.456 align:middle line:90%
but it's not a dehydrator.

00:36:49.456 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you don't
have a dehydrator,

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:90%
can you also use an oven?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, an oven
doesn't have a fan

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:90%
to blow the moisture out.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.410 align:middle line:90%
So I just want to share this.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:84%
When I lived in the teepee in
the Ozarks, for most of it,

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.130 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have electricity.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:08.234 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to dehydrate
food for the winter,

00:37:08.234 --> 00:37:10.150 align:middle line:84%
because what are we going
to eat in the winter

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:84%
when there's snow
covering the ground?

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So for some reason, we had a
trampoline on the property,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.297 align:middle line:84%
and I would lay sliced peaches,
and blackberries, and things--

00:37:19.297 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: On the trampoline.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: On the trampoline.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd cover it with lace
to repel the flies

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:90%
so they couldn't land on it.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And then in many
parts of the country,

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.110 align:middle line:84%
the dew comes, and everything
gets really moist at night.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.507 align:middle line:84%
So at night, I would
bring it back inside.

00:37:34.507 --> 00:37:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a brilliant idea.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And then I
would take it back out,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.583 align:middle line:84%
and they'd be dry
in a couple of days.

00:37:38.583 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when they're dry,
you label them and put them

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
in a glass jar, and you
have food for the winter.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's so easy.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.982 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you want
to make an apple pie.

00:37:47.982 --> 00:37:49.690 align:middle line:84%
You just soak it in
water, and now you've

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.440 align:middle line:84%
got nice, juicy,
moist apples again.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is amazing.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:84%
You were that creative
when you were a teenager.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.185 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Necessity is
the mother of invention.

00:37:59.185 --> 00:38:01.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, how
are we going to do this?

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And I really held in
high esteem the people

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that had lived on this
continent before we got here.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:14.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't go to the
store or have a dehydrator.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:90%
People smoked things.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:90%
They used the sun energy.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.210 align:middle line:90%
They used the wind.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
going to need to start

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.660 align:middle line:84%
doing that more to save energy,
and also to be more empowered,

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and to unplug more from
corporate companies that

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.070 align:middle line:90%
are polluting our planet.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And not to
support that level.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:36.880 align:middle line:84%
This is Brigitte on a nature
walk, and look what she finds.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Welcome.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm Brigitte Mars, and I'm here
on the beautiful campus of Gaia

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.520 align:middle line:10%
outside Boulder, Colorado.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.892 align:middle line:10%
And there are so many plants
just within a few yards.

00:38:48.892 --> 00:38:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to just take
a little walk around here

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and see how you
might incorporate

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.960 align:middle line:84%
some of these wild
plants into your life.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:84%
One plant that most people
don't appreciate is the thistle.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
varieties of thistle.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Scotch thistle, bull
thistle, elk thistle.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Thistles are a member of
the asteraceae family.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.530 align:middle line:84%
They're actually a relative
of lettuce and sunflower,

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.070 align:middle line:84%
but they're a very, very
close relative of artichokes.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.360 align:middle line:90%
They're the ancestor.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.610 align:middle line:84%
In the springtime
with a pair of gloves,

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.650 align:middle line:84%
you could pull the thistle
up, and there's an edible root

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:25.450 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.866 align:middle line:84%
It's really quite
good, and if you

00:39:26.866 --> 00:39:29.020 align:middle line:84%
get a thistle when
it's very young,

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.860 align:middle line:84%
the flower hasn't opened
yet, you could cut this open,

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and you'd have a tiny, tiny
little artichoke heart.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you want to pull it up,
but you might as well eat it.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.540 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
Lewis and Clark often

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:84%
survived off of when they
were traveling to the Pacific

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Northwest.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:84%
People often walk
by crab apples,

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.834 align:middle line:84%
thinking they're insignificant
because they're small,

00:39:51.834 --> 00:39:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll go
to the grocery store

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and buy commercial
apples imported

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:59.037 align:middle line:84%
from some other continent
for a high price

00:39:59.037 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:84%
when they might have
something even more delicious

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:90%
in their yard.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:10%
Apples are members
of the rose family,

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:10%
so they're a relative of
cherries, peaches, apricots.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So eating apples cleans your
teeth, freshens your breath.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.250 align:middle line:84%
They also can be a folk
remedy for stopping diarrhea.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So before you disdain those
crab apples, take a bite.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Give it a try.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.450 align:middle line:90%
You might have a winner.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, certainly not
all plants are edible.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:10%
There are some that
are very poisonous,

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.620 align:middle line:10%
and this plant looks like some
poisonous plants, including

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:10%
poison hemlock
and water hemlock,

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.200 align:middle line:10%
but the good news is
this is an edible plant.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It's wild carrot, also
known as Queen Anne's lace.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's a legend about a
queen that lived, I believe,

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:84%
in the 1700s, and
she was making lace,

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and she pricked her
finger, and a drop of blood

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:52.900 align:middle line:90%
fell upon her lace.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So do you see one little tiny
either pink, purple, or red

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:90%
flower at the center?

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.350 align:middle line:10%
So this is actually the
ancestor of carrots.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle line:10%
So if you pull this plant
up out of the ground,

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.980 align:middle line:10%
you would have a little root.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
as big or as tender

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:84%
as carrots that you grow in
the garden or buy at the store,

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.810 align:middle line:84%
but it is edible
and can be cooked,

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and certainly the leaves
make a really nice feather

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.990 align:middle line:90%
to put in your cap.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
You can juice the leaves, make
them into a salad, as well.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.380 align:middle line:84%
One tree that's really
easy to recognize,

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:84%
because it keeps its leaves
all winter, are pine trees.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So we are not able to
digest pine needles.

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They're very sharp
and fibrous, but they

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.950 align:middle line:84%
could be made into a tea,
or in a survival situation,

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:90%
you could chew them up.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.360 align:middle line:84%
You would extract simple
sugars and vitamin C,

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.971 align:middle line:84%
and then you could
spit out the pulp.

00:41:47.971 --> 00:41:49.720 align:middle line:84%
That could save your
life if you were ever

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.580 align:middle line:90%
stranded in the wilderness.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.730 align:middle line:84%
We also know that you
could cut out a portion,

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and take that inner tender
bark, and boil it like noodles,

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and could be a super
delicious, nourishing treat.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.860 align:middle line:84%
This wild plant
is very important.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.670 align:middle line:90%
It's called lamb's quarter.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.080 align:middle line:10%
It's also known as wild spinach.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:10%
So lamb's quarter
is totally edible.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.330 align:middle line:10%
Anything you do with spinach
you can do with lamb's quarter,

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:20.680 align:middle line:10%
whether it be spanokopita or
soup, or salad, or lasagna.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Lamb's quarter lasagna, anybody?

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:84%
This is also a
relative of amaranth,

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and quinoa, and beets.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so in the autumn, you get
these tiny little black seeds.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
You could use
those as a porridge

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:84%
or add them to an
extender to your oatmeal.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:42.580 align:middle line:84%
They're very nutritious,
high in protein, lysine,

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.580 align:middle line:84%
which is rare in
vegetable based plants.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And you could also sprout them
as a micro green in the winter

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and have fresh greens
all year round.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Lamb's quarter-- high in
iron, high in beta carotene.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So good for you, tastes just
like spinach, and a lot easier

00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.260 align:middle line:90%
to grow.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.190 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there a
good rule of thumb

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.650 align:middle line:84%
as to what to tell if
there is a poisonous plant?

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell specifically
if there's something

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that you shouldn't go after,
or is there any way to tell?

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: I don't want to
suggest that people just tell.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's some
things like beware

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.565 align:middle line:84%
of plants with white sap, but
dandelion has a white sap,

00:43:25.565 --> 00:43:27.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's edible.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Leaves of three, let
it be, like poison ivy.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.525 align:middle line:84%
But then red clover
has three leaves,

00:43:32.525 --> 00:43:33.650 align:middle line:90%
and it's a wonderful plant.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's confusing.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: I think with mushrooms
they say there are old mushroom

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:84%
hunters, and there are
bold mushroom hunters,

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:84%
but there are no old
bold mushroom hunters.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's a whole other chapter.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mushrooms.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: I think that really
having some good guidebooks,

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and taking classes,
and don't expect

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:57.120 align:middle line:84%
to learn all the plants--
try to learn a few a year.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Go on a walk with an expert.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.110 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't formulate
this little phone

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:07.080 align:middle line:10%
app called iPlant, which
it's available for iPhone

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:07.930 align:middle line:10%
and Android.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And it's
pictures concerns,

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.740 align:middle line:84%
like don't use during
pregnancy, or don't

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:90%
use with high blood pressure.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But it has a botanical
description and usually

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:21.386 align:middle line:84%
three pictures for each
plant, and you can blow it up,

00:44:21.386 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and it'll tell
you, is it edible?

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it medicinal?

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.839 align:middle line:90%
What does the name mean?

00:44:26.839 --> 00:44:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you take a picture
of it and have it identify it?

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: It doesn't
do that, but there

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.794 align:middle line:84%
are some phone
apps that do that,

00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:34.100 align:middle line:90%
like Leafsnap and plant chat.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.350 align:middle line:90%
I think there's a couple apps.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:37.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you
can cross-reference.

00:44:37.058 --> 00:44:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: You can cross-reference,
but what a noble cause

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:84%
to learn the names of
the plants around you.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the statistic that
the average American recognizes

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.490 align:middle line:84%
over 1,000 logos and
the products they're

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.840 align:middle line:84%
associated with, and yet less
than five plants or five birds.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.270 align:middle line:90%
So we just need to change that.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.860 align:middle line:84%
You can see the logo
on the front of a car.

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.526 align:middle line:84%
They don't even have
the name of the car

00:45:00.526 --> 00:45:03.150 align:middle line:84%
any longer because you
identify it through the logo.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.140 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of ways-- subtle
ways that we are marketed to.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Mother nature
doesn't necessarily

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.770 align:middle line:90%
have a marketing department.

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And you
were saying earlier,

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.990 align:middle line:84%
what is this thing about the
lawns and the pesticides?

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a belief that
we need to dominate nature,

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that nature is wild,
and free, and feminine.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.030 align:middle line:84%
We need to control her, and
rein her in, and bridle her,

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.950 align:middle line:90%
or she'll just go wild.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, having
a patch of grass

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:34.770 align:middle line:84%
might be nice to play
Frisbee with your dog

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.510 align:middle line:90%
or have a picnic on.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I disdain
grass, but we've

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.200 align:middle line:84%
gotten so over dependent on it,
and a few years ago in Boulder

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.480 align:middle line:90%
we had a dandelion festival.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.450 align:middle line:10%
And we asked city
council, why did

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.000 align:middle line:10%
you think you needed to
spray the dandelions?

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was, well,
people might trip over them,

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.962 align:middle line:90%
and they might take over.

00:45:56.962 --> 00:45:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Take over what?

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Take over.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.822 align:middle line:84%
Take over, and proliferate, and
make free food for everybody.

00:46:01.822 --> 00:46:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Make more dandelions.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.904 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: There you go.

00:46:03.904 --> 00:46:05.491 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
they're such a threat.

00:46:05.491 --> 00:46:07.990 align:middle line:84%
What's wrong with-- they got
such a bad rap, the dandelions.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.406 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: And we all
know that, when

00:46:09.406 --> 00:46:12.360 align:middle line:84%
you spray herbicides in your
yard, it ends up in the water.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.890 align:middle line:90%
It ends up in the ground.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It goes down to the creek,
and it drifts into the air

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.690 align:middle line:90%
that we're all breathing.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So we know better
now, and it's not

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.630 align:middle line:84%
time to start
thinking about this.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.399 align:middle line:90%
It's time for action.

00:46:26.399 --> 00:46:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and which is
why I love what you do.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.655 align:middle line:84%
And you bring people on walks--
on wild walks, don't you?

00:46:32.655 --> 00:46:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Yes, wild weed
walks all the time.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um--

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Yes, I'm giving
one this weekend,

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and I love doing that
because you never

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.920 align:middle line:84%
look at the world
the same way again.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Emerson said a weed is
an herb whose virtue has not

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.260 align:middle line:90%
yet been recognized.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So if I can help people to
respect this plant-- like,

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.702 align:middle line:90%
wow, this could save your life.

00:46:54.702 --> 00:46:56.160 align:middle line:84%
What if you were
lost in the woods?

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
our planet right now,

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.450 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
earthly disasters,

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and volcanoes, and hurricanes,
and tornadoes, and flooding.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And people are
dependent on when's

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Red Cross going to get here?

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And we know that, when
there's a disaster,

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:15.120 align:middle line:84%
the grocery stores empty
out really quickly.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Food that needs
to be trucked in--

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.040 align:middle line:84%
if it can't get in, it
really makes a mess,

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and very often food
can't get delivered

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:23.590 align:middle line:90%
to the people that need it.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I really think we should
be more empowered,

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.346 align:middle line:84%
and when my kids were
little, I would say--

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.970 align:middle line:84%
they'd say, mom, can
I have some money?

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, we're
going to go for a walk.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a quarter for
every plant you can identify,

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.180 align:middle line:84%
$0.50 if you can tell
me the Latin name,

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and $1 if you can
tell me three uses.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness,
that's a great game.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:46.230 align:middle line:90%
That is a great game.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I do have a question
about wildfires.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that
wildfires are ways

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.850 align:middle line:84%
for the forest to clear
itself and to start room

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:55.650 align:middle line:90%
for new growth.

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
opinions on wildfires?

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Well, it is
really a terrible thing.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: And my heart goes out.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I certainly know people
that have lost their homes.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the animals.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.190 align:middle line:10%
>>MARS: Interestingly
enough, I just

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:10%
wrote an article on an
herb called fire weed,

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:middle line:10%
and fire weed is one
of the first herbs

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:10%
to come back after
there's been a fire.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:21.877 align:middle line:10%
And they used to
call it bomb weed

00:48:21.877 --> 00:48:23.460 align:middle line:10%
because it was one
of the first plants

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:27.570 align:middle line:10%
to grow in craters where there
had been bombing in England.

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:31.560 align:middle line:10%
And here you have an area that's
been devastated, and sadness,

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.200 align:middle line:10%
and tragedy, and
here comes a plant

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.580 align:middle line:10%
with beautiful pink colors
that is totally edible,

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.080 align:middle line:10%
and it's like a Phoenix rising.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's going to
be a lot of fire weed growing,

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and it is edible, and it's
also very anti-inflammatory.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:48.900 align:middle line:90%
It makes a wonderful tea--

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.160 align:middle line:90%
fire weed honey.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean that it's going

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to replace people's homes and
the habitat of all our animals,

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and it also just shows
us how precious water is,

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:06.870 align:middle line:90%
because we need to be prepared.

00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean for everybody.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a smoke alarm?

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a fire
extinguisher in your house?

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Do you know how to use it?

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I took a course.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.520 align:middle line:84%
You want to spray going
this way along the bottom.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.520 align:middle line:84%
People don't know, and
when we're in a crisis,

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.300 align:middle line:84%
we often can't think clearly
about the right thing to do.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Are we cutting the shrubbery
away from our houses?

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.126 align:middle line:10%
So being prepared-- I
just wrote this book

00:49:30.126 --> 00:49:31.250 align:middle line:10%
called "Natural First Aid."

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.910 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Great, great.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.326 align:middle line:10%
>>MARS: It has a
lot on what to do

00:49:33.326 --> 00:49:35.610 align:middle line:10%
in cases of fire, and
flooding, and tornado,

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:37.620 align:middle line:10%
and finding water when
there is no water,

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.680 align:middle line:10%
and a few plants that
grow prolifically

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:10%
around the continent to
identify to find food.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Food.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:46.860 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.193 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: We need to be survivors.

00:49:48.193 --> 00:49:49.820 align:middle line:84%
All the things that
we thought, well,

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.020 align:middle line:84%
that just happens
in other countries,

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.110 align:middle line:90%
or that just happens in--

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.360 align:middle line:84%
it happens here, and we
can see that it can happen

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.520 align:middle line:90%
in the city and the country.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And it can happen to million
dollar homes, as well as

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:06.270 align:middle line:84%
little cabins in
never-never land.

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.349 align:middle line:90%
None of us are immune to it.

00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's a
beautiful video that's

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:15.645 align:middle line:84%
talking about the barberry root
and the incredible properties.

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: This is the famous
barberry, mahonia, also known

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:25.170 align:middle line:84%
as Oregon grape, or
Rocky Mountain grape.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they call it
California grape right here.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:32.650 align:middle line:10%
So this is in the
berberidaceae family.

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And right now it has
little yellow flowers,

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and you can see it's got
sharp pointed leaves.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a great xeriscape plant.

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need a lot
of water, but it's

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.700 align:middle line:84%
the root of this
plant that is used

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.040 align:middle line:84%
for its anti-microbial
properties.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It could be used as a substitute
for golden seal, which

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.030 align:middle line:90%
is endangered in the wild.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So this plant contains
berberine and is anti-microbial,

00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:00.450 align:middle line:84%
meaning anti-fungal,
anti-viral, antibacterial.

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:04.350 align:middle line:10%
And the root-- it's a great
remedy internally for skin

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:06.750 align:middle line:10%
ailments, and then
topically it would

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:11.850 align:middle line:10%
be good for drying up things
like acne, and psoriasis,

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:12.880 align:middle line:10%
eczema.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.370 align:middle line:90%
So I love this plant.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:17.100 align:middle line:84%
In the fall, it'll get
blue berries usually,

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:20.010 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes red berries,
and they're very, very sour.

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.050 align:middle line:84%
When you taste the
sour flavor, it usually

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:24.310 align:middle line:84%
tells you it's
good for the liver.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can make a lemonade
or a smoothie with it.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:30.690 align:middle line:10%
And most Americans are
fixated on two flavors--

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:34.330 align:middle line:10%
sweet and salty, but
really for ultimate health,

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:35.790 align:middle line:10%
we want to eat all five flavors.

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:37.560 align:middle line:10%
So sour is one of them--

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.670 align:middle line:10%
good for the liver
and the gall bladder.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:45.376 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is amazing how much
you know about just walking

00:51:45.376 --> 00:51:46.500 align:middle line:90%
along the side of the road.

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:50.280 align:middle line:84%
You just rattled off about
15 things that barberry

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.170 align:middle line:90%
can do-- the famous barberry.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.140 align:middle line:84%
You absolutely have
beautiful skin,

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and for someone who
is outside so much--

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:90%
and you're just ageless.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.730 align:middle line:10%
Are there great plants
for beautiful skin?

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:03.550 align:middle line:90%
What are your tips?

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Thank you.

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, skin is
really a reflection

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:08.850 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on
inside our body,

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and so we always want to think
about the health of our lungs

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.380 align:middle line:90%
and large intestines.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
what you put on,

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:17.430 align:middle line:84%
but I will share a
little secret with you.

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:18.850 align:middle line:90%
I do fruit facials.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: In the morning,
I rinse my face,

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and then I apply some kind
of fruit that's in-season.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Today it was a mulberry.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I just smushed a mulberry
all over my face.

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Yesterday was a cherry.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:35.280 align:middle line:90%
The day before was a peach.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.960 align:middle line:84%
You never want to
use mangoes, though,

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.510 align:middle line:84%
because mangoes are in
the poison ivy family.

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: They are.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:43.560 align:middle line:90%
So are cashews.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.510 align:middle line:10%
You may have heard that alpha
hydroxy citric acid, which

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.430 align:middle line:10%
is one of the hot
ingredients in cosmetics,

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.872 align:middle line:10%
is great for our skin.

00:52:51.872 --> 00:52:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could buy
a bottle of something

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.010 align:middle line:84%
with alpha hydroxy
citric acid, but you

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:58.680 align:middle line:84%
might have a fresh peach
or a fresh cucumber

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.030 align:middle line:84%
there that you could
just put it on your skin.

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to give you
exfoliating properties

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to help digest the
dead layers of skin,

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.560 align:middle line:90%
and it's also nourishing.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I always hope that the UPS
man doesn't come to the door

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.306 align:middle line:84%
when I have pomegranates
on my face or something,

00:53:16.306 --> 00:53:17.930 align:middle line:84%
but I leave it on
for about 10 minutes,

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:19.016 align:middle line:90%
and then I rinse it off.

00:53:19.016 --> 00:53:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I think another
thing is standing

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:23.240 align:middle line:84%
on your head every day, because
when you stand on your head,

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.972 align:middle line:84%
you invert, and you get the
blood to go to your head.

00:53:25.972 --> 00:53:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you do that?

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARS: Yeah, I
did this morning.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:29.360 align:middle line:90%
I do almost every day.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.026 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Every day
standing on your head.

00:53:31.026 --> 00:53:32.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the best tip ever.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.120 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.411 align:middle line:90%
What about your beautiful hair?

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:35.937 align:middle line:84%
You have such shiny,
beautiful hair.

00:53:35.937 --> 00:53:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Thank you so much.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, according to the
principles of Asian medicine,

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:43.210 align:middle line:10%
our hair is nourished a lot
by the health of our kidneys.

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.470 align:middle line:10%
And so people who want
to have healthy hair

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:49.460 align:middle line:10%
might want to think about eating
more black colored foods, not

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.740 align:middle line:10%
things that are dyed
black, but things

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.020 align:middle line:10%
that are black because
they're so high in minerals.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:54:00.080 align:middle line:10%
So things like wild rice,
black quinoa, black chia seeds,

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.320 align:middle line:10%
black beans, black seaweed.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.915 align:middle line:84%
Also nettles is great for your
hair, but standing on your head

00:54:05.915 --> 00:54:07.040 align:middle line:90%
is good for your hair, too.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Pumpkin seeds and sunflower
seeds are good for your hair.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:13.850 align:middle line:10%
So our physical body is
really just a manifestation

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:17.850 align:middle line:10%
of our inner health, and
sometimes people think,

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:21.110 align:middle line:10%
oh, we don't want to be
vain or put too much energy,

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:24.230 align:middle line:10%
but yet we love a beautiful
sunset or beautiful flowers.

00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So why not wear beautiful
colors, and eat beautiful food,

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and put our consciousness
in places of beauty?

00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I can see that.

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It really works for
you, but you live

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:39.770 align:middle line:84%
in such harmony with the land
that that makes so much sense

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.140 align:middle line:90%
that it's an extension of you.

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Thank you.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's wonderful.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I always ask my guests,
what is your biggest

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.890 align:middle line:90%
why for doing what you do?

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:50.780 align:middle line:84%
What motivates you to do
all of this incredible work

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.580 align:middle line:90%
in the world?

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: I feel so blessed.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:59.820 align:middle line:84%
If I get to help the
planet and people,

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm doing what
I was called here to do,

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and every day my
prayer is help me

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:12.910 align:middle line:84%
to help make a positive
difference in the world.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And if I can show people that
they can have better health

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time be
better stewards of the Earth,

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.760 align:middle line:90%
that does it for me.

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Then you're fulfilled.

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:24.196 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:27.760 align:middle line:84%
how to live so
close to the earth

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and to heal from everything,
all of our resources

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:31.900 align:middle line:90%
right around us.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I thank you so much for your
deep and vast knowledge.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:35.622 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:35.622 --> 00:55:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MARS: Many blessings.
