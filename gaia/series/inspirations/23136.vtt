00:00:13.887 --> 00:00:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello, and welcome.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.435 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had those
mystical coincidences

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.960 align:middle line:90%
that happen to you?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, you just
missed an accident,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:84%
or you were thinking of
somebody and they called,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you've had a
spontaneous healing experience.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Call them weird, call
them unexplainable.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Are they really
coincidences though?

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we are
it-- that human beings are

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:90%
the only force on this planet?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to explore
this subject of guides

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and guardian angels,
and we're going

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to do with one of the
foremost authorities

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:90%
on the subject, Doreen Virtue.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:10%
She not only has a
PhD in psychology,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:10%
she's also a
lifelong clairvoyant

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:10%
who works with
the angelic realm.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:10%
Doreen's appeared on Oprah.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:10%
She's appeared on
CNN and The View,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:10%
and many other programs
talking about connecting

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.055 align:middle line:10%
with our angels.

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
going to learn today.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Doreen.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOREEN VIRTUE:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be with you.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.856 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Great to
have you with me.

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Is Virtue your
original last name?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's my married
name, but it is my real name.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Many people think I made
it up, but I would not

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:84%
have the courage to make
up a name like that,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.245 align:middle line:84%
since there is a realm of
angels called the virtues.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, there is.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.745 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So explain
your childhood.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Did you grow up as a--
in a supportive family

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.519 align:middle line:84%
that knew a lot
about metaphysics?

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:10%
>>VIRTUE: My family-- both
my parents are still living,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:10%
thank goodness, and
they are extremely

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:10%
spiritual and metaphysical.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:10%
They're type of
spirituality is more along

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:10%
the lines of physical
healing and manifestation.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:10%
Angels and clairvoyance
really wasn't

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.715 align:middle line:10%
a part of their belief system.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:10%
It is now.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Do you have other
brothers and sisters?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.345 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I do.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I've got a brother
who's extremely psychic.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
He's more in the
mainstream world,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
but he foresaw things like
the Challenger explosion.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:90%
He sees world events happening.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
My mother's extremely
psychic and she's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual healer--
her mother as well.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So it is something
that's generational.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I do believe every one of us has
spiritual gifts and is psychic.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
some families make

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:84%
it a little easier
to retain them.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.945 align:middle line:84%
My family was very supportive
as we worked through this.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
The main thing that
I didn't understand

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't understand
was my visions of people.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And I now know I
was born a medium

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and I still am able to
connect with deceased people,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and I saw angels very
different than I do now.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.885 align:middle line:84%
But as a child I saw people
as clearly as I see you now.

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.135 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:02:40.135 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In this form.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.989 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: 3-D,
color, everything.

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'd see them staring at
me, and they wouldn't talk,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:90%
they weren't relatives I knew.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:90%
They were just random people.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I saw them everywhere.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.502 align:middle line:84%
And I learned very quickly that
other people didn't see them,

00:02:53.502 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
because I would say look
at this man over here.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.007 align:middle line:84%
I'd tell my mom there's
people in my bedroom.

00:02:58.007 --> 00:02:59.215 align:middle line:90%
No one could see them but me.

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:90%
So it was very frightening.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.584 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did she support you or?

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: They were
supportive, but they

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
didn't understand
what was going on.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
There was no movie The
Sixth Sense back then,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:90%
to make a cultural reference.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So my mom and dad thought
that I was seeing reflections

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
from the TV set on my bedroom
window, which didn't make sense

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
because the TV set
was way down the hall.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: But there
was just no way

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that I
have second sight.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you were
to tell a parent how

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
to parent a child right now
who's saying those things,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell the parent?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, and
fortunately I do this now

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
with parents who
come to my workshops.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:90%
There's two things.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:84%
One is to manage
energies that we

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
might call lower energies
or fear-based energies that

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
are attracted to children
who are clairvoyant.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the other is the angels
and loving deceased loved ones

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:90%
that come.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So you want to
empower your child

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.380 align:middle line:84%
by teaching them to call
on Archangel Michael who's

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:84%
available to everyone
who asks for him.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've taught
children to do things

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
like have a little
bell that the child can

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:90%
ring that can clear the energy.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Or to have the child
say loving words

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.692 align:middle line:84%
that can lift the
energy as well.

00:04:09.692 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you, when you were
young and experiencing these

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.367 align:middle line:84%
various energies, were you
frightened because some

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:14.522 align:middle line:90%
of them--

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --were dark?

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.965 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:90%
I was very frightened.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
I mean I had the
craziest childhood.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
I felt very lonely.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And people would
whisper things about me

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up in this family
that manifested our needs.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
When our family car
broke down, my dad

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
got a model car of what
he wanted us to manifest,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
put it on the television set,
and had my brother and myself

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and my mom and him every
day visualize and affirm

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:84%
that this car was paid in
full and in our driveway.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:90%
And it came true.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Within about three
months we had that car.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And we would use prayer and
affirmations instead of doctors

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:90%
if we were sick.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And if our washing machine
or our car broke down

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:90%
we would use these same tools.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go to school very
naive and talk about this,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and the kids treated me
like I was just insane.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So I, for a long time, did
not feel like I fit in.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.865 align:middle line:84%
It's a miracle now that I
can talk about this publicly.

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I know for a long
time you just completely

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:90%
cut it off--

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, I tried to.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and shut it out.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I wanted to fit in.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:90%
I was very sensitive.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be liked.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.425 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I wanted friends.

00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
So I tried to be a normal human.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.204 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work real well.

00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You tried, but then
you went into psychology

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.661 align:middle line:90%
and you went to medical school.

00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I did.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was told to go to
college, and when I was there

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:90%
I studied psychology.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I think I was trying to
figure myself out, honestly,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and just kept going.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.185 align:middle line:84%
And got my BA, and my Masters,
and my PhD in psychology.

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
interested in-- I still

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
am-- in eating disorders
and women's studies.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So I became an eating
disorder specialist,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and my first books
were on these topics.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still very
much interested

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
in how food affects, now the
aura, and the energy level,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and the body, and the
health, and strength.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I know for a
fact that you're a vegan--

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Gluten-free,
organic vegan, yeah.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's my own way
to deal with my body.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.204 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's
metabolism's different.

00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
What I tell everyone
is you've got

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to listen to your own
guidance and follow it,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
because your angels will
tell you what to eat

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and what not to eat.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it works
for you because you're

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.967 align:middle line:90%
timeless and ageless.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.822 align:middle line:90%
I feel fantastic.

00:06:25.822 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, you've
helped a lot of women.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've
opened women's centers.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And with your
background in psychology,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
you've been able to help
entire women from abuse

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.634 align:middle line:90%
to eating disorders.

00:06:38.634 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And you still have some of
those centers, don't you?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.462 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:06:41.462 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, my doctoral
dissertation was

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
about the link between
childhood abuse

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and the development of
an eating disorder, which

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.100 align:middle line:84%
was what my clinical
specialty had been

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
is to help women who'd
been sexually abused

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
or had had any kind of emotional
or psychological abuse.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
They often use food and weight
to deal with their issues.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So my first Hay House book was
actually "Losing Your Pounds

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
of Pain," which was my
doctoral dissertation made

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.667 align:middle line:84%
a little more easy to read
with a lot of case studies.

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you
should bring that back

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.827 align:middle line:84%
because that's very
pertinent today.

00:07:17.827 --> 00:07:18.365 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's still in print.

00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's still in print.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But especially
with youth today.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that more and more
children, and even teenagers,

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
are coming in with
these sensitivities that

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:90%
are wide open?

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think now?

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I think that children
have always been born psychic.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
The difference is
parents, not children.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Parents now are more apt
to come to me and brag,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:90%
oh, my child's psychic.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's practically
to the point

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.736 align:middle line:84%
where we have bumper stickers
instead of "honor roll

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
students" that "my
child sees angels."

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It used to be, even
20, 30 years ago where

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.366 align:middle line:84%
parents would become so alarmed
at the invisible friends

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
that their kids
would talk about.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I have met adults
who told me they

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:84%
were put into psychiatric
institutions-- locked up--

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.265 align:middle line:84%
because they said they
heard angels or saw things.

00:08:06.265 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: On the
way here there was

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
a man in the airport who was
surrounded by two guards,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:90%
and he said, "I see beings.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:90%
I see beings."

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:90%
And he was being retained.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Wow.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Just on the way here.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So explain what
people can do when

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:84%
they start to see
those types of-- what

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:90%
do you physically see?

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.976 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
as a child, when I

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
saw-- I saw deceased people
3D, completely dimensional.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.434 align:middle line:84%
And angels to me looked like
dancing Christmas lights.

00:08:36.434 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way I could
have described them.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Just different colors
just dancing around.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I could hear this
wo-wo-wo, interdimensional

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.070 align:middle line:90%
music with it.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I could feel like I was
going through almost like one

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:84%
of those worms that you
have in outer space.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wormholes?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.323 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Wormholes, yeah.

00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I could feel myself in
a different dimension

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:90%
when they'd show up.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was wild, so it was
like living in two worlds.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time almost
every night, this old man

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.825 align:middle line:84%
would come to me and
he's one of my guides,

00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and he would take me to
places, like other planets.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:90%
He took me to see the future.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:84%
He showed me what Earth would
look like, what would happen.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:84%
He showed me what my
life purpose was to be.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.233 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:09:19.233 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What--

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --it was frightening
because when I would be awake

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.210 align:middle line:84%
during the day, other
people weren't so happy

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.997 align:middle line:90%
that I was doing these things.

00:09:29.997 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What would you see,
if you don't mind my asking,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:90%
into the future?

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, they
showed me global warming,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and this was back in the
'60s I was getting all this.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me that
the world would become

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
very topical, and
that the polar ice

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
caps would melt to create
new fresh water at a time

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:84%
when the water would
be polluted here.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And they showed me
that we would be

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:84%
all eating fresh organic
produce from tropical trees.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And that it was actually going
to be a blessing that we would

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.962 align:middle line:84%
warm up in the whole world,
and not to be afraid of it.

00:10:01.962 --> 00:10:03.253 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not to be afraid of it.

00:10:03.253 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And have you seen the visions
that you saw back then manifest

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.223 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh yeah.

00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:07.723 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:10:07.723 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And even today I'm
seeing them, yeah.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And into
our future now, what

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:90%
do we have to look forward to?

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
assuming that each of us

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
takes our personal
responsibility seriously,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
which is to be at
peace and to be happy.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:84%
That really is our
own little corners,

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:84%
like we're all waiters and
waitresses in a restaurant.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
The table you take
care of is yourself.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
You can't control another
person being happy.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you take steps to
take care of your body,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever you need to
do to be truly happy-- not

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
artificially happy like having
a lot of alcohol or something.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Real happiness that
comes from being grateful

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:90%
for what you've got now.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And taking care of
your body, and taking

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:90%
care of your relationships.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:90%
All those things.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're happy, this future
of this world is beautiful.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that's
what it takes or does

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
it take motivating the masses,
communicating with the masses?

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I always hear
different approaches

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
with how we really could
have a sustainable planet.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, I
don't know about you,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:84%
but I don't like to be
told what to do, do you?

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.175 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's each of us
taking care of ourselves.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So I hope I can inspire someone
who says wow, she looks happy.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.275 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll try what she's doing.

00:11:20.275 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going
to tell someone

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:90%
do this, do that, do that.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.974 align:middle line:84%
Because all of us
have this inner rebel.

00:11:25.974 --> 00:11:28.265 align:middle line:84%
We don't even want God telling
us what to do, let alone

00:11:28.265 --> 00:11:30.899 align:middle line:90%
some person.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
mean that's my purpose?

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.257 align:middle line:90%
Yeah,yeah.

00:11:33.257 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: We have to think
about it for ourselves.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is
kind of what you did.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
You decided this-- what do
you want to be your path,

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:84%
and you went on to go to
school and to get your Ph.D.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.709 align:middle line:84%
What woke you back
up into that place?

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I literally had to
have a gun stuck to my head.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.919 align:middle line:84%
I mean what happened was
I kept getting messages,

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:84%
being a psychologist is
close, but that's not it.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was helping people,
but bottom line I wasn't happy.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I had bestselling
books out there.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd have my name all over
magazines, on the newsprint.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
I was on TV, major TV shows,
practically every week.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't happy.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So something was
wrong, and I didn't

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
want to believe the
guidance I was getting

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
to teach about spiritual
healing and angels,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
because all I could remember
was being teased as a child

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:90%
for being weird.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I don't
want to do that.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So the last time that I fought
all of this was July 15, 1995.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was going
to an appointment

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:90%
in Anaheim, California.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:84%
At the time I lived
in Newport Beach.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And my guides were screaming
at me to put the top up

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
on my convertible car
or it would be stolen.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But the motor was broken
on this BMW I had.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:90%
So it was stuck down.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:90%
It was summer.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And so I prayed for protection.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
location I was going to,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:84%
the top being down apparently
had attracted the attention

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:84%
of these two men
that were going down

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln Boulevard
and hijacking cars.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
got out of my car,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.630 align:middle line:84%
this angry-looking little
man with a gun, and then

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:84%
he had an accomplice
back here with a knife

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and a running getaway
car, just with cuss words,

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not used because I'm
a very gentle person, starting

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.484 align:middle line:84%
cussing at me and demanding
my car keys and my purse.

00:13:16.484 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
oh, this is what

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:90%
the guides were talking about.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So I
heard this voice say

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.190 align:middle line:84%
to me scream with
all your might.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a scream from fear,
it was a scream from power.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, from the gut, I
screamed like a cave woman,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
just this primal
sound came out of me.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And the little man in front
of me, his eyes got this big,

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that was my in--
that he was suddenly afraid,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:90%
even though he had the weapon.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:90%
It was like David and Goliath.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:45.309 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:46.536 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Seriously.

00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
The screams attracted
the attention

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of a woman who was sitting in
her car in the parking lot.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
She saw what was happening,
leaned on her car horn,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and everyone at this church
where I had this appointment

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
came out, and then
those two men ran away.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I'm sitting
there going what just happened?

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.804 align:middle line:90%
A voice that sounded--

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Clearly.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.485 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --like your
voice outside my head

00:14:09.485 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:90%
had warned me about this.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.307 align:middle line:84%
The other voice had told me
scream with all your might.

00:14:13.307 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And they knew what
was going to happen

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:90%
an hour before it happened.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.936 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many times
does that happen to us,

00:14:17.936 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
when we're not listening to
the guidance, when we hear--

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:84%
so many times after someone has
been through either an accident

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
or an attack of similar
nature, they say I knew.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:90%
I had an intuition.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:90%
I had an instinct.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the
biggest things.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
My husband teaches
martial arts, and that's

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.864 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest
things that he

00:14:35.864 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
hears from people
who are victims

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:84%
is that they had an
instinct they didn't follow.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's very true.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:84%
That guidance comes in,
and how much do we deny it.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Exactly.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
we don't trust it.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.251 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: No.

00:14:46.251 --> 00:14:48.275 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
it's not from here.

00:14:48.275 --> 00:14:50.439 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: We do what I
call logically override it.

00:14:50.439 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
when you're being

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
told to take an umbrella in the
morning and you look outside

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
clouds in the sky,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.227 align:middle line:84%
and two hours
later it's pouring.

00:14:58.227 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.351 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's
exactly the same thing

00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a danger
thing or a comfort thing.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So where do
those voices come from?

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Where do these angels come from?

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, in the ultimate
spiritual truth we're one.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
spirit, one love.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:84%
We're one with the creator,
we're one with angels.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But in this world of separation
and illusion that we're in,

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.290 align:middle line:84%
these guides come
in as connectors,

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
as messengers-- that's
what angels mean after all.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they help us to bridge
the world of 100% love, which

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
is where we're really from, and
that's what I define God as.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And then our world that has
a duality of fear and love,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.161 align:middle line:84%
the angels are the
bridge between the two.

00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because we live
in a physical dimension.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
What about this physical
dimension that we're in

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:84%
has that polarity
of fear and love.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's the
density, and it's

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:84%
the original ego that
said wouldn't it be cool

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:84%
if I could be God and
I could be in charge.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like a teenage kid
who runs away from home

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and gets their own
apartment, but wants

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:90%
parents to still pay for it.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what the ego is.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's
revelling with ourselves.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.444 align:middle line:84%
It's being a rebellion
against ourselves.

00:16:06.444 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: The ego
wants to be God.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the ego wants
us to worship fear

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and gives us all
sorts of scenarios,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.855 align:middle line:84%
including thinking
that other people are

00:16:14.855 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:84%
worse than you or other
people are better than you.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.216 align:middle line:84%
That's the main thing it
does with level confusion.

00:16:20.216 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love how you bring in
the psychology with what you're

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
talking about with
the angelic realm

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.910 align:middle line:84%
because it makes it so
practical for some reason.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:84%
It brings it to a
grounded reality.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: At the same time, I
have had wonderful conversations

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.067 align:middle line:84%
with you, and I fall off
of the path all the time--

00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: We all do.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.983 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --of communicating
with my-- all the time.

00:16:39.983 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
see you, I go why--

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:90%
it's so easy to ask for help.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.766 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's not whether
we fall off the path

00:16:47.766 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:90%
or have an ego.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's what we do with it.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And if we can learn
from it or teach others,

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:90%
then that's the whole point.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you
ask for guidance, and how

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.861 align:middle line:84%
do you really know
they're there?

00:16:56.861 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Well, let's talk up.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.236 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about free will.

00:16:59.236 --> 00:16:59.735 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:16:59.735 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So in this world,
we have complete free will,

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and not even the
creator can intervene

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:90%
without our permission.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So we have to ask for help with
everything, with everything.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the part that puts
a lot of responsibility on us.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And then religion
sometimes taints this

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
by saying to people, well, you
should only ask for big things,

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
or don't bother God and the
angels with little things.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's the projection
of the human ego on God

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:90%
that's incorrect, spiritually.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:84%
What's correct is that
there's an unlimited universe

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that God is omnipresent, that
these beings we call angels,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
which are light and love and
intelligence, are unlimited.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:90%
They're holographic.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:84%
They can be with everyone
helping with-- anything

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.299 align:middle line:84%
that brings you peace
they're happy to do.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know what
would bring you peace,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.145 align:middle line:84%
you can just say this
or something better.

00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I love that prayer.

00:17:54.895 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just turn into
a positive experience?

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, well
this is the whole point

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:90%
is our purpose is to be happy.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is holy.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a very high vibration.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when we go into the
ego, which includes fear,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.379 align:middle line:90%
guilt-- big one-- anxiety--

00:18:16.379 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --depression, anger.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.870 align:middle line:90%
It's either love or fear.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It's very black and white.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's many, many
different shades of fear.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And the ego's always looking
for our Achilles heel.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
What can I get them with
to worship fear again?

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.932 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:18:30.932 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try
and make them feel

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
unsafe about the world,
about the future.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.798 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try
and make them feel

00:18:35.798 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:84%
like they're not good
enough or that they're

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:90%
better than others.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Ego's always looking for that.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you recognize the
ego, then it's just this little

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
buzzing fly you don't
pay attention to.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
have put together,

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.376 align:middle line:84%
which I think is so great,
between you and your son,

00:18:49.376 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:84%
you've put together
these slides that

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:84%
show us the frequency
of our languaging.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.815 align:middle line:84%
How does this
relate to what we're

00:18:57.815 --> 00:18:59.565 align:middle line:84%
talking about here
with the angelic realm?

00:18:59.565 --> 00:19:01.148 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It does
very much so, and it

00:19:01.148 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:84%
reminds me of my good friend
Masaru Emoto's work with water.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: The physical
world, as we all know,

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:90%
is composed of energy.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And now with, of course,
electronic microscopes,

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.945 align:middle line:84%
we can see that everything's
moving all the time.

00:19:15.945 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And we all know
that the words we speak

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:90%
create and attract.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is
metaphysics 101 and it

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:84%
was taught by
Socrates and Jesus.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
What is new is that my son,
who's a computer genius, when

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I was recording a podcast one
day and I said the word angel,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
he was watching on
the oscilloscope

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
on the computer what
that word looked like.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said, mom, it looks
like an angel in flight.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
We actually have
a slide of this.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:84%
It looks like an
angel in flight.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:90%
How does that--

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It looks like wings.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, I see.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.433 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: See how
the wings are there?

00:19:52.433 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And I love to
find patterns in things.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So when this graph
on the computer

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:84%
showed that when I
said the word angel

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:84%
this is what it looked
like, I thought,

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.837 align:middle line:84%
and I said to my son, Grant,
let's look at other words

00:20:08.837 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and see if we can find
any kind of patterns.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea what
we would look for,

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:90%
how it would turn about.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But it set my son,
Grant Virtue and myself,

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
off on about a year
and a half, maybe

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:84%
two years of recording
different words and phrases

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:84%
into the computer program
and then looking at it.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:90%
We found this clear pattern.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You say that we all know
about the frequency of words.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we don't.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we don't know about
the frequency of words.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I knew
it intellectually.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.942 align:middle line:84%
I mean everyone knows if
you say something positive,

00:20:38.942 --> 00:20:41.025 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create
something positive in life.

00:20:41.025 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's
take a look at that

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
a negative-- there

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:90%
is no customers in the area.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.131 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: This is
really interesting.

00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
All this is from our
book Angel Words.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.420 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed people who
had changed their life

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
by changing the
words that they said.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And this story comes from a
waitress who lives on tips.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And so she was
working in a restaurant

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and she was complaining to
the other waitresses every day

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that there was no customers
in her area of tables,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.690 align:middle line:84%
and so she wasn't
making many tips.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, what Grant
and I found-- you

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.350 align:middle line:84%
can see that there's a
middle line on these words.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And that the negative phrases
and words were very tightly

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:90%
surrounding these lines.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And this waitress, whose
story is in Angel Words,

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
was manifesting or having
a self-fulfilling prophecy

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:84%
of having no customers,
and therefore, she

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:90%
was getting no tips.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:84%
She realized this, and
she changed her words

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.991 align:middle line:90%
to a more positive phrase.

00:21:39.991 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
what it looks like when

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:84%
"there is a flow of
abundance," and that's

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.395 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic frequency
of the words.

00:21:46.395 --> 00:21:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that what that is?

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
You can see that the
peaks of the words

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
in her phrase "there's
a flow of abundance"

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
were higher and lower
surrounding the middle line.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
they're bigger.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:84%
This really shows high frequency
and low frequency words

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and phrases.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.533 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as she
started doing this,

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
she started getting more
customers in her area.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not magic or
woo-woo hocus-pocus.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that it made her a
happier person and more people

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
wanted to come to
the restaurant.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:15.741 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So she did.

00:22:15.741 --> 00:22:17.294 align:middle line:84%
She started changing
her languaging--

00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and it
changed her outcome.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Exactly.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And, of course, she
had to have her belief system

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:90%
matching the languaging--

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --because you
can't just say the words.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
actually, we experimented

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.410 align:middle line:90%
with that very thing.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.035 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: We said
positive words when

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:84%
using the energy of anger
and sadness and anxiety.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.724 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't matter.

00:22:35.724 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a
little bit of a change,

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:90%
but it was the words themselves.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.402 align:middle line:84%
And we tried
different languages.

00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is--

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: They had--

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --so interesting.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --an
embedded energy field.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is
really interesting.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you what it looks
like when you say something

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.962 align:middle line:84%
negative about
yourself, as opposed

00:22:49.962 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
to when you say
something positive.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.961 align:middle line:84%
So here's the slide
with that sample.

00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So this
is from a singer

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in the UK named Anna Taylor
who had a lifelong dream

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to become a very famous
singer and have a CD out.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And she used to go around saying
I'm not a very good singer.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And when she changed it and she
caught that-- a lot of times

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.079 align:middle line:90%
we do this unconsciously.

00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And she was lucky enough
to have good friends who

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.570 align:middle line:90%
pointed that out to her.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And so she said, oh,
now that I know it,

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go around
saying I'm a talented singer.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:84%
She started saying that before
she believed it to be true.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
But we noticed, because I've
known Anna for maybe 15 years,

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that her voice changed and
improved just by saying I'm a--

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:27.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah. --a
talented singer.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:84%
She started to get jobs, and
now she's on her second CD.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Psychologically, do
you match up with the things

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about?

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.425 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Eventually.

00:23:37.425 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:84%
It can take up to a month
of saying them steadily.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.045 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you recommend
doing affirmations?

00:23:43.045 --> 00:23:43.916 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Big time.

00:23:43.916 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I changed my
life with them, yeah.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I had very low confidence
from being teased so much

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
as a child, and having
some kind of emotionally

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
abusive relationships
along the way.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And from being such an
open clear channel, I'm sure.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.659 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:59.659 --> 00:24:04.569 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually knew that
affirmations, you know,

00:24:04.569 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
because I was raised
with them, would

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:84%
be the best way to
raise my confidence.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I created my own-- at
that time they were cassette

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.359 align:middle line:90%
tapes--

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --and I created
my own affirmation tape

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
with positive words and phrases,
like I have wonderful friends,

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I have a fit, healthy body,
I'm a best-selling author.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:84%
These were not true
at the time at all.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
It made me cringe to hear my
own voice and hear these words,

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.150 align:middle line:84%
but I listened to them every
day, two or three times a day.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And within about
three weeks, I started

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to see that I was getting
more assertive with people.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I had more clear boundaries.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:90%
I felt good about myself.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I started to drop weight.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.717 align:middle line:90%
And they all came true.

00:24:43.717 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is an
amazingly practical tool.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.472 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I wish I
still had the CD.

00:24:47.472 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But people
could do this though--

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, they can.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --easily, especially
with smartphones now.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.764 align:middle line:84%
Well, your own voice is
what your unconscious

00:24:53.764 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:90%
responds to the best.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah-ha.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.731 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:24:56.731 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's more than
the written where

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:90%
you put post-its everywhere.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.930 align:middle line:84%
If you actually record this
into your phone and you

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.044 align:middle line:84%
can play it back to yourself
through your headset.

00:25:05.044 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.793 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like the
sound of your own voice,

00:25:07.793 --> 00:25:09.492 align:middle line:90%
you need it more than ever.

00:25:09.492 --> 00:25:10.325 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:25:10.325 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It means that
you need to love your voice

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.749 align:middle line:90%
and love yourself.

00:25:13.749 --> 00:25:14.915 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even more than ever.

00:25:14.915 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Um-hmm.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this next slide is
an example of what it looks like

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:90%
when you--

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, I love this story.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:90%
This from our book Angel Words.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a story from a woman who
owns a metaphysical bookstore,

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:84%
who she says I should
have known better.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
When people would come into
the store and how's business,

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:84%
she would go around saying
that she would never be rich.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.334 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
kind of something

00:25:37.334 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:90%
that she kind of grew up saying.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was because she
thought it would be bragging.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:84%
She was trying to
be humble with it.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Exactly.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.580 align:middle line:90%
But her store was suffering.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And so someone pointed
out to her, she caught it,

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and so she started to say
this place is a gold mine.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said it was instant that
customers started to come in

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:90%
and buying her products.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that no
matter what kind of business

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
you're in, you can apply
immediately and have very, very

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:90%
visible and tangible results.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.579 align:middle line:84%
Look at the difference in the
energy of those two phrases.

00:26:10.579 --> 00:26:11.995 align:middle line:84%
When you say "I'll
never be rich,"

00:26:11.995 --> 00:26:15.265 align:middle line:84%
it's very tight, and
tense, and stress involved.

00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:17.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you say "this
place is a gold mine,"

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
it's just a higher
vibration, you

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:84%
can feel it's a lot more
relaxed and it loosens you up.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you relax you
get more creative ideas.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:90%
You're a happier person.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:84%
People want to
hang out with you.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Your store's energy
feels better.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.100 align:middle line:90%
It attracts people.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was having
this conversation

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
with Tina, my producer, about
the idea that whenever anyone

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.940 align:middle line:84%
says how are you, we always
say we're really super busy.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.565 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And right.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And we made an agreement
together on the phone

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.704 align:middle line:84%
the other day to
change that story--

00:26:46.704 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Great.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and to open
up with we're fabulous.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.032 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:26:51.032 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just to
say we're fabulous.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.431 align:middle line:84%
And it's a gift you give to the
person who hears that phrase.

00:26:55.431 --> 00:26:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.661 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not-- so I
invite the people watching.

00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:02.160 align:middle line:84%
If you ever have that story
when someone says "how are you,"

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:90%
what's the first thing you say?

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.401 align:middle line:84%
What is the first thing
say you after that?

00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm busy.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.964 align:middle line:90%
I'm crazy.

00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:10.505 align:middle line:84%
I mean what things
are you affirming?

00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And then it comes true.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.797 align:middle line:84%
If you say you don't have
enough time, that's the truth.

00:27:14.797 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.045 align:middle line:84%
That is what we're
validating, and continuing

00:27:18.045 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:84%
to create scarcity and
not time and stuff.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a friend of
mine that I always

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:84%
watch one of the kids in
the family's always sick.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And I look at her languaging,
and she said, "oh,

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:90%
so-and-so's sick again."

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost an expectation
of a child being sick,

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:84%
which is almost a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.855 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's her story.

00:27:37.855 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, so let's take
a look at what this is.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:84%
What sick versus
healthy looks like.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.903 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So look at the
difference there in the energy.

00:27:43.903 --> 00:27:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're literally looking
at high vibrational words

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:90%
when you say healthy.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:90%
That's almost off the charts.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is interesting.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.885 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:27:50.885 --> 00:27:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've
learned as a writer

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:84%
is that there's always a
positive way to say everything.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask
the angels to help

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.600 align:middle line:84%
you to rewrite the words if
you find that maybe that's not

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:90%
your best talent.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So even if you change
the frequency that you say it

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.634 align:middle line:84%
in, if you say "I'm healthy"
and you change the tonality--

00:28:09.634 --> 00:28:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It doesn't matter.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It doesn't matter.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:84%
You've tried using all
of these different forms?

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.705 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:28:13.705 --> 00:28:14.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the word itself.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
That because so many
people have imbued

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:22.296 align:middle line:84%
meaning into these
words, that they are big.

00:28:22.296 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of the words
that we thought

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
would be negative and kind
of tight, small, surprisingly

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:84%
were big, like the
word drugs we thought

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
would be very low
vibrating because it's

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:90%
associated with drug abuse.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.066 align:middle line:84%
But it's words that have--
and the word fat, too.

00:28:36.066 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:84%
We thought that would
be low vibrating.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's instances where
the word drugs is something

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that helps people and it
can be positive, and--

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --fat can be
like a fat raise you get

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:90%
or a big fat kiss.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So the words that
are universally

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
considered negative, we have
outlined in this book Angel

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Words.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, this
book changed my life.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.670 align:middle line:84%
After looking at
these pictures--

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This was interesting
because I earmarked

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.045 align:middle line:84%
one of these because the name
of the book is Angel Words,

00:29:04.045 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and it's a Hay House book.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I have-- really, the self
talk that we tell ourselves,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and I had earmarked
this a while ago.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.765 align:middle line:84%
Just these random phrases that
people say, "damned if you do,

00:29:15.765 --> 00:29:16.640 align:middle line:90%
damned if you don't."

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.955 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah, we have
the cliches and how those--

00:29:18.955 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cliches.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.754 align:middle line:84%
"I'm as serious as a heart
attack." very, very low vi--

00:29:24.754 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So you don't
want to say that.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't want to--

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.586 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: These
days, you manifest

00:29:28.586 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:90%
almost instantly what you say.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.740 align:middle line:90%
We've got to be very cautious.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's "No good
deed goes unpunished."

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.947 align:middle line:84%
Where these words tend
to be so-- "Break a leg."

00:29:40.947 --> 00:29:42.655 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And we show
the computer graphs

00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:44.940 align:middle line:90%
of these cliches.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.881 align:middle line:84%
And once you see that, then
you won't want to do them.

00:29:47.881 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, people tell me
they're buying this book

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to give to their relatives
who complain a lot

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:90%
and who are negative.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you have anything
to do with copywriting

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.339 align:middle line:84%
or if you're on
the internet a lot

00:29:57.339 --> 00:29:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
change the frequency,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.380 align:middle line:84%
because so much of
our communication

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:84%
happens through
email these days,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.424 align:middle line:90%
you can put words in there.

00:30:03.424 --> 00:30:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And the book gives
you, of course,

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.500 align:middle line:84%
the antidote for
all of the words.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.981 align:middle line:84%
So there's instead
of saying "break

00:30:07.981 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
a leg," you can say
"you can do it,"

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:84%
or "may the force be
with you," or "luxury

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.456 align:middle line:90%
is our soul mate lover."

00:30:16.456 --> 00:30:17.624 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:30:17.624 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there's a
lot of different ways

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:84%
that you can change the
tonality of an email

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:90%
by just using these--

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.211 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: You know, we
talked the ego, and the ego

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:84%
its whole basis is to delay
happiness for the future,

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:84%
because the ego knows
that if we're happy,

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:37.320 align:middle line:84%
we're high vibrational, that
it loses its whole life force.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like the wicked
witch in The Wizard of Oz.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.238 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You mean
it loses its goal?

00:30:41.238 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's gone.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.802 align:middle line:84%
Ego is fear and
that's all it is.

00:30:44.802 --> 00:30:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm lost.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Ego is
the belief that you

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:84%
are separated from God, which
is the most terrifying thought

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.810 align:middle line:90%
that could ever happen to us.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's impossible to
happen because the creator

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:90%
and the created are still one.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But the ego continuously tries
to tell us, you're on your own,

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.729 align:middle line:84%
there's a scarcity of
money, a scarcity of food.

00:31:01.729 --> 00:31:03.270 align:middle line:84%
You better get yours
before you get--

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:03.994 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Survival.

00:31:03.994 --> 00:31:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But the ego says that you
will be happy in the future

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.140 align:middle line:84%
if you create these conditions,
and it's fill in the blank

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.540 align:middle line:84%
that if all the wars are
done, if all the children,

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:90%
if the pollution's gone.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:84%
If you get married or divorced,
if you lose weight, if you

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%
pay off your bills.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Then the promise the
ego gives you is you'll

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.470 align:middle line:90%
be happy in the future.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.007 align:middle line:84%
The higher self knows
that God created you happy

00:31:27.007 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:84%
because you're in the image
and likeness of the creator,

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and the creator
is 100% happiness.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you would just
know that right now,

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.690 align:middle line:84%
you don't need
conditions to be happy.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:90%
You've already got it.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And so the book
Angel Words speaks

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:84%
to vibrating at that
level of happiness

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.630 align:middle line:90%
now, not in the future.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let me ask
you about that where there's

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy theories and a
lot of fear and domination

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.080 align:middle line:84%
that we're being suppressed
under in certain environments,

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.310 align:middle line:84%
in political and
economic environments.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So those energies
tend to be the heavier

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and more vague and
dark and survivalistic.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:05.135 align:middle line:90%
But they are very present.

00:32:05.135 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.551 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:32:06.551 --> 00:32:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a Pollyanna or
sugar-coating everything.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what's
going on in the world.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those conspiracy
theories are correct.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.230 align:middle line:90%
There are those things going on.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.646 align:middle line:84%
But there's two
ways to handle it.

00:32:16.646 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Fear or love, fear or love.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:84%
If you handle it
from the ego, it

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.580 align:middle line:84%
just puts gasoline on the
fire and makes it worse.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:84%
You are giving more power
to the fear-based ego

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:90%
and to all of that dark energy.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But the solution
is for all of us

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:84%
to be happy, speak
up when you need to.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm very
politically active.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.127 align:middle line:84%
I think we all should
be voting and be

00:32:38.127 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
aware of what's going
on in the world.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:middle line:84%
But from a place
of prayer and love.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.804 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it go into fear.

00:32:42.804 --> 00:32:44.511 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have to ask
you, because you're

00:32:44.511 --> 00:32:47.360 align:middle line:84%
the perfect person, I think, to
ask about something like this.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.350 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
chemtrails, which

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:84%
we see evidence of in
the skies and so forth,

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and the chemical dumping that's
happening in our environment.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:84%
How do you change
that into something

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that you can use
as a good force?

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, the people
who are perpetuating things

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that we find evil or
obnoxious, they will respond

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:84%
to all of us lifting the
collective energy of the world.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.605 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much an ocean activist,
and I'm very, very involved

00:33:17.605 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:84%
in protecting the cetaceans,
the dolphins and the whales.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And when things
happen to them where

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:84%
they wash up dead
on the beach, I

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
have to really watch my thoughts
because that's my Achilles heel

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and the ego knows it, where
I could get very, very upset

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:90%
and lose sleep.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:84%
That's not going
to help anything.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.784 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To say it's them--

00:33:33.784 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: That doesn't help.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:38.260 align:middle line:84%
That's an ego device to blame
others and to think, well,

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I could be happy if they would
take care of dolphins and such.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do instead
is to raise the vibrations

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:84%
to the point where people
would never even consider

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:84%
doing chemtrail attacks
or polluting the ocean

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:58.150 align:middle line:84%
or doing sonar so loud that it's
driving the cetaceans crazy.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Right now we're at the tail
end of the old energy which

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.880 align:middle line:84%
is very violent,
and the darkness

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:84%
is kicking and screaming
as it's being escorted out.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even more so, yes.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.579 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: They
showed me the future.

00:34:09.579 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:84%
In the future, we
will tell tales

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.580 align:middle line:84%
to our great grandchildren that
there was a time in our history

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:84%
when there was guns used,
and they won't believe us

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:84%
because that will
be a distant memory.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They will think that's
science fiction.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.610 align:middle line:84%
There will be a
time in our future

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:30.760 align:middle line:84%
when we'll talk about chemtrails
and the powerful people

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
right now who are artificially
making a recession

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.265 align:middle line:84%
and artificially making
wars to get us off our path.

00:34:36.265 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:90%
To help us to forget who we are.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's just a
few very dominant leaders.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And they are
getting their messages

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.710 align:middle line:84%
from their own source,
which is the darkness.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And the whole reason for all
that is to disempower us.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:84%
Because if we would just
stay on the path of light

00:34:54.719 --> 00:35:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and remember who we all are,
and who we are is so powerful,

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and not let ourselves
get distracted

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
by these little dark pony shows
going on over on the side,

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:08.620 align:middle line:90%
then it all works.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.950 align:middle line:90%
We have what we all came for.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's interesting
that you minimalized it

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.365 align:middle line:90%
to small dark pony shows.

00:35:13.365 --> 00:35:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
they're horrible.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.531 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean I have human emotions.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I feel them, and I let myself
feel, and I'm aware of them,

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and I speak up.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons
I'm a vegan because I

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:84%
do my part for helping
with environmental issues.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But to go into fear about it
or to blame others, or anger,

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.177 align:middle line:84%
or give up voting, that
doesn't help anything.

00:35:39.177 --> 00:35:39.760 align:middle line:90%

pretty out of touch
with their feelings,

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.670 align:middle line:84%
because dolphins are beautiful
beings who are intelligent

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and they have cute
eyes, if nothing else,

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and children connect with them.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So someone who's doing
that just for money

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.180 align:middle line:84%
has got to be
really disconnected

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.420 align:middle line:90%
from their emotions.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine they're
using drugs or alcohol

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:20.970 align:middle line:90%
to be numbed out.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.480 align:middle line:84%
If we can raise the vibrations
through our own happiness

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and modeling a
different way of living,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and they can say, wow,
that person, they're happy

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and they're paying their
bills, and they're not

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.717 align:middle line:84%
killing anything to
do it, and they're

00:36:33.717 --> 00:36:35.050 align:middle line:90%
making the world a better place.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I want to be like them.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Then pretty soon,
there aren't people

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:84%
who would club seals or kill
dolphins or do chemtrails,

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:84%
because they all follow
the path that we're

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.625 align:middle line:90%
modeling through happiness.

00:36:46.625 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you really think
that as a collective group

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.670 align:middle line:84%
of people, if enough people
start to think like that,

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:55.320 align:middle line:84%
will continue to
penetrate that, it

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.057 align:middle line:84%
could actually
make a difference?

00:36:57.057 --> 00:36:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It is right now.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:58.990 align:middle line:90%
We're on that path.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:02.440 align:middle line:84%
We were in a fork in the
road before the year 2000,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.230 align:middle line:90%
and we chose the path of light.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And people like yourself who
are in the media perpetuating

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
happy, positive energy,
high vibrating energy,

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.570 align:middle line:90%
are a big part of it, Lisa.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to keep
doing what you're doing.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:14.676 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have to
take a stand for that.

00:37:14.676 --> 00:37:15.720 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely do.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I do take a stand for
staying in the light

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and keeping the
information positive.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.800 align:middle line:84%
It's actually something that
I have a firm, strong belief

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.940 align:middle line:84%
in, and by modeling it,
that I have this ability

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.970 align:middle line:84%
to bring this
information to people.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely take
a stand for that.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, and it
counterbalances the fear energy

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.060 align:middle line:84%
that's also being
broadcast by some

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.790 align:middle line:84%
of the more mainstream
fear-based stations.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, that fear
appeals to the lower vibratory

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.262 align:middle line:84%
kind of reptilian brain
where it goes in and matches

00:37:43.262 --> 00:37:44.220 align:middle line:90%
that level of survival.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.053 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And it gives
someone justification

00:37:46.053 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:84%
for getting drunk
one more night.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if it bleeds, it
leaves, which is absolutely

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.870 align:middle line:84%
what-- it's sexy, and it
appeals, and it brings a--

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.460 align:middle line:84%
It raises certain chemicals in
the body, and fight or flight

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
hormones, and it activates
and motivates people.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, it's the ego.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Fighting the ego
doesn't help anything.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:84%
What does is lifting the energy
and modeling a different way.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.526 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm on
a tangent here.

00:38:12.526 --> 00:38:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: No, I thank
you and Gaiam TV

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.910 align:middle line:84%
for bringing the broadcast
of light and love.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Gaiam TV is very progressive
in that way, where they really

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
are doing what-- this should
be happening in mainstream,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.260 align:middle line:84%
but it's happening
here, and this

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.070 align:middle line:84%
is the new mainstream
in my opinion.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:30.049 align:middle line:84%
All right, there's
another side here.

00:38:30.049 --> 00:38:31.590 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the
sick versus healthy.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah, there we go.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is powerful.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:33.851 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Isn't it?

00:38:33.851 --> 00:38:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Look at the difference between
high vibrating saying "I can"

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.110 align:middle line:90%
versus "I can't."

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.871 align:middle line:84%
I mean this goes back
to our childhood.

00:38:39.871 --> 00:38:42.370 align:middle line:84%
"I think I can, I think I can,"
the little train that could,

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:42.820 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.403 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:43.403 --> 00:38:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So again,
anything that you say

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.190 align:middle line:84%
can be worded in a
positive or high vibrating,

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.260 align:middle line:84%
or negative or
low vibrating way.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.910 align:middle line:84%
When you see these charts, it
just really opens your eyes

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:56.935 align:middle line:90%
and awakens you.

00:38:56.935 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So "I can" has such a
higher vibratory frequency than

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.510 align:middle line:90%
the words "I can't."

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:05.020 align:middle line:84%
We have this in our
household, "I can't" is

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.495 align:middle line:90%
considered a dollar word.

00:39:06.495 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:84%
You have to put a dollar in
the jar every time you say "I

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:90%
can't."

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Love it.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's considered
a bad word in our house.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.117 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: In fact,
Louise Hay, kind

00:39:15.117 --> 00:39:17.840 align:middle line:84%
of to springboard from
this, she pointed out

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that when you say
"I can't wait,"

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:90%
that that is low vibrating.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:22.900 align:middle line:90%
"I can't wait."

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait for next Tuesday.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.104 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait for Christmas.

00:39:26.104 --> 00:39:27.270 align:middle line:90%
When you say "I can't wait."

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But instead to say
"I'm so excited about."

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's higher vibrating.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.975 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are so
many different antidotes

00:39:31.975 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:84%
that you can turn up with
these various things.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.305 align:middle line:90%
So these are negative words.

00:39:36.305 --> 00:39:38.250 align:middle line:90%
These are words like addiction.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:84%
There's the word drugs
you mentioned earlier.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:41.572 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: And worry.

00:39:41.572 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the
lowest vibrating word

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.500 align:middle line:90%
that we came up with.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:49.330 align:middle line:84%
When you say, "I'm worried,"
you are affirming this very low

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:84%
vibration, and the
universe brings you

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.507 align:middle line:90%
more things to worry about.

00:39:53.507 --> 00:39:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.709 align:middle line:84%
So I'm worried about
the state of the world.

00:39:57.709 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:90%
That brings--

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It doesn't
help anything.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It, again, puts
gasoline on the fire.

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Or in this situation, "tension."

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.097 align:middle line:90%
What about the word "anxiety."

00:40:08.097 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean all those words.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:13.240 align:middle line:84%
You can feel your body getting
tense when you say them.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:84%
When you say I'm
anxious and tense,

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.810 align:middle line:84%
you can feel your jaw
muscles get tighter.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And it affects
everyone around you.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Words are like
secondhand smoke, when

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.720 align:middle line:84%
you're saying these really
low vibrations, it's toxic.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is
very well stated.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big proponent of this.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I am a wordsmith as well.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:90%
I love the power of words.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And it also has to do with
your self talk, the words

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.074 align:middle line:90%
that you're not saying, right?

00:40:38.074 --> 00:40:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: The words
you're saying.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:90%
The words you're listening to.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.220 align:middle line:84%
If you're listening to
TV shows or movies that

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.620 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of cussing
and negative words,

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.419 align:middle line:90%
it affects you physiologically.

00:40:47.419 --> 00:40:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It also-- the words
stay inside of closed rooms.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And energy stays inside of
rooms unless they're cleared.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So saying these kind of
words or hearing them indoors

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.750 align:middle line:90%
makes it even more toxic.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I read a book
once that talked about

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.960 align:middle line:84%
if you want to find out what
your negative self talk is,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.020 align:middle line:84%
look at the results
in your life,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
your negative self

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.250 align:middle line:84%
talk is because
it's that powerful.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:14.061 align:middle line:84%
Your behavior will be 100%
of what your self talk is.

00:41:14.061 --> 00:41:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: So true.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is very true.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.806 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what the
positive words look like.

00:41:17.806 --> 00:41:17.895 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yay.

00:41:17.895 --> 00:41:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Love the positive word.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So I say love a lot, and love
is extremely high vibrating,

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:23.960 align:middle line:90%
not surprisingly.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So is prayer, and joy, and bliss
is very, very high vibrating.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.867 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, because
I always ask audiences,

00:41:31.867 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:84%
what do you think the
highest vibrating word

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.420 align:middle line:90%
is, and the always say love.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:84%
But the highest vibrating
words that we found

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.175 align:middle line:84%
is on the next slide,
is this one, peace.

00:41:41.175 --> 00:41:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it really?

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Peace, yeah.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:47.092 align:middle line:84%
And that's our life purpose
right there is to be at peace.

00:41:47.092 --> 00:41:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
interesting, the words

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.500 align:middle line:84%
seem to have
different directions.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.567 align:middle line:84%
Peace is, look at that,
is almost going forward.

00:41:52.567 --> 00:41:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, when
I see that-- yes,

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like a
white dove to me, which

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.300 align:middle line:90%
is the symbol of the word peace.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's so
interesting because it's

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:02.633 align:middle line:84%
going in a direction
which is forward.

00:42:02.633 --> 00:42:05.090 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look
at an NLP timeline,

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that is the forward
direction on the timeline.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
be going forward.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:11.300 align:middle line:90%
That's so interesting.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice that words have
different frequencies of--

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:15.284 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Direction?

00:42:15.284 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do they?

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, we haven't
studied that in depth,

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.029 align:middle line:84%
but we did notice that some
are flying to the right

00:42:21.029 --> 00:42:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and some are flying
to the left, yes.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.994 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you look back
at the positive words, yes.

00:42:24.994 --> 00:42:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are going to
the right and some of them

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.354 align:middle line:90%
are going to the left.

00:42:28.354 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at-- again, I want

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.360 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the
negative words here.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's
really interesting.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.565 align:middle line:84%
When we started
this whole study,

00:42:33.565 --> 00:42:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Grant and I expected that we
would find negative words would

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:84%
have the peak below
the center line,

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and positive words would
have the peak above.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:43.250 align:middle line:84%
That immediately
didn't come true.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.500 align:middle line:84%
The pattern we found was
that the lower the vibration,

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:90%
the tighter they were.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.710 align:middle line:84%
The word "tension" illustrates
the very thing it is.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, very true.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It's very tight
and very compact.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:43:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the positive words
are so much more opened up,

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and they have space,
some space between them.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Breathing room, yup.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.858 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they have
a higher frequency.

00:43:06.858 --> 00:43:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, so I
mean we know from science

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:84%
that if your body's relaxed,
it's healthier for you.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And a big path to
feeling relaxed

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.740 align:middle line:84%
is to say positive
words, such as when

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:84%
we said if you say, "oh,
I don't have enough time,"

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.750 align:middle line:84%
you can feel your
body get tense.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you say "I've
got plenty of time.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll get there exactly at the
divine or perfect moment,"

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.220 align:middle line:90%
you start to relax.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
relaxed, everything

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.720 align:middle line:84%
flows more healthfully
in your body.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.370 align:middle line:84%
You get ideas because
blood flows to the brain.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about manifesting?

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.160 align:middle line:84%
If you say things
like "I have the"--

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.440 align:middle line:84%
do you ask for specific amounts
of money in your experience?

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: You can.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you talk about?

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: You can.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Back in the old
days, my salad days,

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.920 align:middle line:84%
if I had a bill come in I
needed to pay and it was $86.98,

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.535 align:middle line:84%
I would say thank
you, God, for $86.98

00:43:54.535 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and it would magically appear.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your salad days?

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.873 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Salad days
is a term that we

00:43:58.873 --> 00:44:01.230 align:middle line:84%
use when people are just
starting out in their career

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:04.182 align:middle line:84%
and all they have money
for is to eat salads.

00:44:04.182 --> 00:44:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's all I
eat anyway is salad.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:07.190 align:middle line:90%
That's funny.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.847 align:middle line:90%
It was not by choice back then.

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.763 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Lettuce was kind
of the thing we could afford.

00:44:12.763 --> 00:44:14.290 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can ask for
something specific.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.370 align:middle line:84%
You can ask for this or
something better, God.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:21.265 align:middle line:84%
You can say God, you know
what will make me happy,

00:44:21.265 --> 00:44:21.890 align:middle line:90%
bring it to me.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:22.730 align:middle line:90%
As long as you ask.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask for
something from the universe,

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.470 align:middle line:84%
it's very analogous
to ordering something

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.200 align:middle line:90%
at a restaurant from a waiter.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that
you've go to do

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:34.940 align:middle line:84%
is be very clear on what
you want, and then don't

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.690 align:middle line:84%
worry about how it's
going to come to you.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.065 align:middle line:84%
Just like at a
restaurant, if you

00:44:38.065 --> 00:44:41.400 align:middle line:84%
say I want an avocado
sandwich on gluten-free bread,

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.610 align:middle line:84%
you would ask for
that very clearly,

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and then you don't
keep following

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.510 align:middle line:84%
the waiter into the kitchen
asking for it over and over

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:48.150 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.250 align:middle line:90%
That would be insane.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.833 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with the universe.

00:44:50.833 --> 00:44:52.090 align:middle line:90%
You just have to ask once.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:55.189 align:middle line:84%
As long as you ask clearly,
then you don't sit there and go

00:44:55.189 --> 00:44:57.230 align:middle line:84%
well, how are you going
to answer my prayer, God?

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.970 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:44:57.970 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Will I have enough time?

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.647 align:middle line:84%
Will I have enough money to--
That's when we meddle too much.

00:45:03.647 --> 00:45:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I notice that you
do a lot of free events.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.297 align:middle line:84%
You do a lot of
philanthropic events.

00:45:08.297 --> 00:45:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yup.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't have a lot
of tension on money, do you?

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: No.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.747 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you--
explain that to us.

00:45:14.747 --> 00:45:15.663 align:middle line:90%
How do you live with--

00:45:15.663 --> 00:45:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: The thing I
talk to people about

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the ego is
very future oriented,

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:21.810 align:middle line:90%
and the higher self is now.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:25.854 align:middle line:84%
And the ego always does this
thing I call bag lady fears.

00:45:25.854 --> 00:45:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And where people are
afraid that in the future

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:29.311 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
end up as a bag lady

00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:32.440 align:middle line:84%
in the gutter with no money, or
a bag man if it's a man, right.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And the ego loves it
when we buy into that.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The higher self
knows that there's

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.740 align:middle line:84%
an abundance of money and
everything for everyone.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And people say to me
why are people starving?

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is it's
because of this consciousness

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.270 align:middle line:90%
that there's not enough money.

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And the best way we can
help those starving children

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is a) to affirm
abundance for yourself

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:55.050 align:middle line:84%
so that you can send
money to the orphanages

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and you can give money
to homeless people.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's not selfish to manifest.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.717 align:middle line:84%
It's a path to
healing the world.

00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you
just ask for what

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.610 align:middle line:90%
you need as you need it, right?

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Literally, this
one time I was at a place

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.110 align:middle line:84%
with a girlfriend whose
birthday was coming up

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:11.710 align:middle line:90%
and she admired a scarf.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
perfect birthday gift.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And the place that
it was for sale

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.500 align:middle line:84%
didn't take credit
cards or checks, which

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I thought was all
was in my purse,

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and I hadn't brought any cash.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.724 align:middle line:84%
But I just said to my purse,
I need this amount of money--

00:46:24.724 --> 00:46:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To your purse?

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: To my purse.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --to buy this scarf
for my friend, and I reached in

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:90%

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:32.368 align:middle line:84%
And I've done that
countless times.

00:46:32.368 --> 00:46:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.964 align:middle line:90%
You are a manifester.

00:46:34.964 --> 00:46:36.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.963 align:middle line:84%
When we come back,
we're going to talk

00:46:37.963 --> 00:46:41.330 align:middle line:84%
about the specific archangels
and what their meanings are so

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that we can figure out how
to clearly set intentions.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.850 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:50.710 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.170 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Doreen
Virtue, angel therapist.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to learn
now about the archangels

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and where they
show up in history.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Where, historically, have
we learned about archangels?

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, they do go back
to ancient Judaic mysticism,

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.650 align:middle line:84%
including the Kabbalah
and the Zohar.

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And they are a part of
monotheistic tradition.

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.910 align:middle line:10%
So the three
monotheistic religions,

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:19.250 align:middle line:10%
Christianity/Catholicism,
Jewish, and Islamic or Muslim,

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:23.390 align:middle line:10%
they all recognize archangels
as these beings-- who

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.380 align:middle line:10%
I have seen clairvoyantly
since childhood,

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.910 align:middle line:10%
so I can corroborate
that they're

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:31.480 align:middle line:10%
very real-- as
intercessories that

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.910 align:middle line:10%
manage our personal
guardian angels.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So you've got your
own guardian angels.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:38.680 align:middle line:90%
So do I. So does everyone.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
these archangels--

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.300 align:middle line:84%
there's hundreds of them--
who each have a specialty, who

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.130 align:middle line:84%
can also be a guardian
angel to you and help you.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:48.790 align:middle line:84%
They're unlimited
beings, so they

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.640 align:middle line:84%
can be with as many people
as who call upon them.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let me ask you
quickly about the guardian

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.320 align:middle line:90%
angels-- maybe not so quickly.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.531 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask about who
are the guardian angels?

00:47:59.531 --> 00:48:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.513 align:middle line:84%
How does everybody
know they have them?

00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:03.513 align:middle line:90%
How do you connect them?

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
that's part of my work

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:07.200 align:middle line:84%
is telling people they have
angels because a lot of people

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:84%
think they're mythology
or just wishful thinking

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.860 align:middle line:84%
or part of religion, but
they're a part of life.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Just like every human has a
brain and lungs and a heart.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Every human has these entities
with them, these guides, who

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.460 align:middle line:84%
are very pure, who
are trustworthy,

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:26.310 align:middle line:84%
who are direct from love
and life, the creator,

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:27.740 align:middle line:90%
and you come in with them.

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.080 align:middle line:84%
They actually work with
you on your life plan

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:33.690 align:middle line:84%
before you come into your
physical body and you're born.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And they stay with
you your whole life.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And they go back home
with you after you're

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:40.260 align:middle line:84%
done with this being
in the classroom

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.497 align:middle line:90%
experience we call life.

00:48:41.497 --> 00:48:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And then that's how you can
connect with these angels

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to discover your life
purpose, and you can actually

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.599 align:middle line:90%
have a connection with them.

00:48:49.599 --> 00:48:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:51.980 align:middle line:84%
We all do have
connections with them.

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:52.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.366 align:middle line:84%
I mean everyone has had a
gut feeling that either they

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:58.740 align:middle line:84%
ignored or listened to, and
either way you learn from it,

00:48:58.740 --> 00:48:59.270 align:middle line:90%
hopefully.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.561 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know my guardian
angel is a very good driver.

00:49:01.561 --> 00:49:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: OK.

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are
some things that I

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.330 align:middle line:90%
miss that I can't explain.

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, we all
have guardian angels

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:12.010 align:middle line:84%
that are very patient with
us, because most people don't

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.340 align:middle line:90%
listen to their angels.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And most people, they have
doubts about the messages

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.890 align:middle line:90%
they get.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:20.840 align:middle line:84%
The angels talk to all
of us in four ways.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.730 align:middle line:84%
The most common way
they talk to all of us

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:25.380 align:middle line:84%
is through our physical
and emotional feelings.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.161 align:middle line:84%
We call it clairsentience,
or clear feeling.

00:49:28.161 --> 00:49:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.868 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So that's what we
say you get a gut feeling

00:49:30.868 --> 00:49:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or intuition, that's
clairsentience.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.200 align:middle line:84%
You might have an
air pressure change

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that lets you know
an angel's there.

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Or you might have some
sort of goosebumps

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.640 align:middle line:84%
or I call angel
bumps that let you

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.210 align:middle line:84%
know that you're
on the right path.

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:46.157 align:middle line:84%
Physical sensations also
include things you smell.

00:49:46.157 --> 00:49:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, but
sometimes I'll smell roses--

00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --or you'll smell
your grandma's cologne.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.230 align:middle line:84%
They let you know that
the departed loved

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.820 align:middle line:90%
one's with you as well.

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do our angels
ever communicate with us

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:58.995 align:middle line:90%
through numbers or symbols?

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.045 align:middle line:84%
Actually, angel
numbers is something

00:50:02.045 --> 00:50:04.710 align:middle line:84%
that I've written
about and have studied.

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.375 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most common
ways that the angels do

00:50:07.375 --> 00:50:09.650 align:middle line:84%
get our attention
with the physical side

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:13.060 align:middle line:84%
is through showing us
repetitive number sequences

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.590 align:middle line:84%
that we might see in a license
plate or a receipt or telephone

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:17.320 align:middle line:90%
number.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So people will tell me they see
four, four, four all the time,

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.350 align:middle line:84%
which means the
angels are with you.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Or they see one, one, one,
which means watch your thoughts.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Make sure they're positive
because you're manifesting

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:29.270 align:middle line:90%
with your thoughts very quickly.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.103 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:50:30.103 --> 00:50:32.902 align:middle line:84%
So what did 11, 11 mean
in the calendar year?

00:50:32.902 --> 00:50:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It meant just that.

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It meant that now is the
time to rise above fear

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and really think about
what it is you desire,

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:40.880 align:middle line:90%
not what you fear.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
thinking about

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is what you're going
to live with very soon.

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: My husband
sees this all the time,

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure a lot of
people have emailed me

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.840 align:middle line:84%
when you're on the show
talking about sequences

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.375 align:middle line:84%
where the numbers are
all the same, where

00:50:54.375 --> 00:50:56.890 align:middle line:90%
it'll be a series of twos.

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:58.639 align:middle line:84%
Do they all mean
something different?

00:50:58.639 --> 00:51:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: The more you get,
the more emphasis there is,

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and basically two
means keep the faith.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And so if you wake up in
the middle of the night

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.646 align:middle line:84%
and it's 2:22, for
instance, they really

00:51:08.646 --> 00:51:10.020 align:middle line:84%
are trying to get
your attention.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And once you learn the
lesson and get the message,

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:15.240 align:middle line:84%
they'll change to a
different number sequence.

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.104 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Does 734 mean anything?

00:51:17.104 --> 00:51:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: They all
mean something.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is
not a commercial,

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.370 align:middle line:84%
but I have a phone
app now that's

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.880 align:middle line:84%
called Angel Numbers where
you can plug in any number,

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.588 align:middle line:84%
it'll tell you
immediately what it means.

00:51:26.588 --> 00:51:27.555 align:middle line:90%
It's the coolest thing.

00:51:27.555 --> 00:51:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Seriously.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.576 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you come
up with the meanings?

00:51:30.576 --> 00:51:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I just asked and just
wrote down what they told me.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:38.260 align:middle line:10%
So 734 would mean that the
ascended masters and the angels

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:10%
are applauding you because
you're on the right path

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:42.770 align:middle line:10%
and they want you to stay on it.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:43.470 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Really?

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I have seen that number
upside-down and backwards,

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:47.550 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's a
beautiful message.

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sorry.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to ask you.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:50.942 align:middle line:90%
I had to ask.

00:51:50.942 --> 00:51:52.149 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I love the numbers.

00:51:52.149 --> 00:51:53.430 align:middle line:90%
I love doing number readings.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fascinating.

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:55.286 align:middle line:90%
You have a mobile app.

00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.537 align:middle line:84%
Just type in the App Store Angel

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yup.

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and in numerology.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.515 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Pythagoras.

00:52:04.515 --> 00:52:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras said that
everything in the world

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.720 align:middle line:90%
is mathematically precise.

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And he used to have his students
to meditate on the number eight

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.420 align:middle line:84%
because it's a sign of
infinity and abundance,

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.130 align:middle line:84%
to empower his students,
to really awaken

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:21.387 align:middle line:90%
their spiritual gifts.

00:52:21.387 --> 00:52:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And did you pull from
your communication

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.260 align:middle line:84%
with angels and
also ancient history

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.776 align:middle line:84%
to determine the
meanings of the--

00:52:27.776 --> 00:52:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, not to sound too
odd, but in one of my very,

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.610 align:middle line:84%
very strong past life
memories and regressions,

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:36.780 align:middle line:90%
I was a student of Pythagoras'.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.729 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --I have ancient
memories of what he taught.

00:52:39.729 --> 00:52:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't his best
student-- not owning that.

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But by osmosis and being
there I did learn quite a bit.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:49.530 align:middle line:84%
What he taught
was that-- he said

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that there's this
music of the spheres,

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.720 align:middle line:84%
that the whole universe is held
together with this energy that

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is mathematically
precise and that actually

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:59.400 align:middle line:84%
can translate into
things you hear.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And he used musical sound to
heal people in the Asclepius

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:07.840 align:middle line:84%
hospital system, because he said
that each vibration of music

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.830 align:middle line:90%
is mathematically precise.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's all numbers
and it's all sounds.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've seen so
much of that lately

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.167 align:middle line:84%
through sound healing
and sound therapy.

00:53:17.167 --> 00:53:17.792 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:53:17.792 --> 00:53:18.255 align:middle line:90%
It's coming back.

00:53:18.255 --> 00:53:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's--

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's ancient wisdom.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --very much
coming back now,

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's being quantified
and validated scientifically,

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:25.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's fascinating.

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:27.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a big field.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.967 align:middle line:84%
And so symbols--
feathers, animals.

00:53:30.967 --> 00:53:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean are there any specific
symbols that have meaning?

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, actually,
the angels told me one time

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.201 align:middle line:84%
that everything's a message,
everything's a sign.

00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:39.280 align:middle line:84%
If you'll keep your eyes
open and your mind open,

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.142 align:middle line:84%
you'll see them
communicating constantly.

00:53:41.142 --> 00:53:43.600 align:middle line:84%
As you said, that if you want
to know what you're thinking,

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.460 align:middle line:90%
look around you.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of that.

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.740 align:middle line:84%
But the common ones,
of course, like

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.790 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned are
feathers, and they usually

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.577 align:middle line:84%
are feathers in
unusual locations,

00:53:52.577 --> 00:53:54.910 align:middle line:84%
like people will tell me
they're in the hospital praying

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:55.890 align:middle line:90%
for their health.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden this
giant seagull feather

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.500 align:middle line:84%
will show up on the
pillow, and it obviously

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.360 align:middle line:90%
didn't come from the pillow.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Or a woman told me she
was praying for her job,

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.679 align:middle line:84%
and she said, please
send me a feather

00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:08.970 align:middle line:90%
if everything's going to be OK.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And she looks down
and her skirt is

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:14.720 align:middle line:84%
covered in feathers
in an office.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Just weird things
like that happen

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:19.100 align:middle line:90%
when people ask for signs.

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Butterflies or birds
are very common symbols

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:24.550 align:middle line:90%
from our departed loved ones.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.850 align:middle line:84%
As are coins, so finding
pennies or nickels or dimes

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.180 align:middle line:84%
usually is from a
grandfather on the other side

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.064 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of
benevolent relative.

00:54:33.064 --> 00:54:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When my
grandfather passed

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.510 align:middle line:84%
away, a dove flew into the
front door to the house,

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.696 align:middle line:84%
went all the way to the
back into the bathroom,

00:54:39.696 --> 00:54:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and then right back
out the front door.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I love it.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:42.481 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:42.481 --> 00:54:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: These kind of
stories warm my heart.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:47.150 align:middle line:84%
They kind of normalize
the angel experiences

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.450 align:middle line:84%
for people who think it's a
little too weird or scary.

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am sure every
single person watching has

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.154 align:middle line:84%
had some type of experience
they call weird or fluke.

00:54:56.154 --> 00:54:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:57.810 align:middle line:90%
But they're normal.

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:00.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for the last
seven or eight years

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been writing a weekly
column for Women's World

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:03.705 align:middle line:90%
Magazine--

00:55:03.705 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.871 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --which
is a magazine you'd

00:55:05.871 --> 00:55:08.870 align:middle line:84%
buy at the checkout stand of any
grocery store in North America,

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:10.450 align:middle line:90%
and it's a normal magazine.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's got cake
recipes, and it's

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.910 align:middle line:84%
got how to have a
better marriage.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Like you'd seen--

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:17.091 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
define as normal, really,

00:55:17.091 --> 00:55:17.218 align:middle line:90%
when you think about--

00:55:17.218 --> 00:55:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, you
know, kind of mainstream.

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And here in the
middle is this angel article

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:22.713 align:middle line:84%
I write every week
called "My Guardian

00:55:22.713 --> 00:55:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Angel" with channeling.

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:27.440 align:middle line:84%
It's out and out, out of
the closet channeling.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And the publishers
were afraid that it

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.800 align:middle line:84%
would be too weird for their
very mainstream audience.

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So they pulled the column
after about three months of me

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.660 align:middle line:84%
writing it, when
I first started.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, it's
not meant to be.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And they got bags full
of letters-- people who

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:44.650 align:middle line:84%
didn't have email were
writing letters and saying

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.100 align:middle line:90%
where's that angel column?

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.040 align:middle line:84%
We were buying your
magazine to get it.

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:48.727 align:middle line:90%
So it came back.

00:55:48.727 --> 00:55:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And it's
very, very out there.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But the stories usually are
of people who've had a loss,

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and then they start to
see birds or butterflies,

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:02.341 align:middle line:84%
or they hear the song that
was that special connection--

00:56:02.341 --> 00:56:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --on the radio a lot.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.551 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It provides an enormous
amount of healing for someone

00:56:06.551 --> 00:56:09.582 align:middle line:84%
who has lost a loved one
that yearns for that last--

00:56:09.582 --> 00:56:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: That's right.

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --a piece
of communication,

00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:14.340 align:middle line:90%
connection in some way.

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you can-- I mean in
the privacy of your own mind--

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.580 align:middle line:84%
have that type of
connection and make it real,

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and when it
manifests, the healing

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.830 align:middle line:84%
that pours out of people
is-- I've seen it.

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:26.674 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:56:26.674 --> 00:56:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just the tears
and the releasing

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.810 align:middle line:84%
of the pain from
the loss is relieved

00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:34.006 align:middle line:90%
when that symbol comes in.

00:56:34.006 --> 00:56:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to believe it.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.140 align:middle line:90%
You just try it.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it
in rooms of people.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.002 align:middle line:84%
I'm not telling
you anything new.

00:56:41.002 --> 00:56:41.710 align:middle line:90%
You've done this.

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's true though.

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.300 align:middle line:84%
It's very comforting
to know that when

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:47.490 align:middle line:84%
you see a butterfly that
it's a sign from a loved one

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:50.860 align:middle line:84%
who lets you know I've just
transformed, like a caterpillar

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.027 align:middle line:90%
transforms into a butterfly.

00:56:52.027 --> 00:56:54.026 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we've seen
this historically as well.

00:56:54.026 --> 00:56:55.480 align:middle line:90%
We've seen it in hieroglyphics.

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.397 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it in writings
on the walls, right?

00:56:57.397 --> 00:56:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yup, absolutely.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:59.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:04.040 align:middle line:84%
It's communication from spirit
to physical and vice versa.

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And as we continue in
this beautiful new energy,

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.485 align:middle line:84%
we will have more and
more clear communication.

00:57:10.485 --> 00:57:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And the angels tell
me-- they've said

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:15.200 align:middle line:84%
for a long time we'll have
a machine that will measure

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.650 align:middle line:84%
their communication, and
it'll be like calling heaven.

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A machine.

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Like a telephone.

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's something
to come in the future?

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.150 align:middle line:90%
That it's already in works.

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And that we will have machines
that will-- kind of we

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:31.310 align:middle line:84%
have aura photography right
now, but take it to a new level,

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:33.310 align:middle line:84%
almost like a CAT
scan, to show you

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:35.070 align:middle line:84%
where your guides
and angels are.

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And then another machine
that is like-- they

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.720 align:middle line:84%
said it's like a drum, like a
speaker drum that will measure

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.850 align:middle line:84%
a deceased loved one
talking to you that

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:46.850 align:middle line:84%
will go into some sort of
device where you can hear them.

00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:50.056 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm sure many of these
are already being worked on.

00:57:50.056 --> 00:57:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.902 align:middle line:84%
And beyond the current, where
they put a tape recorder

00:57:53.902 --> 00:57:55.360 align:middle line:84%
in a room and they
can hear spirit,

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.290 align:middle line:84%
this is an actual machine
that's controllable experiences.

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of these symbols
and the ancient history

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:05.710 align:middle line:84%
of the archangels is
demonstrated in the new card

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:06.210 align:middle line:90%
deck--

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yay.

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --that you have out.

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at these.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a specific
one that you said

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:15.481 align:middle line:84%
we could pray to a lot, which is
the archangel-- is it Michael?

00:58:15.481 --> 00:58:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Well, Michael.

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But I want to just kind
of back up and just make

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.910 align:middle line:84%
it clear that the angels
don't want to be prayed to

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:22.970 align:middle line:90%
or worshipped.

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.800 align:middle line:84%
They give all glory
to the creator--

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.600 align:middle line:90%
that's who we should pray to.

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.684 align:middle line:90%
But we can call upon them.

00:58:27.684 --> 00:58:28.933 align:middle line:90%
And to me it's very different.

00:58:28.933 --> 00:58:30.270 align:middle line:90%
We don't worship the angels.

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.922 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So Michael
is the right-hand man,

00:58:33.922 --> 00:58:35.380 align:middle line:84%
because each of
these angels either

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.285 align:middle line:84%
have a feminine or
a masculine energy.

00:58:37.285 --> 00:58:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is actually--

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's very masculine.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.235 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Metatron--
sorry about that.

00:58:40.235 --> 00:58:41.193 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: OK, Metatron.

00:58:41.193 --> 00:58:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Metatron is a very
ancient archangel

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.260 align:middle line:84%
who's the primary
angel in the Kabbalah,

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.460 align:middle line:84%
or the Tree of Life
or the Sephirot.

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Metatron was one of two
archangels who was originally

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.980 align:middle line:84%
a human prophet, who was
written about in the Bible.

00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Metatron was Enoch who
ascended, if you recall,

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.300 align:middle line:90%
on a chariot of fire.

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was becoming
an archangel.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Metatron is the first
angel in the Tree

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:12.220 align:middle line:84%
of Life and the
Kabbalah because he

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.490 align:middle line:84%
helped people who were
new on the spiritual path.

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's an archangel all
along the way of the life path.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:19.755 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I didn't know that.

00:59:19.755 --> 00:59:20.770 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --this new deck
is the Angel Tarot cards.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Based on the 78
ancient card system,

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:31.210 align:middle line:84%
like you might see with
the Rider-Waite system,

00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that is very accurate
and very detailed.

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But the traditional
tarot scares most of us

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:37.570 align:middle line:84%
who are sensitive,
because it has

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:39.755 align:middle line:84%
cards depicting
death and hangmen--

00:59:39.755 --> 00:59:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Devils.

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --and tower of
the devils, and pentagrams,

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:44.480 align:middle line:90%
and swords, and bleeding things.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And the messages are
very, very positive

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.940 align:middle line:84%
in most of those
cards, but you have

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to explain it or read
about it or understand it

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:52.910 align:middle line:90%
in order to deal with it.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So Radleigh Valentine
and I-- Radleigh's

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:58.820 align:middle line:84%
an angel therapist and
a medium and good friend

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.530 align:middle line:90%
of mine-- he's a tarot expert.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So he and I came
up with-- modeling

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:08.100 align:middle line:84%
the old system of tarot was
100% gentle, safe and positive

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:08.970 align:middle line:90%
cards.

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the traditional
card of tarot that zero

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.184 align:middle line:90%
is called a fool.

01:00:15.184 --> 01:00:16.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't like being
called a fool.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anyone who does.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So we changed it to
the dreamer, which is actually

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.750 align:middle line:84%
more accurate, because this is
the person who's setting off

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
on a new voyage, very kind
of, some might call it naive,

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.690 align:middle line:90%
but 100% with faith.

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.280 align:middle line:90%
He's walking-- a leap of faith.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And so archangel Metatron
is the perfect archangel

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.610 align:middle line:90%
for starting a new venture.

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Because--

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --each of these--
we assigned archangels

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to each of the, what they
call the major arcanas

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:43.260 align:middle line:90%
part of the tarot.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was perfect because
each of the archangels

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:50.707 align:middle line:84%
had that specialty that fit
that particular message or card.

01:00:50.707 --> 01:00:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.607 align:middle line:84%
So this particular one,
the Archangel Metatron

01:00:53.607 --> 01:00:55.815 align:middle line:84%
is about the dream and it's
about setting intentions.

01:00:55.815 --> 01:00:57.648 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, and
about the leap of faith.

01:00:57.648 --> 01:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And also, Metatron
helps children

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
who are wanting to keep
their spiritual gifts alive

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.480 align:middle line:90%
and awakened.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wonderful angel for
indigos and crystal children

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.390 align:middle line:90%
to call upon.

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This next one
is the Archangel Raziel.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.010 align:middle line:10%
>>VIRTUE: Raziel,
whose name in Hebrew

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:15.435 align:middle line:10%
means the secrets of God,
and who in ancient lore

01:01:15.435 --> 01:01:18.230 align:middle line:10%
is said to sit so closely
to the throne of God,

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:21.030 align:middle line:10%
that he hears all of the
secrets and mysteries

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:22.200 align:middle line:10%
and has written them down.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.200 align:middle line:10%
And has actually taught them
since the time of Adam and Eve,

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.420 align:middle line:10%
has taught all of us how to
deal with the ancient secrets.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.690 align:middle line:10%
So this is the card
of the magician, which

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:38.800 align:middle line:10%
is the card of
mysteries and realizing

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.660 align:middle line:10%
you're powerful, you know a
lot, putting them into action.

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
This card really
means you're ready.

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you don't have
the card deck, these are angels,

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
archangels that we're talking
about that you can set

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:55.070 align:middle line:84%
intentions with when you're
doing your intention ritual,

01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:56.000 align:middle line:90%
whatever that is--

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --you can
call on these--

01:01:57.830 --> 01:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and specifically
call on this energy.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:01.009 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.135 align:middle line:84%
You know you can just
ask God, send an angel.

01:02:03.135 --> 01:02:03.760 align:middle line:90%
That's one way.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But I find it enriches it
to know who the players are.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I have written
about 15 very,

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
very trustworthy and practical
angels that all of us

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.860 align:middle line:90%
can call on.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And, as I've said,
they're unlimited,

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
so you can call on them
and I can call on them

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, and they'll
be with each of us having

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
a unique and
individual experience.

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have
a whole book out.

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:27.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't need the book.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.600 align:middle line:84%
You don't need the
cards to do this.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.099 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:02:29.099 --> 01:02:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I teach about it.

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The cards could be
like flash cards

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.077 align:middle line:84%
to help you know what
the archangels do.

01:02:34.077 --> 01:02:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very good to know.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.284 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting to know.

01:02:36.284 --> 01:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, all this is
based on ancient history.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh yeah.

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:41.144 align:middle line:90%
This is not new age.

01:02:41.144 --> 01:02:41.726 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:02:41.726 --> 01:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: These are
ancient beings that go back

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:46.552 align:middle line:84%
to Babylonian times,
and Mesopotamia.

01:02:46.552 --> 01:02:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This next one is
the archangel Raphael,

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:50.343 align:middle line:84%
one of the ones I hear
you talk about a lot.

01:02:50.343 --> 01:02:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So actually, the
next one I think

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:55.307 align:middle line:84%
is Michael, right,
and the emperor?

01:02:55.307 --> 01:02:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:56.431 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sure.

01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:57.322 align:middle line:90%
Michael.

01:02:57.322 --> 01:02:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

01:02:58.030 --> 01:02:59.321 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: So Archangel Michael.

01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Most people know him,
Archangel Michael

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
is the archangel of strength
and courage and protection.

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And he is-- in the
tarot system, we

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
call him the emperor,
which is a traditional word

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
for the card that has to do
with leadership and organization

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and logic.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get
this card it means

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
it's calling upon you
to step up to the plate

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:22.229 align:middle line:90%
and to be the leader.

01:03:22.229 --> 01:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And Archangel Michael can give
you the courage and confidence

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:25.890 align:middle line:90%
to do so.

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So and also when
you're starting new things

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:30.295 align:middle line:84%
or if you are wanting
to be a leader.

01:03:30.295 --> 01:03:31.580 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.246 align:middle line:84%
You can be the leader
of your household.

01:03:33.246 --> 01:03:35.685 align:middle line:84%
You could be a parent as a
leader, which is important.

01:03:35.685 --> 01:03:36.185 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:36.185 --> 01:03:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Or many of us are being called
to make major changes right

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:39.189 align:middle line:90%
now.

01:03:39.189 --> 01:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you're getting the
gut feeling to make the change,

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:43.860 align:middle line:90%
but your family isn't there yet.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So this card, or calling
on Archangel Michael

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
can help you to step
up to the plate,

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and to say we're
going to move now,

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.739 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to make
this or that change.

01:03:52.739 --> 01:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And he'll give you the
confidence and the support

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.400 align:middle line:90%
to do so.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.858 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you're
an activist, this

01:03:56.858 --> 01:04:00.370 align:middle line:84%
is also a good card for you,
or a good energy for you

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:01.035 align:middle line:90%
to call on.

01:04:01.035 --> 01:04:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if you're
being asked to speak

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.569 align:middle line:84%
your truth very loud
and very powerfully,

01:04:06.569 --> 01:04:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and it might not be
the popular truth

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
or there might be
some individuals who

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
have a vested interest
in the not truth.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're
looking for support.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.718 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And protection,
Michael can help you.

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Protection,
that's very important.

01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:19.804 align:middle line:84%
The next one is the
Archangel Rafael.

01:04:19.804 --> 01:04:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Raphael is the healing angel.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
His name means he who
heels or God heals.

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
card of the lovers,

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:28.520 align:middle line:90%
and it means what it says.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with issues
of intimate relationships.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It also means to, when
you're making decisions

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
about your relationships
or anything else,

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.140 align:middle line:90%
to weigh your options carefully.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You can call on Raphael
to heal anything

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
emotionally or physically.

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:45.380 align:middle line:90%
He can heal your loved ones.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And he's wonderful with pets.

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh really.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:48.685 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
He helps to find
lost dogs, lost cats.

01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:52.790 align:middle line:90%
He helps to heal your pets.

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:55.615 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there an
angel of lost things?

01:04:55.615 --> 01:04:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely.

01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There is.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.505 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:04:57.505 --> 01:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Chamuel.

01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
C-H-A-M-U-E-L. His name in
Hebrew means the eyes of God.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, you might
think it's lost.

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I might think it's lost, but
God can see where everything is.

01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And so calling on Chamuel,
he will absolutely

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
take you to a place
to find it, and you'll

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.879 align:middle line:84%
swear you've looked
there before,

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and that it's illogical
to look there once again.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you will take
the leap of faith

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.347 align:middle line:84%
and go look in that
place, it'll be there.

01:05:22.347 --> 01:05:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So one of the pet peeves
of mine is losing things.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, a lot of
what we are is light workers.

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And light workers have
what I call KeyDD.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.997 align:middle line:84%
Like you lose your car
keys a lot or you're--

01:05:36.997 --> 01:05:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Because it's--
we're used to dealing with

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:41.130 align:middle line:90%
the non-physical world.

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
down here and you

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
have to put things
into places and you

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with
the physical things,

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
it seems so clumsy to all
of us and so unnatural.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's because we remember
the world where we'd just

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.080 align:middle line:90%
think something and it's done.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.455 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I actually was taught
a prayer about St. Anthony,

01:05:58.455 --> 01:05:58.954 align:middle line:90%
and it is--

01:05:58.954 --> 01:05:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --Dear St. Anthony,
come around, what is lost

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:02.240 align:middle line:90%
must be found.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:02.865 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:06:02.865 --> 01:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Every single time we
say that, whatever is lost

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.140 align:middle line:90%
is found.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Exactly.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.574 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's amazing.

01:06:08.574 --> 01:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: St.
Anthony and Chamuel

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:11.520 align:middle line:90%
do the exact same thing.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.187 align:middle line:84%
So I call on both of
them, and it's so fast.

01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Actually,
that's a good point.

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:18.320 align:middle line:84%
The saints that we have
read about historically

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.810 align:middle line:84%
in biblical times are
very much synonymous

01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:24.100 align:middle line:84%
to what you talk about in
terms of the archangels.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Very analogous, yup.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:27.957 align:middle line:84%
So the next one-- oh,
this is a great one.

01:06:27.957 --> 01:06:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yup.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Archangel Raguel.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Raguel, whose name
means the friends of God,

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and is a wonderful
angel to call upon

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:39.749 align:middle line:84%
if there's any kind of
conflict in any relationship

01:06:39.749 --> 01:06:40.540 align:middle line:90%
that you're having.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, this card traditionally
was called the towers in tarot,

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and it created a lot of fear,
especially after September 11.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So we renamed it justice, which
is actually what it stands for.

01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:52.360 align:middle line:90%
We still have the two columns.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
We kept a lot of the
symbols, but we made them

01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:57.510 align:middle line:90%
the solid towers here.

01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:01.505 align:middle line:84%
And so Archangel Raguel says
that-- if you get this card,

01:07:01.505 --> 01:07:05.411 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with fairness and
justice and making decisions.

01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you're in any way
involved in the justice system,

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:09.610 align:middle line:90%
sometimes you find it not fair.

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:10.270 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.511 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --the way that
the laws have gotten

01:07:12.511 --> 01:07:14.700 align:middle line:84%
tweaked throughout the
years, it's very interesting

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.829 align:middle line:84%
to be able to call when you
really want truth to prevail.

01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's really a David
and Goliath moment in our earth

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
history, and
energetically right now.

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So even though it
might seem like there's

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
people in power who have got
it all, tidied everything up.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Really, those of us
who are the Davids

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:33.110 align:middle line:84%
with the little slingshot,
we've got the power.

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
us to know that we

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:36.760 align:middle line:90%
know that we've got the power.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very well said.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:38.732 align:middle line:90%
Very well said.

01:07:38.732 --> 01:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Which actually brings
us to the next card

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.920 align:middle line:90%
which is the card of strength--

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.711 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Strength.

01:07:42.711 --> 01:07:46.407 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and to know that you
can call upon strength when

01:07:46.407 --> 01:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
you're in a situation where
you're looking for fairness.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.948 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, we are made
in the image and likeness

01:07:50.948 --> 01:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
of the strong
creator, and there's

01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:55.190 align:middle line:84%
nothing weak about any
of us, except for if we

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:56.190 align:middle line:90%
think there is.

01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
The angels want us to
simultaneously work

01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
on balancing-- being strong
and sensitive at the same time.

01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:04.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why most of us
are getting the message

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
to take good care of
our bodies, to exercise,

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
even to lift weights, like I
do every day, little weights.

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.070 align:middle line:90%
To keep your body strong.

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
To have your mind strong
by getting chemical-free

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:19.754 align:middle line:84%
so you can focus and not be
wavering with how chemicals

01:08:19.754 --> 01:08:20.920 align:middle line:90%
make you all over the place.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.899 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Also it
keeps you grounded.

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And strong in your boundaries.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.420 align:middle line:84%
If someone's trying to take
advantage of you, to speak up.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can still be nice and
loving and angelic and say no.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, we need
to be sensitive,

01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:38.170 align:middle line:84%
because sensitivity keeps
us dialed in and plugged in

01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:41.040 align:middle line:84%
to the truth and what's
going on in our world.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So this card, strength
card, with Archangel Ariel,

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:47.359 align:middle line:84%
whose name means
the lioness of God.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's about feminine
strength and feminine power,

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
which every man and
woman has access to,

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:56.029 align:middle line:84%
because it's a kind of spiritual
power that we all have.

01:08:56.029 --> 01:08:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you draw this
card, it's reminding

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that you have great
inner strength

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.620 align:middle line:90%
yourself, that you can do it.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:05.979 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's different
than a warrior-like strength.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's a
peaceful warrior, yeah.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a peaceful warrior.

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Coming
from love, not fear.

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:11.829 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there
different energies

01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
with these archangels that
have to do with a warrior

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:18.620 align:middle line:90%
energy versus a loving energy?

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.266 align:middle line:90%
Or do they--

01:09:19.266 --> 01:09:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Well, yeah.

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you look
at, traditionally,

01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:25.229 align:middle line:84%
every painting of archangel
Michael shows him with a sword.

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not a sword of battle,
it's a sword of light

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that helps us to
release the attachments

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.750 align:middle line:90%
or the cords of fear.

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So he would be more of
your traditional warrior

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.060 align:middle line:90%
type of archetype.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And then your softer,
kinder one of archangel

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:44.819 align:middle line:84%
would be such as
Ariel who's got a very

01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
feminine kind of-- her
aura color is light pink.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.319 align:middle line:84%
She's all about love
and kisses and hearts,

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%
and hearth and home and harmony.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're all
about water, aren't you?

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, I am.

01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:58.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm a water baby.

01:09:58.670 --> 01:09:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are.

01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:03.577 align:middle line:84%
I notice there's a card that we
have here, the nine of water.

01:10:03.577 --> 01:10:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of Pisces
in my astrological chart,

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of the
reasons I'm so psychic.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And the nine of
water card actually

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
has an image of me
as a mermaid, which

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.900 align:middle line:84%
is the archetype or the
realm that I most relate to.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I think all of
us have kind of a realm

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that we have lived
in other lifetimes.

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And they might seem
like mythical realms

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%
some people relate to fairies,
some relate to angels,

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
some relate to dragons
or knights or wizards.

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:37.630 align:middle line:90%
I relate to angels.

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:39.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean to mermaids and angels.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, kind of
combine the two.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And water is my
favorite element.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
When I'm swimming in the
ocean, I feel most at home,

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I feel most comfortable,
most connected.

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And my girlfriends
and I actually

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.997 align:middle line:84%
put on mermaid tails that
have monofins in them.

01:10:55.997 --> 01:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, we have
a picture of this.

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.344 align:middle line:90%
You have to check these out.

01:10:59.344 --> 01:11:01.135 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: We swim in
the ocean as mermaids.

01:11:01.135 --> 01:11:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's Doreen.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: So that's me.

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.900 align:middle line:84%
This photo was actually
shot by the ocean artist

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Wyland for a video
that he made of us

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that you can see on YouTube
by typing in Wyland mermaid.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see me swimming
with my girlfriends.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
This is in Kona,
Hawaii, which has

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
very still waters
and good visibility.

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is to bring
awareness of the ocean

01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:27.407 align:middle line:84%
environment and the
plight of the cetaceans.

01:11:27.407 --> 01:11:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Look at you.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.485 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely amazing.

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:30.875 align:middle line:90%
These tails are phenomenal.

01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.990 align:middle line:84%
This was made by
a friend of mine,

01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Mike Van Dall of FlipTails.

01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:39.540 align:middle line:84%
They are very heavy tails, but
in the water they're neutral,

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:40.650 align:middle line:90%
they're weightless.

01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
They allow you to--
we go to about 60 feet

01:11:43.570 --> 01:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
underwater in these
tails on one breath.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:49.936 align:middle line:84%
And these are tails
that you can--

01:11:49.936 --> 01:11:51.560 align:middle line:84%
you have about seven
or eight of these.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: You've
seen one of them.

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I have.

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: We were on the
Caribbean Hay House cruise--

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --with this.

01:11:56.170 --> 01:11:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was with your beautiful
daughter who's a mermaid, too--

01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:11:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --swimming in
the ocean in these tails.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.901 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: She wants
one of those tails.

01:12:02.901 --> 01:12:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Anyone
can do this, yeah.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.710 align:middle line:84%
You can go on eBay and type
in swimmable mermaid tail

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and find the introductory
ones for $100 or so.

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All of you goddesses
watching right now,

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.525 align:middle line:84%
you need to have
that experience.

01:12:14.525 --> 01:12:15.233 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: You do.

01:12:15.233 --> 01:12:18.134 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is I'd say I've
taken free diving classes.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:19.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
try this at home

01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
without getting some
safety instruction from--

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thanks for saying that.

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --a qualified
free diving instructor.

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.789 align:middle line:84%
But the experience that you must
feel going through the water.

01:12:27.789 --> 01:12:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh.

01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, just in a nutshell, I'm
a dive master, with Patty,

01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:33.150 align:middle line:90%
as a scuba diver.

01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And I used to be scuba diving
three or four times a week.

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Once I got a mermaid
tail on, I've

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.445 align:middle line:84%
only been scuba diving
maybe twice since then.

01:12:41.445 --> 01:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
It's so much more fun
to go in the water

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
without a mask or any
equipment, except for the tail,

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and just be so fluid and
be one with the ocean.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It really brings up
memories of Atlantis for me.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I actually
remember a specific time

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
where you and I were
on a cruise ship,

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and we were sailing
over Atlantis

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.180 align:middle line:84%
at the very moment you
and I were talking.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:02.555 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Beautiful.

01:13:02.555 --> 01:13:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you remember this?

01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And we were sailing over
the area where there--

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Bermuda.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And historically,
it was a moment

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.610 align:middle line:90%
that imprinted in my mind.

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:11.818 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's very powerful.

01:13:11.818 --> 01:13:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very powerful.

01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: You know the time
of Atlantis, a lot of mistakes

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.910 align:middle line:84%
were made that we came back
to correct in this lifetime.

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
We gave over power
to the government

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that was trying to grab all the
land masses with crystal energy

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:26.140 align:middle line:90%
power.

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And they imploded our
land mass in doing so.

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we've come back
and we're watching

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
the same selfish behavior
in politicians again.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:35.907 align:middle line:84%
And this time we're
going to speak up.

01:13:35.907 --> 01:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And these stories
give us an example

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to learn from as well,
because we look back

01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and those times and those
stories that tell us this

01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:45.300 align:middle line:84%
is what it means
to lose your power,

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and this is what it feels
like to have your power.

01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: From a place of love.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.816 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: From a
place of love, yes.

01:13:49.816 --> 01:13:51.680 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely a
different source of power.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, and it's the
only form of power there is.

01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's coming
from a place of love

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
has the absolute power
that always sustains.

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:05.180 align:middle line:84%
If you are trying to
fight fear with fear,

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:06.797 align:middle line:90%
you're both gonna lose.

01:14:06.797 --> 01:14:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It's that competition
that doesn't really

01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:10.670 align:middle line:90%
service any longer.

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:12.566 align:middle line:84%
I mean I could talk
to you all day.

01:14:12.566 --> 01:14:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It's so great that there
are so many examples

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:16.545 align:middle line:84%
that you give that
are practical.

01:14:16.545 --> 01:14:17.211 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

01:14:17.211 --> 01:14:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That even if people
have no idea about angels,

01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
have never heard about angels
before this conversation,

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.670 align:middle line:84%
these are thoughts
and ideas that I'm

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
sure are connecting with
people and making it practical.

01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:29.105 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just
to start at home.

01:14:29.105 --> 01:14:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Well, yeah.

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
is I respect people

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:36.760 align:middle line:84%
who are skeptical of angels,
because they have not realized

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
they've had angel
experiences yet.

01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to convert anyone
or convince anyone of anything.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually here to teach how
to have your own experiences

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
so you can make
up your own mind.

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what I tell people
is be like a good scientist.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Experiment with this
hypothesis I'm presenting,

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
there are angels, before you
either accept or reject it.

01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And so a good way to
experiment is ask your angels

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.890 align:middle line:84%
for help with something,
and you can say it

01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:02.554 align:middle line:84%
from a place of
challenging them.

01:15:02.554 --> 01:15:03.220 align:middle line:90%
They don't care.

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:03.340 align:middle line:90%
They--

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:04.589 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --see past it.

01:15:04.589 --> 01:15:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And they will help
you, and then you'll

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.380 align:middle line:90%
make your own conclusions.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.002 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a great thing.

01:15:10.002 --> 01:15:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad
you just said that.

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah!

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I often forget about the
skeptical perspective,

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.110 align:middle line:90%
and it's very important.

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I love skeptics as well.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:19.735 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And they'll help with
anything that brings you peace.

01:15:19.735 --> 01:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
They'll give you a taxi cab
on a rainy night at 5 o'clock

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:23.130 align:middle line:90%
rush hour.

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:24.880 align:middle line:84%
They will help you to
get a parking place.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.872 align:middle line:84%
They'll help you to
pay the mortgage.

01:15:26.872 --> 01:15:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is you need help
with that will give you peace,

01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:30.480 align:middle line:90%
they'll help you with.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.905 align:middle line:84%
They are not wish granters, but
they will give you the guidance

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:35.960 align:middle line:84%
so that you can help
yourself to get there.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to listen to when
they tell you to do something

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.180 align:middle line:90%
after you ask for help.

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
They might say, OK, drive
here, or call this person,

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
or apply for a job here.

01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow
their guidance,

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
you will make your
wish come true.

01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just try it.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just an example.

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Misery refunded
in full if it doesn't work.

01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good way of saying it.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, what are the
aspects of the air,

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:03.050 align:middle line:84%
the water, the fire
in the tarot deck?

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:04.341 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, it's interesting.

01:16:04.341 --> 01:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
In traditional tarot, of
course, air is swords,

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's where you get all
those cards with bleeding

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.170 align:middle line:84%
hearts and people
in pools of blood,

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's just too
scary and harsh,

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
especially since we're all
becoming more sensitive.

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So we found that
we could substitute

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
all of these for
something that's gentler.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.520 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the water
suit is traditionally

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
cups, which we have in this
deck because cups are gentle.

01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But we thought why not
have mermaids symbolize--

01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --the suit of water.

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And for air, instead of
swords, what about unicorns?

01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:40.175 align:middle line:84%
Their horns can
symbolize swords.

01:16:40.175 --> 01:16:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And we also found
that we could put the border

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:47.220 align:middle line:84%
to symbolize-- so we
have blue for air,

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.610 align:middle line:90%
and we have turquoise for water.

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Earth we have fairies,
and we have green.

01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And then for the element of--

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fire.

01:16:57.270 --> 01:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: --fire, we took
friendly, happy dragons.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've never put dragons in
any of my card decks before.

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So I worked very, very closely
with the artist Steve A.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Roberts, because he's
a fantasy artist who's

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
used to a little more intense
emotions in his characters,

01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:16.390 align:middle line:84%
to come up with something
in between harsh dragons

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:17.320 align:middle line:90%
and Barney.

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Something in the middle.

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.670 align:middle line:84%
My role, when we made this
deck of angel tarot cards,

01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:26.470 align:middle line:84%
was that all the paintings
had to feel safe to me,

01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
because I'm highly
sensitive to energy.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the art is amazing.

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:30.463 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you.

01:17:30.463 --> 01:17:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Steve A. Roberts is a genius.

01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, what is
significance, again,

01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:36.986 align:middle line:90%
of the air?

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, air has
to do with intellect.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So these are all cards that have
to do with thinking and making

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:43.130 align:middle line:90%
decisions, et cetera.

01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:45.713 align:middle line:84%
And then what about the
significance of the earth?

01:17:45.713 --> 01:17:49.472 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: The earth has to
do with your daily life.

01:17:49.472 --> 01:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you're
using these cards,

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:53.122 align:middle line:84%
when those particular
cards come up,

01:17:53.122 --> 01:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
you would know that
this has to do with--

01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --daily routine.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And water has to
do with emotions, exactly.

01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then
fire has to do with?

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Fire has
to do with challenges

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:04.174 align:middle line:84%
and overcoming them and moving
forward, energy in your life.

01:18:04.174 --> 01:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then once again,
if we don't have these cards,

01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:middle line:90%
there's a way to set intentions.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah.

01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the best ways is as
you're falling asleep at night.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that
when you're asleep,

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.370 align:middle line:90%
your ego is also kind of asleep.

01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you're more
open to receiving help

01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:21.360 align:middle line:84%
from your guides
and your angels.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I love calling on Archangel
Michel as I'm falling asleep.

01:18:24.670 --> 01:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And he's the loudest
angel of them

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
all-- easiest one for
beginners to work with.

01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And all you do is just ask him
a question or ask him for help

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:35.690 align:middle line:84%
as you're falling asleep, and
he'll come into your sleep

01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and teach you and
give you guidance

01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:41.290 align:middle line:84%
as to how you can correct
a situation or heal it.

01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up,
you may not remember,

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
you probably won't
remember the dream,

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:47.060 align:middle line:84%
but it will be in your
unconscious mind helping

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to steer you in that direction.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you hear the
voices coming back to you?

01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:55.020 align:middle line:84%
How do you decipher whether it's
the angels or your imagination?

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.644 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, in
my surveys, and I've

01:18:56.644 --> 01:18:58.940 align:middle line:84%
gone around the world
since 1996 many times,

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and I've surveyed audiences in
all these different cultures.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.120 align:middle line:84%
My surveys have shown
that the number one way

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.390 align:middle line:84%
people get angel messages
is through feelings.

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So listen to your body
is the number one thing.

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
If it gets tense,
there's a reason.

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
If you get excited
there's a reason.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
If you have a feeling that
something's not right,

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.610 align:middle line:90%
trust that.

01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Never, ever say, oh, it's just
a feeling I have or write it off

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.469 align:middle line:90%
as being less than authentic.

01:19:24.469 --> 01:19:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So trust it more.

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:27.400 align:middle line:90%
And is that also your intuition?

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: That is what
intuition is, is your feelings.

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:31.700 align:middle line:84%
The second most
common way people

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.230 align:middle line:84%
get messages is
through their visions,

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and that includes
visions in your head.

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And visions you
see, like we talked

01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:40.690 align:middle line:84%
about numbers and feathers
and butterflies and birds,

01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:42.380 align:middle line:90%
but it also includes dreams.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
So trust what you see.

01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:46.920 align:middle line:84%
If it's repetitive-- let's
say that three times in a day

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
you see the same word
or you see the same book

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
or the same movie, that's them
trying to get your attention.

01:19:56.050 --> 01:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
The third and fourth most common
way that people get messages

01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:01.640 align:middle line:84%
is through thoughts
or downloaded ideas,

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
wordless words, and
things that they hear.

01:20:04.770 --> 01:20:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Those are pretty rare ways
of getting angel messages.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that how you do
your books, your writing?

01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, we
all get all four ways,

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.749 align:middle line:84%
but there's a primary and
a secondary and a tertiary

01:20:15.749 --> 01:20:17.040 align:middle line:90%
and a fourth way that you get--

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For each person.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: --for each person.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like a four
cylinder automobile.

01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And the primary clair
is the first cylinder

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
that fires for you.

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
For me, the first
cylinder I get is visual.

01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:29.470 align:middle line:90%
So I see things.

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:31.010 align:middle line:90%
And then I also hear things.

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm a real clear
hearer, clairaudience.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So I put myself through college
as a secretary taking dictation

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.280 align:middle line:90%
for my bosses.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I still do that through my
boss God and Archangel Michael.

01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:43.219 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: They dictate
all my books to me.

01:20:43.219 --> 01:20:44.700 align:middle line:90%
It's how I'm so prolific.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And usually what I turn in
is published first draft.

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have a lot of books.

01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: More
than I know, yeah.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.990 align:middle line:84%
More than my
birthdays, I know that.

01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you put my
name in amazon.com,

01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:58.590 align:middle line:84%
they come up so many
books it makes me tired

01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
to think that I
wrote all of them.

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.020 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't.

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:01.890 align:middle line:90%
I channeled them.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I heard the words.

01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So for anyone who
has writer's block or wants

01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:06.660 align:middle line:90%
to write a book--

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Trust what you feel, trust what
you see, trust what you think,

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and trust what you hear.

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And just write it without
editing it or censoring it,

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.520 align:middle line:90%
even if it makes no sense.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my books,
particularly Angel Therapy,

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.100 align:middle line:90%
that book was a channel book.

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.180 align:middle line:84%
At the time I wrote it,
I was not spiritually

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:25.130 align:middle line:90%
mature enough to understand it.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.767 align:middle line:90%
Now I do.

01:21:25.767 --> 01:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you look
back on it and say

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:28.790 align:middle line:84%
how could I have written
that at that time?

01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:30.472 align:middle line:90%
I just trusted it.

01:21:30.472 --> 01:21:32.930 align:middle line:84%

have books in them--

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.172 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --who can really write--

01:21:35.172 --> 01:21:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: We need those--

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.686 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --their stories.

01:21:35.686 --> 01:21:36.561 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Books, too.

01:21:36.561 --> 01:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
The angels say each time a
book of love is published,

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
it's like a stair on
the stairway to heaven.

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
It helps us all.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter if other
people have written about it,

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:50.830 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes people need
to read 10 or 11 different books

01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
on the topic before they
go ah-ha, this is real.

01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's also
your story, to tell

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
your story is so important, and
it's such a historical thing

01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.600 align:middle line:90%
to do as well.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
We've done it for eons, in
terms of being storytellers.

01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:03.460 align:middle line:90%
We are storytellers.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: We are.

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And Archangel Gabriel
is the messenger angel,

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
the famous angel from
the Christmas story

01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
who helps us to tell our story,
whether it's on TV or radio

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:15.550 align:middle line:90%
or through the written word.

01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:18.565 align:middle line:84%
Call on Gabriel to move
past writer's block

01:22:18.565 --> 01:22:22.149 align:middle line:84%
or procrastination, or fears of
failure, or fears of success.

01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very interesting.

01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:25.023 align:middle line:84%
So for anyone who might
have writer's block,

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:27.240 align:middle line:84%
to sit down in a
space, like what do you

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.510 align:middle line:90%
recommend, and call on?

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Just say Archangel
Gabriel, help me to write.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And that angel, I
want to warn everyone,

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.130 align:middle line:90%
is what I call a nudging angel.

01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel will push you
past your comfort zone,

01:22:38.710 --> 01:22:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and may ask you to stay
up all night long writing

01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:42.662 align:middle line:90%
till the thing is done.

01:22:42.662 --> 01:22:43.620 align:middle line:90%
But you've been warned.

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.786 align:middle line:84%
If you want to move past
writer's block, guaranteed,

01:22:45.786 --> 01:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
call on Gabriel and you
will, you will start writing.

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:51.285 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do these books
come to you, or do you--

01:22:51.285 --> 01:22:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I see the whole book
in its entirety.

01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:56.080 align:middle line:90%
I get the energy of it.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.420 align:middle line:90%
The essence of it.

01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I see the title, I see
the cover, I see it all.

01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, Reid Tracy,
the president of Hay House,

01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:04.630 align:middle line:90%
now trusts my visions.

01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:07.091 align:middle line:84%
And when I have a vision,
he goes, OK, go for it.

01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Go ahead and write it.

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So a lot of times I'm
working on three or four books

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.410 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And the other thing
I want to say to writers

01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:17.120 align:middle line:84%
is that the ego tries to
tell you that in the future

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.350 align:middle line:84%
you'll have all
this time to write.

01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's a mistake.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Anything about the future that's
fear-based is the ego's domain.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, I write almost
every book in little five

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.050 align:middle line:84%
minute increments
here and there.

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.262 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you mean?

01:23:30.262 --> 01:23:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: We all have
spare moments in the day.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And you can
write a page a day.

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:36.580 align:middle line:84%
If you write a page a day,
in a year, you've got a book.

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.871 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So moments of epiphany.

01:23:37.871 --> 01:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
You just put them down.

01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:39.912 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Or non-epiphany.

01:23:39.912 --> 01:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
If you have a spare
moment-- let's

01:23:41.370 --> 01:23:42.994 align:middle line:84%
say you're waiting
in line at the bank.

01:23:42.994 --> 01:23:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

01:23:44.130 --> 01:23:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Keep a pad of
paper with you at all times.

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:50.254 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that you're going
to speak into a recorder

01:23:50.254 --> 01:23:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to later type it.

01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:52.717 align:middle line:90%
You won't.

01:23:52.717 --> 01:23:53.675 align:middle line:90%
You've got to write it.

01:23:53.675 --> 01:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It's got to physically
be in front of your eyes.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.473 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

01:23:56.473 --> 01:23:58.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a great tip for writers.

01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean even one who
is not a writer,

01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to be able to put down your
story of your family history,

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
or things that you've
learned, or if you

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.465 align:middle line:84%
want to share this
with generations.

01:24:08.465 --> 01:24:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:09.246 align:middle line:90%
And once--

01:24:09.246 --> 01:24:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a great idea.

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: You start
writing, it'll keep flowing.

01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the first word
is what's most important.

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Once you write that first
word, the rest will come.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very interesting.

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:19.540 align:middle line:90%
So you live your life like this.

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Reading energies
and going with flows,

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and reading and
seeing where things

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.420 align:middle line:84%
are correct and not
correct for you.

01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:29.214 align:middle line:84%
Do you set every day,
do you set an intention?

01:24:29.214 --> 01:24:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Never.

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You never do?

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:30.731 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: No.

01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:32.140 align:middle line:90%
That's too static.

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:33.800 align:middle line:90%
To me that's kind of old energy.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm really-- I'm
100% in the moment.

01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:38.760 align:middle line:90%
100% in the moment.

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.155 align:middle line:84%
And my only intention is
to enjoy this moment 100%.

01:24:42.155 --> 01:24:44.405 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to take care of
your body in the meantime.

01:24:44.405 --> 01:24:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.091 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If it's tired or
hungry, you sleep and you eat.

01:24:47.091 --> 01:24:50.136 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, that's
like a habit now.

01:24:50.136 --> 01:24:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Every day, I brush my
teeth and I exercise.

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:55.130 align:middle line:90%
They're non-optional activities.

01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't argue with myself
should I exercise today or not.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:00.755 align:middle line:84%
Nor do I argue do I brush
my teeth today or not.

01:25:00.755 --> 01:25:01.464 align:middle line:90%
You just do it.

01:25:01.464 --> 01:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I consider it a
privilege, absolutely.

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Ah.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, I do.

01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:08.815 align:middle line:84%
I consider exercising
a big privilege,

01:25:08.815 --> 01:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and I do it every day,
too, because it helps.

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I don't
know how people

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:13.010 align:middle line:90%
are happy without exercise.

01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:14.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's the reset button.

01:25:14.665 --> 01:25:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:18.480 align:middle line:84%
We talked about energy
is so intense right now.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Everyone I know is on overload.

01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's moving and changing.

01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:23.931 align:middle line:90%
Exercise keeps you sane.

01:25:23.931 --> 01:25:25.305 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It is the
only way to set

01:25:25.305 --> 01:25:27.490 align:middle line:84%
the reset button and your
body and on your mind,

01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
because the brain
chemical's released

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
that create opiates in the body,
it creates a cascade effect

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
in the body that puts you
back to that normal state.

01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:35.260 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Right.

01:25:38.987 --> 01:25:39.488 align:middle line:90%
There is.

01:25:39.488 --> 01:25:41.236 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: No matter

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:42.626 align:middle line:84%
in, there's
something you can do.

01:25:42.626 --> 01:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Walking
20 minutes a day.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Or getting in
the ocean or the pool,

01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:49.160 align:middle line:90%
if you've got back challenges.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Or working the upper body
if you've got lower body

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:52.160 align:middle line:90%
challenges.

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Or yoga.

01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:54.574 align:middle line:90%
Gaiam, of course is--

01:25:54.574 --> 01:25:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:55.865 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

01:25:55.865 --> 01:25:59.740 align:middle line:84%
I use Gaiam yoga products all
the time, because yoga to me

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.490 align:middle line:84%
really centers me and
helps me to release

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and keeps the psychic
channels open.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And yoga and fitness
is the basis of Gaiam,

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very important
part of all of our lives,

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:13.240 align:middle line:84%
which I love, the emphasis
that they put on the physical.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And we've spent such a
wonderful time today with you

01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
on the non-physical,
on the ethereal,

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.180 align:middle line:84%
on the intentionality
of life, and I so

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:23.310 align:middle line:84%
appreciate you
being with me today.

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you, Lisa.

01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:26.780 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is
a beautiful purpose,

01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:28.585 align:middle line:84%
and God bless you
and protect you

01:26:28.585 --> 01:26:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and continue this
way for a long time.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I feel very, very, very
blessed to be here with you.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask you if you could
help us with just an intention,

01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:40.860 align:middle line:84%
just to go out with setting
an intention for all of us,

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to invite the
people watching to go ahead

01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and if they could,
if you could think

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of something in your
world or in your life

01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to
set an intention with.

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And Doreen's going to take
us through a little bit

01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
of an intention
setting exercise here.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:57.695 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely.

01:26:57.695 --> 01:27:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is based on what the
angels told me that worry never

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:03.770 align:middle line:84%
helps anything, but
prayer always does.

01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And so anything you're
worried about, just

01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:08.060 align:middle line:84%
stick the words
"please God, help me

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
with this" in front of the
worry and then it's a prayer.

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So just take a
moment and scan your body

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.870 align:middle line:90%
for what are you worried about?

01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:19.390 align:middle line:84%
What are you feeling
anxious about,

01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
whether it's personally
or globally or yourself

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.400 align:middle line:90%
or the future.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.465 align:middle line:90%
And let's just breathe together.

01:27:26.465 --> 01:27:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And let's stick those
words, "please God,

01:27:29.610 --> 01:27:32.680 align:middle line:90%
help me with this."

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And as you release this
worry into the divine,

01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere, which
is the infinite wisdom that

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
has all solutions in mind,
that knows exactly how this is

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:47.850 align:middle line:84%
resolved right now--
not in the future--

01:27:47.850 --> 01:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
but knows that in
spiritual truth,

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
everything is in divine
and perfect order.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything's healed and
healthy, despite illusions.

01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:59.555 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you go to
a frightening movie,

01:27:59.555 --> 01:28:02.410 align:middle line:84%
it can really create real
fear, but on the inside

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:04.330 align:middle line:90%
it's just a movie.

01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is our
moment to connect

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.920 align:middle line:84%
with the infinite
wisdom and intelligence

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that 100% healing love regarding
the situation that you're

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.440 align:middle line:90%
praying about.

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.410 align:middle line:84%
As you tap into
that, you become part

01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:20.300 align:middle line:90%
of the solution for all of us.

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.330 align:middle line:90%
You life us all up.

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:25.220 align:middle line:84%
You are becoming a
role model of peace,

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
just by doing this
this very moment.

01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:29.280 align:middle line:90%
We thank you for this.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's take in a deep inhale
of this collective energy

01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:36.050 align:middle line:84%
of all of us meditating
and praying together

01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:38.920 align:middle line:84%
with all of our
guides and angels.

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And on the exhale,
please let go of anything

01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that you are done
with, that you're

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:46.890 align:middle line:84%
tired of that you want
to let go of and release.

01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:47.950 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:51.079 align:middle line:90%


01:28:51.079 --> 01:28:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's called letting
go and letting God.

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.400 align:middle line:84%
When you let go and let God,
the ego's control issues

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
are released, and that's
when real guidance comes in.

01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It's from that place
of higher wisdom.

01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It sees the big picture.

01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And real control comes
from letting go of control.

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:13.246 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true power.

01:29:13.246 --> 01:29:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: The power of love.

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.607 align:middle line:84%
And you've got it, and I've got
it, and everyone watching this

01:29:17.607 --> 01:29:20.379 align:middle line:90%
has got it right now.

01:29:20.379 --> 01:29:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: God bless us all.

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:23.515 align:middle line:90%
God bless this world.

01:29:23.515 --> 01:29:27.447 align:middle line:90%
Namaste, and peace to us all.

01:29:27.447 --> 01:29:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you.

01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I got the chills
all through the left side

01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:34.480 align:middle line:84%
of my body, and, as you
called them, angel bumps.

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Angel bumps, yeah.

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I really, with all of
my heart, appreciate

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:46.940 align:middle line:84%

you are, the example that you

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:50.100 align:middle line:84%

multi-dimensional way.

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate what
you bring to us

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.837 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the ethereal
and the practical.

01:29:53.837 --> 01:29:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you.

01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:55.901 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are a gift.

01:29:55.901 --> 01:29:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, thank you, Lisa.

01:29:57.150 --> 01:30:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you, the
Aware Show, Gaiam, Hay House,

Thank you.

We all work together.

01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:07.800 align:middle line:90%

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.480 align:middle line:84%
