00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.788 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.057 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that
22% of the healing

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:10%
of all breast cancer
cases is attributed

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.562 align:middle line:10%
to spontaneous remissions?

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.297 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that there's
a way to scientifically

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:34.868 align:middle line:10%
validate healing hands using a
specific type of photography?

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.571 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that you can
learn to do this yourself?

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.539 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me today
to help us explore

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.676 align:middle line:84%
the power of reconnected
healing is internationally

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:45.045 align:middle line:90%
recognized healer, Eric Pearl.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Not only has Eric spoken
by invitation at the United

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.384 align:middle line:84%
Nations, he's presented to a
full house at Madison Square

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Garden, he's been interviewed
in various publications,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.821 align:middle line:90%
including "The New York Times."

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:58.525 align:middle line:84%
But he experienced an overnight
shift in his healing abilities

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.928 align:middle line:90%
he calls Reconnective Healing.

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.329 align:middle line:84%
Eric is here to
share this with us.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.298 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.933 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for having
me on the show.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.869 align:middle line:84%
You have contributed so
much to people's healing.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure to have you here
to learn about your life story.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.777 align:middle line:84%
What was life like
as a young child?

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.111 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
you had healing

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.279 align:middle line:90%
abilities when you were young?

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.316 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I
noticed anything

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:24.885 align:middle line:84%
particularly different,
particularly distinct.

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:30.357 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you, I was born
through a strange process.

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:32.326 align:middle line:10%
My mother died
giving birth to me

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.795 align:middle line:10%
and came back to life at a
time where that type of thing

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.232 align:middle line:10%
was not discussed, the life
after death experience.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.402 align:middle line:10%
We didn't have Elisabeth
Kubler-Ross or Raymond Moody

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.372 align:middle line:10%
or Dannion Brinkley or
any of the other people

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:46.372 align:middle line:10%
who speak about it.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:50.676 align:middle line:84%
And I believe when I was around
six, give or take a year,

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:84%
she shared her experience with
me and all of the insights

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.483 align:middle line:84%
that she learned
in that process.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.551 align:middle line:90%
You remember that at six.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.654 align:middle line:84%
It was really
quite interesting.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:03.323 align:middle line:84%
You see, she was--
I'll do this briefly,

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:06.526 align:middle line:84%
but she was on the
delivery table.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:10.663 align:middle line:84%
And she felt and heard the sound
of motors starting at her feet,

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.399 align:middle line:84%
moving up to her
ankles and her knees.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.668 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't understand
why no one else in the room

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.436 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be responding to it.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.704 align:middle line:84%
And it kept climbing
up in her body.

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:21.074 align:middle line:84%
And she knew that if
it got to her heart

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.109 align:middle line:90%
that it would be the end.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.012 align:middle line:84%
And she just couldn't get
anyone's attention to stop it.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:27.714 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing she
knows, it was at her heart

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.449 align:middle line:90%
and she had left her body.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.119 align:middle line:84%
And she started
passing through levels

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.654 align:middle line:90%
of spirit or being or souls.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:38.191 align:middle line:84%
The first layer were
people who hadn't realized

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.359 align:middle line:90%
that their life was quite over.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.662 align:middle line:84%
They felt incomplete, that they
still more things to do here.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:45.365 align:middle line:84%
The second layer or level of
people she doesn't recall.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.701 align:middle line:84%
The third one was the only
one that was uncomfortable.

00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:50.871 align:middle line:84%
It was uncomfortable to pass
through and uncomfortable

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.672 align:middle line:90%
for the people on that level.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.409 align:middle line:84%
And those were the people who
did the only one thing that we

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.312 align:middle line:84%
can do to temporarily
interrupt, shall we say,

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:02.215 align:middle line:84%
God's plan, which was they
had taken their own life.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.751 align:middle line:84%
And she did get a
sense that eventually

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.088 align:middle line:84%
they would step back into the
system and continue moving.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:10.724 align:middle line:84%
She eventually found
herself up at a light,

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:14.795 align:middle line:84%
at a level where she
was being drawn down

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:17.831 align:middle line:84%
a lane towards a bright
light, which is what she feels

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.766 align:middle line:84%
most people speak
about as a feeling

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:22.035 align:middle line:90%
of moving through a tunnel.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.904 align:middle line:84%
Her feet weren't
moving, but she was

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:25.739 align:middle line:90%
gliding down towards that lane.

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.544 align:middle line:84%
She was passing and seeing
colors-- flowers of colors

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:33.814 align:middle line:84%
she had never before
seen, seeing people

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:36.316 align:middle line:84%
from her current
lifetime and recognizing

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.585 align:middle line:84%
the roles that we all play
in one another's lifetime.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.153 align:middle line:84%
This is all while
giving birth to you?

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:40.853 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.256 align:middle line:84%
They were sort of
guiding the way,

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.392 align:middle line:84%
intimating the way to
move towards the light.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.561 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to look at the
light because it was so bright.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.596 align:middle line:84%
She was afraid that it
would hurt her eyes.

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.964 align:middle line:90%
But she felt compelled to look.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.834 align:middle line:84%
And when she did look, she
found that it didn't her eyes

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.303 align:middle line:84%
and that there was nothing
physical to hold onto.

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.405 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly she was
imbued with insights,

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.608 align:middle line:84%
how ridiculous it is for us to
judge others in the way that

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
they look physically,
why the world is round,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.715 align:middle line:84%
why grass is green,
why the sky is blue,

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:14.788 align:middle line:84%
how we cannot judge even God
for things that are seemingly

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
unexplainable, such
as drive-by shootings,

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.994 align:middle line:84%
how utterly absurd it is for
young men and women to go out

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.897 align:middle line:84%
losing their lives fighting
battles for older men

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.532 align:middle line:84%
and women and
governments, that war is

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.334 align:middle line:90%
a temporary state of barbarism.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:28.902 align:middle line:84%
You're recounting
this like it was you.

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:36.676 align:middle line:84%
The second chapter of "The
Reconnection," my book,

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.612 align:middle line:90%
is a retelling of this story.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.748 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
difficult chapter to write,

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
because I had to go
back and forth a lot,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.552 align:middle line:84%
spend a lot of time with my
mother on the phone trying

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:48.355 align:middle line:84%
to find words for things
that she said we don't

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:52.526 align:middle line:90%
really have the words here for.

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:55.762 align:middle line:84%
She understood how
there was a reason

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.898 align:middle line:84%
for everything and everything
makes perfect sense when

00:04:57.898 --> 00:04:59.599 align:middle line:90%
you're there.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.801 align:middle line:84%
But you're not supposed to
know it when you're here.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Her life was laid
out before her.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.638 align:middle line:90%
She knew it was a good life.

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:08.175 align:middle line:84%
Yet there was no judgment--
a seemingly contradictory

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:09.809 align:middle line:84%
concept, but that's
because we view

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
everything here linearly in
our four-dimensional existence.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.149 align:middle line:84%
And that's a more
multi-dimensional existence.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, the funny thing was,
for such a beautiful place--

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.723 align:middle line:84%
and she did say there was one
regret and only one regret

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:26.026 align:middle line:84%
that people who
leave the body have,

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:31.097 align:middle line:84%
that those who are left behind
mourn them because they don't

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:33.166 align:middle line:84%
realize what a
beautiful place it is,

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.634 align:middle line:84%
how really it's
all home, and how

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:38.071 align:middle line:84%
really almost instantaneously
we're there together.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.942 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly, she felt
herself being sent back.

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:44.311 align:middle line:84%
And for all the struggling
she did not to die, not

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.581 align:middle line:84%
to leave in the first place, now
she didn't want to leave there.

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:49.582 align:middle line:84%
But she felt herself
being sent back.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.718 align:middle line:84%
She was told she had
to raise her son.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.687 align:middle line:84%
And she felt all
of the insights she

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
was given being deprogrammed
from her, shall we say.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.558 align:middle line:90%
They were programmed to leave.

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:01.461 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed to have
those insights when we're here.

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.597 align:middle line:84%
And she struggled hard
to hold onto these,

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:05.832 align:middle line:84%
and some of the ones
she came back with.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting-- what
was interesting about this is--

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.805 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead.
Have some water.

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:17.244 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting about this
is, when she came out of this,

00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:21.314 align:middle line:84%
she no longer had a fear of
death that she had always had.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.383 align:middle line:90%
She no longer had it.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:27.988 align:middle line:84%
And once she explained it to
me, I no longer had it either.

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:30.156 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to being there.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.659 align:middle line:84%
Now, don't confuse
that with-- I don't

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:34.159 align:middle line:90%
plan to hurry up my life here.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.996 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ready to leave.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:37.197 align:middle line:90%
I have more things to do.

00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm sticking around for a while,
much to some people's dismay

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.302 align:middle line:90%
possibly.

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:45.705 align:middle line:84%
But I look very much forward
to that experience as well.

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:49.376 align:middle line:84%
So, you were raised by a
mother who had insights that

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:51.945 align:middle line:90%
were beyond normal insights.

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:55.215 align:middle line:84%
You were raised by someone who
introduced you to the world

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:90%
of healing very early on.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.056 align:middle line:84%
She had a larger
spiritual awareness.

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:06.593 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, the
things that we know,

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:12.799 align:middle line:84%
we don't always get
to be the message.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.335 align:middle line:84%
We can be the messenger
and not always the message.

00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:18.104 align:middle line:84%
For example, she learned how
ridiculous it was to judge

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.239 align:middle line:90%
people on their appearance.

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:23.109 align:middle line:84%
And she remembers waking
up in the hospital bed,

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.545 align:middle line:84%
after giving delivery
to me, looking over

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:29.549 align:middle line:84%
at the next bed and the woman in
it and going, boy, is she ugly.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:31.484 align:middle line:84%
And then she laughed to
herself, she said, now,

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
didn't I just learn
not to do that?

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.623 align:middle line:84%
Or not to be afraid of
little things such as germs.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.058 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same
time, she was always

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:42.829 align:middle line:84%
disinfecting and keeping my
milk bottle clear and aware

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:45.365 align:middle line:90%
of the contradictions in it.

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I have a message in the
teachings of this healing work.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.876 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I were the message.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:02.215 align:middle line:84%
I know most people out there
in this and related fields,

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.384 align:middle line:84%
many of them live
closer to their message.

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Many of them live further
from their message.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.925 align:middle line:84%
No one seems to fully be the
message, and I'm not either.

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:90%
I disappoint myself from it.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.696 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes berate
myself about it.

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:19.399 align:middle line:84%
I tell myself I won't make
the same mistakes again.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:22.268 align:middle line:84%
I tell myself I won't be
so hard on myself again.

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:25.972 align:middle line:84%
And yet then I do
the very same things.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:28.775 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
say to me, why do

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:29.976 align:middle line:84%
you think you were
chosen to bring

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:31.111 align:middle line:90%
through this level of healing?

00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:34.748 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, I certainly
wouldn't have picked me.

00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:36.216 align:middle line:90%
I know my past life.

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:37.984 align:middle line:90%
I know my present life.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:42.688 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the patience
that healers should have.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.191 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in the seminars when
someone asks a question I've

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.395 align:middle line:84%
answered three or four times,
I'll turn around and I say,

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:51.264 align:middle line:84%
I'll answer this again, but
really, weren't you listening?

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say to myself, I'm
not going to say that again.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.869 align:middle line:90%
And yet I do say it again.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:59.906 align:middle line:84%
So you're human and
proclaiming to be enlightened.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.876 align:middle line:84%
But you have a-- did
you have any experiences

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:05.478 align:middle line:84%
when you were a
child that you felt

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:07.247 align:middle line:84%
that you were a chosen one?
-No.

00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:09.215 align:middle line:84%
I don't gather
that you did, yes.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:09.916 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:12.786 align:middle line:84%
I had some fun experiences
that in looking back at

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:14.988 align:middle line:90%
them seem a little bit odd.

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:17.123 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem strong
enough at the time

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:18.858 align:middle line:90%
to signal anything to me.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:26.332 align:middle line:84%
But for example, my grandfather
just held onto his watches

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.033 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.968 align:middle line:84%
The watch would break, he'd
take it to the watchmaker.

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.004 align:middle line:84%
It would break again,
take it to the watchmaker.

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:32.906 align:middle line:84%
When the watchmaker
couldn't fix it again,

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.375 align:middle line:84%
he just for some reason
couldn't throw it away.

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:38.678 align:middle line:84%
So he had this box of old
watches that were broken.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:40.613 align:middle line:90%
One day he gave me the watches.

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:43.249 align:middle line:84%
I found that I could
hold the watches,

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.051 align:middle line:90%
and they would restart.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:48.021 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is just the
opposite of most people

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:51.357 align:middle line:84%
who are in a strange
biochemical balance.

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:53.893 align:middle line:84%
Most people either
wear watches fine

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.095 align:middle line:84%
or they break watches
by wearing them.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:57.163 align:middle line:90%
I could restart them.

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:59.432 align:middle line:84%
Would I say that that makes
me some special being?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
No, it just happened to be
some freak little event.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.941 align:middle line:84%
I had an interesting situation
happen when I was putting

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:09.375 align:middle line:84%
myself through
chiropractic school--

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:12.045 align:middle line:84%
or when my family was putting
me through chiropractor school

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:17.016 align:middle line:84%
and I was working on the
side as a shoe salesman.

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:20.954 align:middle line:84%
And someone came in
and was buying shoes,

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:25.024 align:middle line:84%
and they happened to work
at the place in Los Angeles

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.793 align:middle line:84%
seismology lab,
where they measure

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.295 align:middle line:90%
and anticipate for earthquakes.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said
to me, you know,

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
we're actually expecting a very
large earthquake on Wednesday.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.602 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you say anything to
anyone else here at the store?

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:84%
They said, no.
I said, well, do me a favor.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:37.971 align:middle line:90%
Don't.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.607 align:middle line:84%
And when they left, I said to
a couple of people, you know,

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I really think there's going to
be an earthquake-- to be funny.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.045 align:middle line:84%
And there was an earthquake that
came on Wednesday, so everyone

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.814 align:middle line:90%
was very excited about it.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.215 align:middle line:90%
And people would ask me again.

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:51.684 align:middle line:84%
And I found that there
were certain things that

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.786 align:middle line:84%
would trigger in
my awareness that I

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:55.154 align:middle line:84%
could say I believe
that there'll

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:57.724 align:middle line:90%
be an earthquake on this day.

00:10:57.724 --> 00:10:58.691 align:middle line:90%
And it came about.

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.628 align:middle line:84%
And it worked really well
for a couple of years,

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.396 align:middle line:84%
until someone got
angry at me and said,

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.664 align:middle line:90%
stop predicting gloom.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.999 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
felt nervous about it,

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.301 align:middle line:90%
and I stopped.

00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:11.271 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that this
is anyone's special gift.

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:15.575 align:middle line:84%
I think that what happens is we
really tune in to what science

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:17.744 align:middle line:90%
today calls zero point field.

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:19.746 align:middle line:84%
We tune into this
field of awareness.

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:21.548 align:middle line:90%
We're aware of it as kids.

00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:23.783 align:middle line:84%
School kids on a bus,
one child falls asleep,

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.752 align:middle line:84%
another child stares at
them until they wake up.

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:26.786 align:middle line:90%
We're in the field.

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:28.054 align:middle line:84%
You think about a
friend you haven't

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:29.289 align:middle line:90%
thought about for 15 years.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:31.958 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes later, the phone
rings, you're in the field.

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.593 align:middle line:84%
People who are
psychics, people who

00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:35.862 align:middle line:84%
are geniuses, people
who are healers--

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.263 align:middle line:90%
it's no special secret.

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.766 align:middle line:84%
They're just listening a
little more here, a little more

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
here, and not second guessing
the information that comes in.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.306 align:middle line:84%
When we judge ourselves,
we second guess.

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:51.477 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to observe without
judgment, we receive more.

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.146 align:middle line:90%
We participate more.

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:56.415 align:middle line:84%
We become more at one
with the universe.

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:58.985 align:middle line:84%
And the practice also
helps the more you do that,

00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:03.957 align:middle line:84%
the more you become trusting
of the veil being thinner.

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:05.825 align:middle line:90%
So what happened, though?

00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:08.394 align:middle line:84%
You had a pinnacle events
that came into your life

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:11.397 align:middle line:84%
as you were in practice
now, as a chiropractor.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:13.666 align:middle line:84%
You had a full,
thriving practice.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.369 align:middle line:84%
And what happened one day
when a friend of yours

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
took you to a psychic?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.377 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to this woman
on the beach reading cards.

00:12:24.377 --> 00:12:26.512 align:middle line:84%
She gave me a card reading,
nothing that stood out

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:28.147 align:middle line:84%
in my head as particularly--
-Just a random event.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:29.782 align:middle line:90%
You just went with a friend.

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.651 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:34.821 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said
to me, you know,

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:37.323 align:middle line:84%
there's this work that I do,
and you need to have it done.

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.292 align:middle line:90%
So I asked her to explain it.

00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, you
see the meridian lines that

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.663 align:middle line:84%
are on our bodies used to be
part of a much more powerful

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:45.264 align:middle line:90%
system than they are today.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:46.933 align:middle line:84%
They would extend
off of our bodies,

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.202 align:middle line:84%
tie into the grid lines
that encircle the planet,

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:51.671 align:middle line:84%
encircle the globe,
and then continue out,

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:54.173 align:middle line:84%
tying us into the rest of
the stars and the planets

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:57.644 align:middle line:84%
and the dimensions in between--
and that at a certain point

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:01.681 align:middle line:84%
in time, we, meaning
humanity, had

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:04.083 align:middle line:90%
become disconnected from this.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.753 align:middle line:84%
Some people would attribute
that time to the Garden of Eden.

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:10.289 align:middle line:84%
Different people, different
cultures have different time

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:12.358 align:middle line:84%
frames where they
recognize or feel

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
that we were all one
with the universe,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.163 align:middle line:84%
and then there became
a human separation.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:20.033 align:middle line:84%
And as the universe
continues to evolve

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
at its grand and wondrous
rate, we've been evolving.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.838 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, over
generations, we'll

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:29.075 align:middle line:84%
evolve to a point where we can
rejoin back into that system,

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:32.478 align:middle line:84%
but that she could do work
that would tie us back

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.747 align:middle line:84%
into it, sort of like
a giant, super-fast

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.617 align:middle line:90%
DSL hook-up, or something.

00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.385 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
this sounds intriguing.

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:40.853 align:middle line:84%
How much money do you
want for the work.

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:42.555 align:middle line:90%
And she said, $333.

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, thank you,
because I could think of lots

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.226 align:middle line:84%
of things to do with
$333, and giving

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:50.063 align:middle line:84%
them to a stranger on the beach
wasn't on the top of my list.

00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So I thanked her and
started to leave.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.333 align:middle line:84%
With the globe, with
the crystal ball.

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:58.104 align:middle line:84%
So I thanked her very much
and I started to leave.

00:13:58.104 --> 00:14:00.406 align:middle line:84%
And she scribbled something down
on a piece of paper and said,

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.141 align:middle line:84%
you can read about
it in a book called

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:06.112 align:middle line:84%
"The Book of Knowledge, the
Keys of Enoch," chapter 317.

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:08.448 align:middle line:90%
The author is Dr. JJ Hurtak.

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:09.449 align:middle line:90%
So I thanked her.

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:90%
I put the paper in my pocket.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.821 align:middle line:84%
I had no intention of paying
any attention to this again.

00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:16.989 align:middle line:84%
But I found I kept thinking
about it and thinking about it

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:17.924 align:middle line:90%
and thinking about it.

00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:21.828 align:middle line:84%
So finally I walked into what
used to be called the Bodhi

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:25.565 align:middle line:84%
Tree Bookstore in Los Angeles,
the big spiritual hub bookstore

00:14:25.565 --> 00:14:26.966 align:middle line:90%
there, at the time.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:30.236 align:middle line:84%
And I had an extra 10
minutes off from lunch.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:32.238 align:middle line:84%
So I took the book
down off the shelf.

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:34.507 align:middle line:84%
They had it locked
away in glass and key.

00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:36.976 align:middle line:84%
And I figured I'll skim
through this chapter 317.

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:38.511 align:middle line:90%
It's only eight little pages.

00:14:38.511 --> 00:14:39.612 align:middle line:90%
I'll quickly skim through it.

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever seen that book?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.048 align:middle line:84%
-No, I have not.
-OK.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.616 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell you
that there are just three

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.651 align:middle line:84%
things you cannot do with it.
-Skim?

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:46.953 align:middle line:84%
You cannot quickly
skim through it.

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:90%
You cannot read it.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.355 align:middle line:90%
And you cannot understand it.

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And outside of that,
it's a great book.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.426 align:middle line:84%
The more I read, the
more confused I became.

00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:56.129 align:middle line:84%
The more confused,
the more intrigued.

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:58.131 align:middle line:84%
I left the store,
I came back again.

00:14:58.131 --> 00:14:59.232 align:middle line:90%
I reread parts.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.767 align:middle line:84%
The parts I understood,
I didn't understand.

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:02.068 align:middle line:84%
Well, you kept being
drawn back to it.

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.504 align:middle line:84%
The parts I didn't
understand, I did understand.

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Finally, after going back
and forth and back and forth,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.208 align:middle line:84%
I decided maybe it
would just be cheaper

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:13.012 align:middle line:84%
if I paid the woman her $333
and let her do the work.

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:14.113 align:middle line:90%
So I called her up.

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:16.048 align:middle line:84%
She explained it was done
in two different days,

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:17.383 align:middle line:90%
two different sessions.

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:19.318 align:middle line:84%
I showed up on a
Thursday for part one.

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:21.654 align:middle line:84%
She placed me on
a massage table,

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:84%
dimmed the lights, put on the
new age tinkly music everyone's

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.459 align:middle line:84%
grown to know and
love for some reason.

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:28.494 align:middle line:84%
She started with
their fingertips

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:31.097 align:middle line:84%
tracing little line patterns
on my face and my body.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.965 align:middle line:84%
All the while I'm
lying there thinking,

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:36.235 align:middle line:84%
I cannot believe that this
woman is actually doing this

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:39.005 align:middle line:90%
and I paid her money to do it.

00:15:39.005 --> 00:15:40.973 align:middle line:84%
So sitting there in
a state of disbelief.

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And while lying there,
it suddenly dawned on me

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.113 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not going to
gain anything out of going

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.314 align:middle line:90%
on with my negative chatter.

00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:50.616 align:middle line:84%
So I might as well let
go and see what happens.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.285 align:middle line:84%
So with that, I let
myself drift off.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:55.288 align:middle line:84%
About another 45
minutes or so passes by.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:16:05.798 align:middle line:84%
She touches me gently, waking me
up with the grace and conscious

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:08.401 align:middle line:84%
of someone who feels
that the Earth had moved,

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:10.636 align:middle line:84%
except I seemed to be the
only one of the two of us

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.871 align:middle line:90%
who didn't notice.

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:13.239 align:middle line:90%
Get up slowly.

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:14.707 align:middle line:90%
Stay in your body.

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:15.708 align:middle line:90%
Keep your eyes closed.

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.109 align:middle line:84%
Take your feet,
feel for the ground.

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:19.579 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, isn't
it where I left it?

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
went on here, lady,

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.382 align:middle line:90%
but I clearly missed this point.

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.383 align:middle line:90%
I thanked her very much.

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:27.486 align:middle line:84%
I went home thinking there was
nothing more ridiculous I could

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.722 align:middle line:84%
possibly have done
except agreed to come

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:32.124 align:middle line:90%
back for part two on Sunday.

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:33.125 align:middle line:90%
I go home that night.

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything seems normal.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.561 align:middle line:90%
I go to sleep.

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:38.698 align:middle line:84%
About an hour
later, I'm awakened

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:41.634 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night
by a very, very bright light.

00:16:41.634 --> 00:16:43.469 align:middle line:84%
I opened my eyes
to see what it was,

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:47.707 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't anything seemingly
attributable to something

00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:48.841 align:middle line:90%
spiritual or metaphysical.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.743 align:middle line:84%
It was just the
lamp next to my bed.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.245 align:middle line:90%
It had turned itself on.

00:16:52.245 --> 00:16:53.946 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had that
lamp for 10 years.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.848 align:middle line:84%
It hadn't selected
any other propitious

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.083 align:middle line:90%
occasion to self-ignite.

00:16:57.083 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle line:84%
But I figured, maybe it was an
electrical short, except shorts

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:90%
usually turn things off.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.889 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there's
an electrical long.

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:07.526 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't think about it
that much, because what really

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:12.665 align:middle line:84%
took over my
awareness quite eerily

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:15.534 align:middle line:84%
was that it felt as if
somebody was in my house.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you what an
uncomfortable feeling it

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.173 align:middle line:84%
is to wake up and
feel that someone's

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:23.175 align:middle line:84%
in your home, when no one
was there an hour or so ago

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:23.943 align:middle line:90%
when you went to sleep.

00:17:23.943 --> 00:17:24.877 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, yes.

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:25.711 align:middle line:90%
You just freeze.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.146 align:middle line:90%
You're just frozen.

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:28.214 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.149 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize
you're not going

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:32.919 align:middle line:84%
to get anything out
of lying there frozen,

00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:34.153 align:middle line:84%
waiting to see
what might happen.

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:34.854 align:middle line:90%
Not breathing.

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:37.757 align:middle line:84%
So I got up very bravely
with, get this, a knife,

00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:39.959 align:middle line:84%
a can of pepper spray,
and my doberman pincher.

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.227 align:middle line:84%
And I went marching
through the house?

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.296 align:middle line:84%
You had all three of
those next to your bed?

00:17:43.296 --> 00:17:45.231 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.466 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I had
a knife under my bed.

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.769 align:middle line:84%
At that time, it
corresponded to when

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:52.939 align:middle line:84%
I had taken a class a
while back, when pepper

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:55.241 align:middle line:90%
spray classes were a big fad.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:57.443 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I had a
doberman pincher.

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:59.578 align:middle line:84%
So I went hunting
through the house.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:00.579 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't find anyone.

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:03.482 align:middle line:84%
And after about
20 minutes or so,

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:07.119 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
it was most likely

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:09.455 align:middle line:90%
my imagination, most likely.

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:10.856 align:middle line:90%
I got back into bed.

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:12.224 align:middle line:90%
I went to turn the lamp off.

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.793 align:middle line:84%
And you know that little
round button we click

00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:15.494 align:middle line:90%
on and click off in lamps?

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm a clicker, everything's
clicked into place.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.099 align:middle line:84%
Doors are shut,
toothpaste cap is on.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.701 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't clicked on.

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:23.402 align:middle line:90%
It was just rotated halfway.

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:25.871 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I
know that's not me.

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:28.074 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is, if they
let me wake up in the morning,

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:28.841 align:middle line:90%
they let me wake up.

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I might as well go to sleep or
I'll be a wreck for my patients

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.711 align:middle line:90%
the next day.

00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:33.813 align:middle line:84%
The next day I go in to
work, it's a normal day.

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:35.748 align:middle line:90%
Saturday's a normal Saturday.

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:37.917 align:middle line:84%
Sunday I come back
in for part two.

00:18:37.917 --> 00:18:38.918 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you went back.

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:39.785 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I paid her $333.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.756 align:middle line:84%
You're getting
your money's worth.

00:18:43.756 --> 00:18:44.957 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.659 align:middle line:90%
So I go back for part two.

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:50.129 align:middle line:84%
She lies me down on the table,
dims the lights, new age tinkly

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.064 align:middle line:84%
music again, starts
with the fingers

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.733 align:middle line:84%
and drawing the
lines on my body.

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.234 align:middle line:90%
But this time it's different.

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:56.736 align:middle line:90%
I can't seem to lie still.

00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:58.671 align:middle line:90%
My body is chilled.

00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:00.973 align:middle line:90%
It wants to move.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.875 align:middle line:84%
When she finished--
and mind you,

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:05.511 align:middle line:84%
this was an oppressively
hot, hot, hot August

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:07.947 align:middle line:84%
day in Southern California
in a non-air conditioned

00:19:07.947 --> 00:19:08.914 align:middle line:90%
one bedroom apartment.

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
When she finished,
I was so chilled

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.286 align:middle line:84%
she had to wrap me in a blanket
for a good five minutes.

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:16.689 align:middle line:84%
I remember leaving and
getting into my car,

00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:19.959 align:middle line:84%
I started the ignition,
began the drive.

00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:22.228 align:middle line:84%
I experienced a sense of
peace that on one hand

00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:24.563 align:middle line:84%
I had never known before,
and on the other hand,

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:27.166 align:middle line:84%
it was more familiar than
anything I'd ever experienced.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.036 align:middle line:84%
I started the drive home, and
I don't remember another thing.

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:31.904 align:middle line:90%
Don't recall a thing.

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:34.306 align:middle line:90%
Don't recall arriving at home.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.975 align:middle line:84%
Don't recall going
to sleep that night.

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:38.544 align:middle line:84%
Don't recall going in
to work the next day.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:42.982 align:middle line:84%
It was somewhere mid-morning,
my first recollection

00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:47.453 align:middle line:84%
is that I was standing in
a hallway in between some

00:19:47.453 --> 00:19:52.024 align:middle line:84%
of my chiropractic
adjustment rooms.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.427 align:middle line:84%
Two of my employees are
facing me, asking me

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:57.797 align:middle line:84%
what happened over the weekend,
why I looked so different,

00:19:57.797 --> 00:19:59.465 align:middle line:90%
why I sounded so different.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.634 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to say,
well, I paid some very charming

00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:04.603 align:middle line:84%
Jewish gypsy who called me
bubellah $333 to draw lines

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:05.638 align:middle line:90%
on my body with her fingertips.

00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:07.606 align:middle line:90%
Why do you ask?

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:09.842 align:middle line:90%
So I gave a non-response.

00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I went into the next room.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.878 align:middle line:90%
I worked on the patient.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.581 align:middle line:84%
I told the patient, as always,
to just close their eyes,

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:17.783 align:middle line:84%
relax for a minute or so
before they open their eyes

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:18.951 align:middle line:90%
and got up.

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:21.687 align:middle line:84%
When he opened his eyes, he said
to me, who walked into the room

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:23.422 align:middle line:84%
while I was lying here?
I said, no one.

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:24.323 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.891 align:middle line:84%
He said, no-- like
I didn't hear him.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.493 align:middle line:84%
Who walked into the room?
I said, no one.

00:20:27.493 --> 00:20:28.527 align:middle line:90%
He said, I heard them come in.

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:29.328 align:middle line:90%
I said, no one came in.

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.763 align:middle line:84%
He said, I heard them
standing at the door.

00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:31.530 align:middle line:90%
No one was at the door.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.466 align:middle line:84%
I went back and
forth, back and forth.

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:34.633 align:middle line:90%
Finally, he said OK.

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:37.403 align:middle line:84%
But I could tell he
didn't really believe me.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:39.305 align:middle line:90%
I didn't give it much thought.

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I went in to see
my next patient.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.842 align:middle line:84%
When I finished with
her, she opened her eyes.

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:45.244 align:middle line:84%
She said, who walked into the
room while I was lying there?

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.378 align:middle line:90%
I said, no one, why?

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:48.347 align:middle line:84%
She insisted the same story.
-Back and forth?

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:52.318 align:middle line:84%
All in all, seven
patients in this one day

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:54.854 align:middle line:84%
insisted that someone
came into the room,

00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:57.423 align:middle line:84%
stood there, walked around,
ran around, two of them

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:59.458 align:middle line:84%
actually looked at me and
said it felt as if flying.

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Someone was flying
around the ceiling.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.397 align:middle line:84%
Now, after 12 years in practice,
no one had ever said anything

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:06.665 align:middle line:90%
to me like this before.

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:08.701 align:middle line:84%
So seven people in one day,
you would think that this

00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:10.703 align:middle line:90%
would have gotten my attention.

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:12.571 align:middle line:84%
But other patients
are saying, I can feel

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:90%
your hands before you touch me.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.608 align:middle line:90%
Of course I didn't believe them.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.042 align:middle line:84%
I said, so lie down
and close your eyes.

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.644 align:middle line:90%
They had their eyes closed.

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:21.247 align:middle line:84%
I held my hands in different
directions, several feet

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:23.449 align:middle line:90%
to several yards away from them.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.718 align:middle line:84%
They could tell me, it
was aimed toward the feet,

00:21:25.718 --> 00:21:26.952 align:middle line:84%
it was aimed towards
their shoulders.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:29.822 align:middle line:84%
I would see tiny little muscles
in their forehead or chin

00:21:29.822 --> 00:21:31.557 align:middle line:84%
ripple the way you drop
a pebble into water.

00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:33.225 align:middle line:90%
And it begins to ripple.

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:36.795 align:middle line:84%
Involuntary muscles, muscles
we couldn't move by intention.

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:39.031 align:middle line:84%
I would see their eyes
rapidly dart back and forth

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.533 align:middle line:90%
when they'd open their eyes.

00:21:40.533 --> 00:21:42.001 align:middle line:84%
They would tell me
they were seeing colors

00:21:42.001 --> 00:21:44.003 align:middle line:84%
they had never before
seen, smelling flowers

00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:45.571 align:middle line:90%
they had never smelled before.

00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And they started
reporting healings.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.974 align:middle line:90%
Real healings.

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:50.976 align:middle line:84%
They were getting up out
of wheelchairs, vision

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.912 align:middle line:84%
and hearing returning,
children with cerebral palsy

00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:54.547 align:middle line:84%
and epilepsy--
-Oh, my goodness.

00:21:54.547 --> 00:21:57.383 align:middle line:84%
--were able to walk around
and play, not have seizures,

00:21:57.383 --> 00:21:59.485 align:middle line:84%
not need their medications,
their parents would call,

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:00.352 align:middle line:90%
their doctors would call.

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:01.687 align:middle line:90%
They'd say, what did you do?

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:03.889 align:middle line:84%
I said, I didn't do anything,
and don't tell anyone.

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:04.757 align:middle line:90%
Which went over about as--

00:22:04.757 --> 00:22:06.091 align:middle line:90%
Were you afraid of your gifts?

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:07.159 align:middle line:90%
I mean, were you afraid of this?

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:07.993 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:08.694 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:21.073 align:middle line:84%
I may have been-- I don't
know what the word is.

00:22:21.073 --> 00:22:25.544 align:middle line:84%
I was in awe of
something large, but I

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:30.549 align:middle line:84%
don't know that I was
quite ready yet for people

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:31.584 align:middle line:90%
to start talking about it.

00:22:31.584 --> 00:22:33.152 align:middle line:84%
To wrap your head around
it and to tell people

00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:33.852 align:middle line:90%
you were doing this.

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:35.721 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying
to discover it.

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:39.491 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to lose
credibility with doctors

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:40.993 align:middle line:90%
and other professionals.

00:22:40.993 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:90%
A thriving practice.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.795 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:46.198 align:middle line:84%
And soon people started
asking me to teach this.

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.334 align:middle line:84%
And I said, teach it?
You've got to be nuts.

00:22:48.334 --> 00:22:49.868 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing there waving
my hands in the air,

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:50.669 align:middle line:90%
looking like a fool.

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:53.105 align:middle line:84%
So you go outside, wave
your hands in the air,

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
let me know what your
neighbors have to say about it.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.941 align:middle line:84%
See what they have to say.
Yes.

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.743 align:middle line:84%
But more and more, my
patients would tell me,

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:59.511 align:middle line:84%
I drove home after
my session with you.

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:00.679 align:middle line:84%
I pulled up in
front of my house,

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:03.148 align:middle line:84%
the automatic garage door
opened before I hit the button.

00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:06.085 align:middle line:84%
Or I walked inside, the lamp
or the TV turned off and on.

00:23:06.085 --> 00:23:07.086 align:middle line:90%
I felt sensations in my hands.

00:23:07.086 --> 00:23:09.588 align:middle line:84%
So the energy was
transferring to the patient

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:11.523 align:middle line:84%
where they were
actually-- interesting.

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:14.293 align:middle line:84%
Transmitting to them,
they held their hands

00:23:14.293 --> 00:23:15.361 align:middle line:90%
by someone in their family.

00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:16.862 align:middle line:84%
The father could walk
after the stroke.

00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:19.932 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever go back
and try to find the lady

00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:23.302 align:middle line:90%
that did the healing on you?

00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:26.372 align:middle line:84%
I was having
strange experiences.

00:23:26.372 --> 00:23:29.675 align:middle line:84%
The lamps were turning
on about twice a week.

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:33.312 align:middle line:84%
There was a door open somewhere,
interior door of my home,

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:34.713 align:middle line:90%
about twice a week.

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:39.451 align:middle line:84%
If I slept at someone else's
home, it would happen there.

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:42.121 align:middle line:84%
I would call her up and
say what was going on.

00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:43.856 align:middle line:84%
She'd give me new
age platitudes,

00:23:43.856 --> 00:23:45.524 align:middle line:84%
but she couldn't really
come up with answers.

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:49.862 align:middle line:84%
But you see, the story
didn't yet become strange.

00:23:49.862 --> 00:23:52.631 align:middle line:84%
Did anything that she--
did she say that this was

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:54.933 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary
experience for her,

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:58.003 align:middle line:84%
that this was unlike any
other healing she had done?

00:23:58.003 --> 00:23:58.804 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:04.576 align:middle line:84%
But then as I started to
work with the patients-- see,

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.178 align:middle line:84%
I haven't told this
story for so long

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
that I'm trying to remember
it now so some of it

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:08.947 align:middle line:90%
may be out of sequence.

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:09.815 align:middle line:90%
You're doing a great job.

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:10.816 align:middle line:90%
I'm involved.

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:12.484 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:16.288 align:middle line:84%
As I started doing the
healings with patients,

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:19.224 align:middle line:84%
on more than one occasion,
my palm blistered.

00:24:19.224 --> 00:24:21.493 align:middle line:84%
Tiny little millimeter
sized blisters.

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.996 align:middle line:84%
Not full sized ones,
millimeter sized blisters.

00:24:23.996 --> 00:24:27.032 align:middle line:84%
Instead of lasting--
what do blisters last,

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:28.967 align:middle line:90%
a few days usually at least?

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:31.537 align:middle line:84%
These were gone
inside a few hours.

00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:35.074 align:middle line:84%
On another occasion, my palm
bled, not like a stigmata

00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:35.808 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:38.677 align:middle line:84%
This didn't scare you,
in any way frighten you,

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:40.346 align:middle line:84%
make you think--
-No.

00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:41.714 align:middle line:84%
This was just a
little bit of blood,

00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:43.849 align:middle line:84%
like if you stick your
palm with a needle.

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.687 align:middle line:90%
It excited me.

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:52.057 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was standing in
the presence of something

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
so huge it couldn't
be interpreted.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.796 align:middle line:90%
I was more in a state of awe.

00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:59.331 align:middle line:84%
That's the closest
word I can tell you.

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:02.134 align:middle line:84%
Now, awe can be
confused with fear.

00:25:02.134 --> 00:25:03.502 align:middle line:90%
But it was reverence.

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:04.937 align:middle line:90%
But it was reverence.

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:08.374 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like, if you
listen to some interpretations

00:25:08.374 --> 00:25:11.009 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible, they talk
about being God fearing.

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.945 align:middle line:84%
And that phrase never
made sense to me.

00:25:12.945 --> 00:25:16.515 align:middle line:84%
Why would a god want
us to be in fear?

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:19.351 align:middle line:84%
And in looking back at
the original Hebrew,

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:90%
it's a mistranslation.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:84%
The word that it was
taken from, [HEBREW],

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.559 align:middle line:84%
on its most base
level could mean fear.

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:30.696 align:middle line:84%
But on its highest level,
it means to be in awe.

00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:34.867 align:middle line:84%
It's someone who is in awe of
God, in awe of that presence.

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:38.637 align:middle line:90%
And so then it got stranger.

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:40.139 align:middle line:90%
Like this isn't strange enough.

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:41.673 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:44.777 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened was,
about four months into it,

00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:47.513 align:middle line:84%
I had a patient
come in to see me.

00:25:47.513 --> 00:25:50.082 align:middle line:84%
Now, this patient was a patient
of mine from a while back

00:25:50.082 --> 00:25:52.851 align:middle line:84%
but had been out of town
so wasn't coming in when

00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:54.119 align:middle line:90%
the healings were happening.

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:56.288 align:middle line:84%
He showed up to
receive chiropractic.

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:58.757 align:middle line:84%
I gave him his
chiropractic visits.

00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:01.193 align:middle line:84%
And then I told him, as I
always tell my patients,

00:26:01.193 --> 00:26:03.429 align:middle line:84%
just lie there with your
eyes closed for a moment.

00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
But what I started doing was
sort of feeling the field,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.402 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, around them
while they were lying

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:90%
there with their eyes closed.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.973 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that,
his head jerked back,

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:16.542 align:middle line:84%
his eyes rolled to
the top of his head,

00:26:16.542 --> 00:26:18.677 align:middle line:84%
his mouth opened, his
tongue started to move,

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:21.413 align:middle line:84%
his arms were sort
of gently swaying.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:25.284 align:middle line:84%
And air audibly
escaped his mouth.

00:26:25.284 --> 00:26:26.852 align:middle line:84%
You could see from
the way his tongue was

00:26:26.852 --> 00:26:29.121 align:middle line:84%
moving that he was speaking, but
you couldn't really hear words.

00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:32.324 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I brought
my ear close to listen.

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:33.959 align:middle line:84%
And I did hear a
voice-- which I used

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:36.462 align:middle line:84%
to say it's the voice of our
mothers we all carry with us.

00:26:36.462 --> 00:26:37.362 align:middle line:90%
I've changed my mind.

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:40.499 align:middle line:84%
It's the voice of my mother
we all carry with us-- saying,

00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:41.233 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing?

00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:43.168 align:middle line:84%
Get your ear away from
that crazy person.

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.736 align:middle line:90%
He might bite you.

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:46.104 align:middle line:84%
So I can't explain
what it's like to be

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:48.073 align:middle line:84%
struck funny and freaked
out at the same time.

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:49.675 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I realized
all the patients

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:50.509 align:middle line:90%
were waiting to come in.

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:51.643 align:middle line:90%
I had to stop.

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:54.413 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of touched him
lightly and I let him stop.

00:26:54.413 --> 00:26:56.081 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't say
anything to me,

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:57.349 align:middle line:90%
so I didn't say anything to him.

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.383 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what am I going to say?

00:26:58.383 --> 00:26:59.318 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Fred, what's this?

00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:02.054 align:middle line:84%
You just start
speaking in tongue.

00:27:02.054 --> 00:27:03.956 align:middle line:90%
So he left.

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:05.657 align:middle line:84%
But when he came back
on his next visit,

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:06.825 align:middle line:90%
the same thing happened.

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:08.694 align:middle line:84%
Now realize, he was a patient
of mine for a long time,

00:27:08.694 --> 00:27:10.162 align:middle line:90%
never did this before.

00:27:10.162 --> 00:27:11.497 align:middle line:84%
On his second visit,
the same thing

00:27:11.497 --> 00:27:15.033 align:middle line:84%
happened, but this time the air
condensed itself into a voice.

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:18.003 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said, we are
here to tell you to continue

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:19.671 align:middle line:90%
doing what you are doing.

00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:22.875 align:middle line:84%
What you are doing is
bringing light and information

00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:23.742 align:middle line:90%
onto the planet.

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you heard this voice, you
knew to step back and listen.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.615 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:30.682 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:27:30.682 --> 00:27:32.251 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in
quite a bit of shock.

00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:35.387 align:middle line:84%
I finally-- my patients were
in my other rooms, again,

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:37.789 align:middle line:84%
waiting for me.
So I touched him lightly.

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:40.125 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Fred--
and this time,

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:42.694 align:middle line:84%
he jumped up off of the table,
backed against the wall,

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:46.798 align:middle line:84%
extended his arms out
blocking the wall phone,

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:48.867 align:middle line:84%
because he was afraid I was
going to call a mental hospital

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:50.235 align:middle line:90%
and have him taken away.

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.004 align:middle line:84%
So he explained to
me that this voice

00:27:52.004 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:84%
had come through him a few times
since he was a young child.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.675 align:middle line:84%
Only two people in his
life knew about it.

00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:57.976 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want anyone to know.

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:59.344 align:middle line:84%
He felt it starting
on the last visit

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.013 align:middle line:84%
but thought I didn't
notice anything.

00:28:01.013 --> 00:28:02.381 align:middle line:90%
And this time it got away.

00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:03.248 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, all right.

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.484 align:middle line:90%
It's something unique to Fred.

00:28:05.484 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:90%
That's all I attributed it to.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.656 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, three other
patients heads jerked,

00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:13.325 align:middle line:84%
eyes rolled, mouth open,
tongue moved, air came out.

00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:15.661 align:middle line:84%
I was not going to wait
for a double blind story

00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:18.463 align:middle line:84%
on their second--
and I know the show's

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:20.799 align:middle line:84%
only so long, so I'm going to
skip the details around this.

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:21.667 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating story.

00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:25.504 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say that
on their second visit,

00:28:25.504 --> 00:28:26.805 align:middle line:90%
they lost consciousness.

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:29.274 align:middle line:84%
They spoke the same
two phrases Fred said.

00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:30.576 align:middle line:84%
We're here to tell
you to continue

00:28:30.576 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:90%
doing what you're doing.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.779 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is bringing
light and information

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:34.479 align:middle line:90%
onto the planet.

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:35.914 align:middle line:84%
Then two of them added
what you're doing

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:37.349 align:middle line:90%
is reconnecting strands.

00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:40.185 align:middle line:84%
One of them said, what you're
doing is reconnecting strings.

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:41.587 align:middle line:84%
Fred came back in
later that week

00:28:41.587 --> 00:28:45.891 align:middle line:84%
and said, what you're doing
is reconnecting strings.

00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
A few days later, five
other patients, all in all,

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.164 align:middle line:84%
there was a three-month period
of time where over 50, 5-0,

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:54.433 align:middle line:84%
different patients
lost consciousness,

00:28:54.433 --> 00:29:00.305 align:middle line:84%
brought through six word
for word verbatim phrases.

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:03.075 align:middle line:84%
And then it stopped
coming through everyone,

00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:06.044 align:middle line:84%
but it continued
coming through Fred.

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Fred didn't like to talk
about this a whole lot,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.415 align:middle line:84%
but I could once in a
while coerce him to do it,

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:90%
and I made recordings of those.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.552 align:middle line:84%
-Oh, you did?
-Yeah.

00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:14.953 align:middle line:84%
I thought enough--
I transcribed them.

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:16.722 align:middle line:90%
Wait, I'll just finish this.

00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I transcribed them.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.424 align:middle line:90%
I transcribed them.

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:23.128 align:middle line:84%
Fred and I lost contact and
regained contact over the years

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:24.763 align:middle line:90%
off and on.

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:29.601 align:middle line:84%
And we finally decided to
put it together into a book,

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:31.536 align:middle line:84%
and Hay House is planning
on releasing the book

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:32.771 align:middle line:90%
in February of this year.

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.607 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's still to be-- the
story is still to be put out.

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:36.274 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.943 align:middle line:84%
Well, that actually
is a great place

00:29:37.943 --> 00:29:40.278 align:middle line:84%
to take a quick
break, because I want

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.314 align:middle line:84%
to learn about
what the energy is

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:44.282 align:middle line:84%
and what you've
experienced since then

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:46.785 align:middle line:84%
and how you've learned
that this is now

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:90%
to be scientifically validated.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.455 align:middle line:90%
It's been an incredible journey.

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:53.692 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be right back
to talk with Eric Pearl

00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:56.128 align:middle line:84%
about his journey,
his healing journey,

00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:58.764 align:middle line:84%
and then learn a little bit
more about Reconnective Healing.

00:29:58.764 --> 00:30:00.499 align:middle line:84%
We'll be right back.
This is Lisa Garr.

00:30:00.499 --> 00:30:02.701 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:30:04.069 --> 00:30:10.542 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC]

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.789 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:90%
This is Lisa Garr.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.325 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here on the edge of my
seat basically with this story

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:30.095 align:middle line:84%
that Eric Pearl is talking
about in terms of his journey,

00:30:30.095 --> 00:30:31.129 align:middle line:90%
his healing journey.

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.831 align:middle line:84%
It's so great, really,
for you to be telling

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:35.901 align:middle line:84%
the story for anyone who's
listening who might have had

00:30:35.901 --> 00:30:39.571 align:middle line:84%
these experiences and
really has never voiced them

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:42.674 align:middle line:84%
and have been terrified or even
shoved down or forgotten them.

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.443 align:middle line:84%
It's great for you to
be telling this story.

00:30:44.443 --> 00:30:47.112 align:middle line:84%
I haven't told this
story for years.

00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:48.146 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't know that.

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:50.482 align:middle line:84%
Basically because I would
tell a lot of the story

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:51.950 align:middle line:90%
at the seminars for a while.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But as the book,
"The Reconnection,"

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.255 align:middle line:84%
was so well read, so
many people would say,

00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:59.691 align:middle line:84%
well, we already know
a lot of that story.

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:02.828 align:middle line:84%
So I would skip it and I
would go into other things.

00:31:02.828 --> 00:31:06.031 align:middle line:84%
It is well documented in
the book, "The Reconnection."

00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:08.366 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this energy started
coming through your hands.

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:14.039 align:middle line:84%
And you experienced these people
speaking through them to you,

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:15.607 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
these messages.

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:19.978 align:middle line:84%
And how did you eventually
determine what the energy is.

00:31:19.978 --> 00:31:22.147 align:middle line:90%
How did you learn what it does?

00:31:22.147 --> 00:31:25.117 align:middle line:90%
How did you hone the skills?

00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:26.451 align:middle line:90%
And what did the lady say?

00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:28.453 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about that.

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:29.755 align:middle line:90%
What did the lady say?

00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:32.557 align:middle line:84%
The psychic, when
you said that that--

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.025 align:middle line:90%
I would call her periodically.

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:39.297 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, twice a week,
the lamps are turning on.

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:42.467 align:middle line:84%
And there's a door
somewhere in my home

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:44.302 align:middle line:84%
that I've closed--
never the same door,

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:45.937 align:middle line:90%
but I always close these doors.

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:47.639 align:middle line:84%
And another door would
open, and it happens

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:48.774 align:middle line:90%
in other people's houses.

00:31:48.774 --> 00:31:51.343 align:middle line:84%
And I explained the
blistering and the bleeding.

00:31:51.343 --> 00:31:55.814 align:middle line:84%
And her new age
platitudes would get

00:31:55.814 --> 00:31:57.749 align:middle line:90%
further and further stretched.

00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:00.218 align:middle line:84%
She was having
trouble responding.

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:03.522 align:middle line:10%
By the time I told her about
the blistering and the bleeding

00:32:03.522 --> 00:32:05.757 align:middle line:10%
and the voices coming
through, she went,

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:07.659 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what
to say about that.

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:10%
Let me introduce you to the
woman who taught me this work.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.565 align:middle line:10%
And we can explain it there.

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:16.668 align:middle line:10%
So I had a conversation with
her and with the other woman

00:32:16.668 --> 00:32:17.769 align:middle line:10%
and some other things.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:23.642 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, what it
pretty much came down to is

00:32:23.642 --> 00:32:26.144 align:middle line:84%
that you could say that
the woman who originated

00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:32.017 align:middle line:84%
the work that this woman on the
beach did for me created a key.

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:34.252 align:middle line:84%
Let's just use an
analogy of a key.

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:35.453 align:middle line:90%
She created a key.

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:37.088 align:middle line:84%
Everyone she taught
how to do the work,

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:38.657 align:middle line:84%
she taught them to do
it exactly the same,

00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:40.826 align:middle line:84%
so she gave them all
duplicates of this key.

00:32:40.826 --> 00:32:42.727 align:middle line:90%
She said, keep trying locks.

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:43.762 align:middle line:90%
Keep trying doors.

00:32:43.762 --> 00:32:45.997 align:middle line:84%
Eventually this
will unlock a lock.

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:48.967 align:middle line:90%
It'll open a door.

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.669 align:middle line:90%
I was the door that the key fit.

00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:53.738 align:middle line:84%
It seems that nobody
had had this response

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:56.308 align:middle line:84%
before or after me.
It was just me.

00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:58.009 align:middle line:84%
I was the door
that this key fit.

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:01.279 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the gift, and we
need to bear that in mind.

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:02.614 align:middle line:90%
I'm the door.

00:33:02.614 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:84%
If Oprah Winfrey walks
in this door right here,

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.585 align:middle line:84%
no one's going to run
over to the door and go,

00:33:06.585 --> 00:33:09.020 align:middle line:90%
wow, what a great door.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:09.721 align:middle line:90%
It's the gift.

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:12.591 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the
woman who did this work to me

00:33:12.591 --> 00:33:14.893 align:middle line:84%
came back to me to
receive the gift.

00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:18.997 align:middle line:84%
In other words, she had the
key that unlocked the door

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:20.899 align:middle line:90%
through which the gift came.

00:33:20.899 --> 00:33:23.001 align:middle line:84%
But she came to
receive the gift.

00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So would you say
that this key unlocks

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.607 align:middle line:84%
various dimensions of energy,
of portals, would you say?

00:33:28.607 --> 00:33:29.574 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.876 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:30.876 --> 00:33:36.748 align:middle line:84%
It takes us from a
four-dimensional existence

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:38.516 align:middle line:84%
into a multi-dimensional
existence.

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people
would like to think

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.289 align:middle line:84%
of the multi-dimensional
existence

00:33:44.289 --> 00:33:47.659 align:middle line:84%
as the next level of
existence, next meaning

00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:49.294 align:middle line:90%
going from four to five.

00:33:49.294 --> 00:33:52.731 align:middle line:84%
But it's really a misnomer
to call it fifth dimensional,

00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:55.166 align:middle line:84%
because once you step
beyond four dimensions,

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:58.470 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer linear,
so it cannot be five.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.073 align:middle line:84%
Once you hear someone talking
about sixth-dimensional or

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:04.209 align:middle line:84%
26th-dimensional healing
or something like that,

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:05.677 align:middle line:84%
the one thing you
can be assured of

00:34:05.677 --> 00:34:08.346 align:middle line:84%
is that they have no idea
what they're talking about.

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:11.882 align:middle line:84%
Because once you step
into this space--

00:34:11.882 --> 00:34:12.784 align:middle line:90%
Time and space disappears.

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:14.052 align:middle line:90%
Time is simultaneous.

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:16.454 align:middle line:90%
Right, it disappears.

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:20.525 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at this
from a limited four-dimensional

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:84%
existence, then your
natural question

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.429 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, I wonder
what might come next

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.531 align:middle line:90%
after Reconnective Healing.

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:29.434 align:middle line:84%
But if you step into the
multi-dimensional comprehension

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:32.804 align:middle line:84%
of this, you realize that
that question is sort

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.438 align:middle line:90%
of inappropriate or inaccurate.

00:34:34.438 --> 00:34:36.174 align:middle line:84%
There isn't something
that comes next.

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:37.641 align:middle line:84%
-It's endless.
-Its endless.

00:34:37.641 --> 00:34:40.078 align:middle line:84%
Everything becomes
a simultaneous,

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:42.781 align:middle line:90%
continuous expansion.

00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:84%
And it's teaching us how to
expand who and what we are.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.288 align:middle line:84%
So I can understand
that you would go on

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:53.725 align:middle line:84%
to continue to heal
people and have them

00:34:53.725 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:90%
have incredible experiences.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.763 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the Western
mind needs to scientifically

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.598 align:middle line:90%
validate what's happening here.

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:02.167 align:middle line:90%
And that has been done on you.

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:04.502 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate the fact
that it has been done on you,

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:07.939 align:middle line:84%
because it helps people
understand or maybe

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.641 align:middle line:84%
look at this from a
linear perspective,

00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:11.176 align:middle line:90%
because that's what we do.

00:35:11.176 --> 00:35:15.313 align:middle line:84%
And although we know and
experience and feel and heel,

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:18.917 align:middle line:84%
the linear mind sometimes wants
to grasp what this healing is.

00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:22.988 align:middle line:84%
And I am wide open,
and always have been,

00:35:22.988 --> 00:35:26.858 align:middle line:84%
to any legitimate
researchers who

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:29.894 align:middle line:90%
want to do study on this work.

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:30.962 align:middle line:90%
And there has been.

00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:33.431 align:middle line:84%
And there has been a lot
from around the world.

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:36.001 align:middle line:84%
Now, the one thing
I'll say to you

00:35:36.001 --> 00:35:38.470 align:middle line:84%
is the one thing I say
to anyone, including

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.739 align:middle line:84%
the researchers who don't
really like me saying this,

00:35:40.739 --> 00:35:47.779 align:middle line:84%
but I can't help it, because
this is my reality on this.

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:50.315 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that the
most important thing about

00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:53.585 align:middle line:90%
the research is what they find.

00:35:53.585 --> 00:35:57.989 align:middle line:84%
I believe the most important
thing about the research

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.458 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that the
research is being done.

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:04.963 align:middle line:84%
It's the very fact that
the research is being done

00:36:04.963 --> 00:36:09.701 align:middle line:84%
that allows a lot of the general
public to remove their blinders

00:36:09.701 --> 00:36:11.836 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, if science
is looking at this,

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:12.937 align:middle line:90%
then I will look at it.

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:13.638 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:14.939 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:18.076 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- for
instance, on the book cover,

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:90%
it says Dr. Eric Pearl.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:20.779 align:middle line:84%
Do you think for one
moment being a doctor

00:36:20.779 --> 00:36:22.213 align:middle line:90%
has anything to do with this?

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:24.449 align:middle line:90%
Nothing whatsoever.

00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:27.352 align:middle line:84%
I even said to Hay House,
there's no reason for "Doctor"

00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:29.154 align:middle line:84%
to be on the cover,
but you know,

00:36:29.154 --> 00:36:31.956 align:middle line:84%
contractually they get to put
on the cover what they want.

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:34.993 align:middle line:84%
And I do realize that
there is a reason that it's

00:36:34.993 --> 00:36:36.428 align:middle line:84%
all right for "Doctor"
to be on a cover,

00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:39.097 align:middle line:84%
because it allows
people to pick up a book

00:36:39.097 --> 00:36:41.833 align:middle line:84%
that otherwise they
might have stepped over.

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:43.735 align:middle line:84%
But for some
reason, we attribute

00:36:43.735 --> 00:36:46.838 align:middle line:84%
that if a doctor is involved
in it, it must be more.

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:48.173 align:middle line:84%
Well, we also get
the opportunity

00:36:48.173 --> 00:36:50.108 align:middle line:84%
to look at some of the
scientific research that's been

00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:51.843 align:middle line:90%
done by Konstantin Korotkov.

00:36:51.843 --> 00:36:52.811 align:middle line:90%
I believe he did some of the--

00:36:52.811 --> 00:36:54.379 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the
many researchers.

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:58.883 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
Dr. Korotkov is a very,

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:01.453 align:middle line:90%
very significant researcher.

00:37:01.453 --> 00:37:05.990 align:middle line:84%
He's at the main university
in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.459 align:middle line:90%
He works with the government.

00:37:07.459 --> 00:37:11.429 align:middle line:90%
He works with the Olympic teams.

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:15.033 align:middle line:84%
One of the more recent studies
that we did with Dr. Korotkov

00:37:15.033 --> 00:37:18.136 align:middle line:84%
was-- now, I hope I can
tell this accurately.

00:37:18.136 --> 00:37:19.804 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a little
off, I apologize.

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:21.906 align:middle line:84%
We have some slides
of it as well.

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:22.907 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure.

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:24.375 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look at one of them.

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain
what's happening.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.545 align:middle line:84%
You want me to explain it
while the slides are on?

00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:28.279 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:29.114 align:middle line:90%
If I recognize it.

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:31.049 align:middle line:90%
What acts really was done?

00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:33.118 align:middle line:90%
And this is your hand?

00:37:33.118 --> 00:37:34.986 align:middle line:90%
No, this is not my hand.

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.988 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
to understand,

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:38.356 align:middle line:90%
that it's not my hand.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:43.561 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, the gift of
this work is not about me.

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.631 align:middle line:84%
The gift of this work is
that each and every one of us

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:47.866 align:middle line:90%
can learn to do this.

00:37:47.866 --> 00:37:50.401 align:middle line:84%
So when we do research
studies, yes, I

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:52.036 align:middle line:90%
like to be involved in it.

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:55.006 align:middle line:84%
But I like to bring other
people who have learned

00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:56.341 align:middle line:90%
the work to be involved in it.

00:37:56.341 --> 00:38:00.879 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the ways
that they measure the energy.

00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:04.015 align:middle line:84%
This is called Laser-Doppler
Profusion Imager.

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:07.051 align:middle line:84%
It evaluates blood flow
and blood flow changes.

00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:10.421 align:middle line:84%
There's also
Kirlian photography,

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:13.191 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Korotkov is
known for what I believe

00:38:13.191 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is called the EPC unit, which
is the highest level in science

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.865 align:middle line:84%
today, the evolution
of Kirlian photography,

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:26.237 align:middle line:84%
which is virtually the main
accepted measurement that's

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:29.407 align:middle line:84%
in pretty much every
laboratory around the world

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:34.679 align:middle line:84%
studying this work,
and his EBC work.

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:37.982 align:middle line:84%
What we did in this
most recent study,

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.919 align:middle line:84%
about a year ago, was we
took 60-- I believe it was

00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:43.521 align:middle line:90%
60-- Russian Olympic athletes.

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.757 align:middle line:84%
And I think I worked
with 20 of them.

00:38:45.757 --> 00:38:48.593 align:middle line:84%
20 of them was a control
group that received nothing,

00:38:48.593 --> 00:38:50.028 align:middle line:84%
and 20 of them was
a control group

00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:51.963 align:middle line:84%
that received energy
healing, because Reconnective

00:38:51.963 --> 00:38:53.498 align:middle line:90%
Healing is not energy healing.

00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:56.467 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to evolve
beyond energy healing,

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:84%
access the energy
and move beyond it.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.873 align:middle line:84%
He measured all three
groups 10 days later.

00:39:01.873 --> 00:39:04.008 align:middle line:84%
The reason he waited 10
days to do the evaluation

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:84%
was because he
wanted to make sure

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.478 align:middle line:84%
that any changes
were not transient,

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:09.047 align:middle line:84%
but that they were
lasting changes.

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:14.319 align:middle line:84%
Only the group with
Reconnective Healing

00:39:14.319 --> 00:39:19.824 align:middle line:84%
received 100% changes and
improvements in their red blood

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:23.094 align:middle line:84%
cells, their white blood cells,
their blood humeral levels,

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.029 align:middle line:84%
their emotional
states-- and get this,

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:27.899 align:middle line:90%
he told me their DNA changes.

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:29.767 align:middle line:90%
This was the fifth study.

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.803 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's a sixth
international study being

00:39:31.803 --> 00:39:34.639 align:middle line:84%
planned that shows that
Reconnective Healing so far is

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:36.941 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that's been
discovered, I believe,

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:42.680 align:middle line:84%
that alters or affects the DNA,
both plant DNA and human DNA.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.582 align:middle line:84%
They did plant
evaluations, where

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:46.551 align:middle line:90%
they cut leaves off of plants.

00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:48.553 align:middle line:84%
If you cut the leaf
off, the leaf by itself

00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:50.421 align:middle line:90%
would live seven to 10 days.

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:54.492 align:middle line:84%
They did some studies of
prayer and intention and energy

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:57.762 align:middle line:84%
healing, were able to
get the leaves to live

00:39:57.762 --> 00:39:59.297 align:middle line:90%
quite noticeably longer.

00:39:59.297 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But with Reconnective
Healing, they

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.272 align:middle line:84%
were able to get the leaves to
live from between 70 to 90 days

00:40:07.272 --> 00:40:10.074 align:middle line:84%
without its attached
life source.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.709 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.011 align:middle line:90%
Totally unheard of.

00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:15.113 align:middle line:84%
Why do you call
it reconnective?

00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:18.082 align:middle line:90%
What are we reconnecting to?

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:21.519 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I told you--
well, it starts this way.

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:23.321 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to give it a name.

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:25.156 align:middle line:84%
I did not want to
give it a name,

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:26.858 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that
when we name something,

00:40:26.858 --> 00:40:28.893 align:middle line:84%
we say, this is what
it is, and everything

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:30.261 align:middle line:90%
else is what it isn't.

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And if there are two things
I knew we didn't know-- A,

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.399 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know what it
was, and we definitely

00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:35.633 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what it wasn't.

00:40:35.633 --> 00:40:37.769 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't going
to give it a name.

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:41.339 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, human
nature couldn't stand that.

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:44.509 align:middle line:84%
So in the Northeast, they were
calling it Eric Pearl Healing.

00:40:44.509 --> 00:40:47.278 align:middle line:84%
In the Southeast, it was
Pearl High Frequency Healing.

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:49.514 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere else-- it
always had my name,

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:51.015 align:middle line:84%
and it always had
something that had

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:55.386 align:middle line:84%
to be high or big or better--
you know, the linear phrasing.

00:40:55.386 --> 00:40:57.221 align:middle line:84%
And so finally,
I'm thinking, I've

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.089 align:middle line:90%
got to come up with a name.

00:40:58.089 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:90%
I've got to come up with a name.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.527 align:middle line:84%
And I'm coming up with all these
interesting words and things,

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:03.628 align:middle line:90%
and creating acronyms.

00:41:03.628 --> 00:41:05.029 align:middle line:84%
But the funny thing
about an acronym

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:07.265 align:middle line:84%
is it means nothing
to anyone until you

00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:08.599 align:middle line:90%
know what the acronym means.

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.201 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't read something.

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:12.403 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, I'm
thinking, and I said, I

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:14.238 align:middle line:90%
have another seminar coming up.

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:18.443 align:middle line:84%
I can't leave people calling
this all different things.

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:20.812 align:middle line:84%
The third and fourth
phrases said, what you're

00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:22.547 align:middle line:90%
doing is reconnecting strings.

00:41:22.547 --> 00:41:24.916 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is
reconnecting strings.

00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:28.252 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
temporarily, temporarily,

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:30.288 align:middle line:90%
I'll call it reconnection.

00:41:30.288 --> 00:41:33.291 align:middle line:84%
The Reconnection, or
Reconnective Healing.

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.527 align:middle line:84%
Because we can reconnect
with our original

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:39.964 align:middle line:84%
fullness the spirit
that we experience in

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.466 align:middle line:90%
between lifetimes.

00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:43.968 align:middle line:10%
And we can access that
here on the planet here.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:47.338 align:middle line:10%
But we are reconnecting with
something that is continuously

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:51.109 align:middle line:10%
expanding and evolving so it
has no limitation of saying,

00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:53.845 align:middle line:10%
this is what it is and
this is what it isn't.

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:56.481 align:middle line:10%
And the moment that I called
it that name, people started

00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:59.150 align:middle line:10%
coming out of the woodwork
from everywhere, saying,

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.351 align:middle line:10%
I knew I had to come.

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:03.054 align:middle line:10%
And I realized the name was
right there in front of my eyes

00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:04.188 align:middle line:10%
the whole time.

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:06.391 align:middle line:84%
So you've said
to me in the past

00:42:06.391 --> 00:42:09.026 align:middle line:84%
that it's something that
is new in this world.

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:12.296 align:middle line:84%
This is an energy, a frequency,
that's new in this world.

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:15.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:19.337 align:middle line:84%
Many of the researchers
in the beginning

00:42:19.337 --> 00:42:22.039 align:middle line:84%
were the first to say
to me, we think this is

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.208 align:middle line:90%
here for the very first time.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.411 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's a
rather bold statement.

00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:30.081 align:middle line:84%
How can you make a
statement such as that?

00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:31.349 align:middle line:90%
Now, let me back up.

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:34.385 align:middle line:84%
Before they were saying that,
what my experience had been was

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.887 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, well,
this has got to be

00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:37.655 align:middle line:90%
coming through lots of people.

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:40.591 align:middle line:84%
So I went looking--
healers who were famous,

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:43.928 align:middle line:84%
healers who were not so famous,
healers started contacting me

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:47.365 align:middle line:84%
telling me they were sent
to me in their medications,

00:42:47.365 --> 00:42:48.099 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:42:48.099 --> 00:42:50.768 align:middle line:84%
And I met a lot of people who
said that they were healers.

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:52.503 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
were, and some of them

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:57.008 align:middle line:84%
were just as average a
healer as anyone else.

00:42:57.008 --> 00:43:02.713 align:middle line:84%
But none of them, not one of
them, had this coming through.

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:07.618 align:middle line:84%
And yet instantly-- and
interestingly enough,

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:10.288 align:middle line:84%
the moment you interact
with this, with Reconnective

00:43:10.288 --> 00:43:12.356 align:middle line:90%
Healing, you do care.

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:15.026 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, people, my
patients, who were coming out

00:43:15.026 --> 00:43:18.763 align:middle line:84%
of my office, whether they came
in with no background in energy

00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:20.431 align:middle line:84%
healing, a little
background, or whether they

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:25.336 align:middle line:84%
were grandmaster teachers, every
one of them rose to this level.

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:26.504 align:middle line:84%
Wow.
Interesting.

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:32.176 align:middle line:84%
So, move that to one
aspect, and then here

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:34.512 align:middle line:84%
are these healers, these
researchers, saying,

00:43:34.512 --> 00:43:37.148 align:middle line:84%
we think it's here on the
planet for the very first time.

00:43:37.148 --> 00:43:39.417 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how can you make
such a statement like that?

00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:40.885 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:44.989 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, the
reason that we suspect

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:48.593 align:middle line:84%
that is because everything
that they've ever discovered

00:43:48.593 --> 00:43:51.028 align:middle line:84%
in looking at healing,
from energy healing,

00:43:51.028 --> 00:43:53.297 align:middle line:90%
has been contained in this.

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:55.766 align:middle line:84%
Something here is contained
in reiki, something here in qi

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.102 align:middle line:84%
gong, something here in
alpha beta delta gamma,

00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:00.104 align:middle line:84%
or whatever we call
the techniques,

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:02.173 align:middle line:90%
already contained in this.

00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:03.808 align:middle line:84%
And yet yours seems
to contain, what

00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:06.377 align:middle line:84%
comes through you and
the people you've taught,

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:07.778 align:middle line:84%
everything that's
in here and more

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:10.081 align:middle line:90%
than we've ever seen before.

00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:11.716 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, but
still, how can you

00:44:11.716 --> 00:44:13.718 align:middle line:84%
say you think it's here on
the planet for the first time?

00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:15.386 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we'll
just have to understand

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:16.754 align:middle line:90%
two basic concepts.

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.890 align:middle line:84%
A, we are
four-dimensional beings.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.492 align:middle line:84%
We are height, width,
depth, and time.

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:24.161 align:middle line:84%
When we went to school, we were
told we were three-dimensional,

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:27.064 align:middle line:84%
but Einstein had told
us since the '50s we're

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:28.900 align:middle line:84%
four-dimensional,
and in the year 2000,

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.735 align:middle line:90%
science formally accepted it.

00:44:30.735 --> 00:44:33.771 align:middle line:84%
So our four-dimensional
existence in quantum physics

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:35.339 align:middle line:84%
is often illustrated
as a bubbles.

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.241 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, here's
this little bubble.

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:38.743 align:middle line:84%
The wall or the
cell of the bubble

00:44:38.743 --> 00:44:40.611 align:middle line:84%
is height, width,
depth, and time.

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
interior is energy.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.315 align:middle line:90%
Everything here has been energy.

00:44:44.315 --> 00:44:48.085 align:middle line:84%
Everything outside is the rest
of this huge multi-dimensional

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:49.620 align:middle line:90%
endless universe.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.856 align:middle line:84%
So here's our
bubble of existence.

00:44:51.856 --> 00:44:54.292 align:middle line:84%
And the energy healing
we've accessed here

00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:56.761 align:middle line:84%
has been different
subsets of the energy--

00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:59.730 align:middle line:84%
reiki, qi gong, whatever we
want to call these things.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:04.001 align:middle line:84%
But second understanding,
time is moving faster.

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Time has been moving
faster, but it's

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.105 align:middle line:90%
dramatically moving faster.

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:11.542 align:middle line:84%
The harmonic convergence in
1987, the harmonic concordance

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:14.579 align:middle line:90%
in 2002, stepping into 2012.

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:16.981 align:middle line:84%
Time isn't moving faster
linearly from point A

00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:20.117 align:middle line:84%
to point B. It's moving faster
in all directions at once,

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:22.587 align:middle line:84%
which means it's
expanding, which means

00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:25.890 align:middle line:84%
our bubble of existence is
opening up and expanding

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.058 align:middle line:90%
further out into the universe.

00:45:27.058 --> 00:45:29.760 align:middle line:84%
It's accessing more of
what's always been here

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.762 align:middle line:90%
outside of our time and energy.

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.264 align:middle line:84%
You put that very
clearly as to what

00:45:33.264 --> 00:45:35.266 align:middle line:84%
many people are experiencing.
Yes, yes.

00:45:35.266 --> 00:45:36.968 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:36.968 --> 00:45:39.403 align:middle line:84%
So it's always existed
outside of here,

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:42.506 align:middle line:90%
outside of the bubble of time.

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:45.309 align:middle line:84%
So it's in our bubble
now for the first time.

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:47.778 align:middle line:90%
In other words, it's timeless.

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:49.313 align:middle line:90%
It's been timeless.

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:50.715 align:middle line:84%
And now that it's
here, it's new.

00:45:50.715 --> 00:45:52.016 align:middle line:90%
It's not old.

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:53.985 align:middle line:84%
Now, this concept can
tend to royally piss

00:45:53.985 --> 00:45:56.020 align:middle line:84%
off a lot of the
new age community,

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.289 align:middle line:84%
because they want
everything to be old.

00:45:58.289 --> 00:46:01.158 align:middle line:84%
So they can say things
such as, I remember this

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:04.695 align:middle line:84%
from my past lifetime when I
was Cleopatra for the 33rd time

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:07.231 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis Immemoria, because
I was the only Cleopatra who

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:09.100 align:middle line:90%
could bilocate between the two.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.669 align:middle line:84%
And you know, guess
what-- sometimes

00:46:11.669 --> 00:46:13.204 align:middle line:90%
something was just new.

00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:14.839 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that
wonderful, because we

00:46:14.839 --> 00:46:18.609 align:middle line:84%
are also here for what's now.
-Right.

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go
back to the slides,

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.747 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted people to
understand, what the energy is.

00:46:22.747 --> 00:46:24.582 align:middle line:10%
This next slide that we're
taking a look at here

00:46:24.582 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:10%
shows what the hands looked
like before the healing and then

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.221 align:middle line:10%
during the energy.

00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:32.223 align:middle line:10%
If you could explain
just quickly about this.

00:46:32.223 --> 00:46:35.393 align:middle line:10%
Well, you can see the
significant increase

00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:37.928 align:middle line:10%
in the blood flow
during the healing.

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:43.701 align:middle line:10%
That's what this particular
way of photography, that's

00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:45.136 align:middle line:10%
what this handles.

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:49.173 align:middle line:10%
EPC or Kirlian photography
shows energetic fields,

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.742 align:middle line:10%
which shows the same
increase during the healings.

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:55.279 align:middle line:10%
But what's really interesting
is that this healing

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:59.617 align:middle line:10%
comes about after you've
interacted with it.

00:46:59.617 --> 00:47:01.318 align:middle line:84%
And you do have to
interact with it.

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:03.054 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
becomes activated

00:47:03.054 --> 00:47:03.921 align:middle line:90%
once you interact with it.

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Is it several times,
over several times?

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.658 align:middle line:90%
No, not necessarily.

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:10.127 align:middle line:90%
Fairly instantaneously.

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:13.564 align:middle line:84%
But it comes about once you
place your attention on it.

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:17.735 align:middle line:84%
Now, this became a little
problematic for the testing,

00:47:17.735 --> 00:47:21.672 align:middle line:84%
because I remember even at
Jackson Memorial Hospital, one

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.974 align:middle line:84%
of the more straight
laced places,

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:26.343 align:middle line:84%
the University of
Miami, when they

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:30.314 align:middle line:84%
did the Kirlian photography,
before the EPC had come about,

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe, or was well
known, and they had me place

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:35.119 align:middle line:84%
my fingers on a plate--
and you can see this

00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:37.621 align:middle line:84%
somewhere on the website, I
believe, this picture's up.

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:40.658 align:middle line:84%
Place your fingers on the
plate, and they measured it.

00:47:40.658 --> 00:47:43.828 align:middle line:84%
Now, turn the healing on
was, I think, their phrase.

00:47:43.828 --> 00:47:45.062 align:middle line:90%
Well, you don't turn it on.

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:46.831 align:middle line:90%
You become aware of it.

00:47:46.831 --> 00:47:48.399 align:middle line:90%
So here we are with the healing.

00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:49.533 align:middle line:84%
So they measured
with the healing.

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:50.868 align:middle line:90%
And they said, now turn it off.

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do you turn it off?

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.073 align:middle line:84%
What they're saying is,
don't think about it.

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.641 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do you
not think about it?

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Don't think about red.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:03.447 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is,
you somehow distract

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:04.915 align:middle line:90%
yourself as best as possible.

00:48:04.915 --> 00:48:08.219 align:middle line:84%
But it's always on a little
bit once you've accessed it.

00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:10.755 align:middle line:84%
And then once you place your
attention on it, there's more.

00:48:10.755 --> 00:48:13.958 align:middle line:10%
So you see that during
the feeling the energy,

00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:15.826 align:middle line:10%
there's a certain
level of blood flow.

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:21.132 align:middle line:10%
After feeling it, there's
still extended blood flow.

00:48:21.132 --> 00:48:25.936 align:middle line:10%
So it exists in a
non-linear fashion.

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:29.073 align:middle line:10%
It's before, during, and after.

00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:31.375 align:middle line:10%
I believe there are two
of these slides, right.

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.644 align:middle line:10%
Blood flow was usually--
OK, in this slide,

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.513 align:middle line:10%
it says blood flow
was usually still high

00:48:35.513 --> 00:48:37.848 align:middle line:10%
when the healer tried
to stop feeling energy,

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:41.385 align:middle line:10%
because you can't stop.

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:46.090 align:middle line:10%
It's as if I just sprayed some
perfume onto you and I say,

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.758 align:middle line:10%
all right, smell the perfume.
Good.

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:48.993 align:middle line:90%
OK, now I want to measure you.

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:50.361 align:middle line:90%
Stop smelling the perfume.

00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:53.264 align:middle line:84%
Well, how the hell
do you do that?

00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:54.064 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:56.333 align:middle line:90%
But that makes sense.

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:58.669 align:middle line:84%
Science is attempting to
validate something that they

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:00.204 align:middle line:84%
needed to put into
a linear form,

00:49:00.204 --> 00:49:04.141 align:middle line:84%
and this is a non-linear, more
of a quantum type of concept.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:07.478 align:middle line:84%
We confuse a lot of
things with saying, well,

00:49:07.478 --> 00:49:10.247 align:middle line:84%
it must be real because
science discovered it.

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:12.383 align:middle line:84%
And we forget that if
things weren't real

00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:14.718 align:middle line:84%
before science discovered
it, then science

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:16.086 align:middle line:90%
would have nothing to discover.

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:18.122 align:middle line:84%
But still, it's very important
for-- we do need to see this.

00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:20.224 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is very important.

00:49:20.224 --> 00:49:24.662 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, the energy
happens before, it happens

00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:25.963 align:middle line:90%
during, it happens after.

00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:28.332 align:middle line:84%
But yet you said your
hands tend to get cold.

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:29.033 align:middle line:90%
Could we actually--

00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:30.768 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're cold,
and sometimes they're warm.

00:49:30.768 --> 00:49:31.735 align:middle line:84%
You want to feel it?
Sure.

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:33.637 align:middle line:84%
-Yes, I do.
-I'll slide forward.

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Hold one hand up like that
with your fingers open.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.174 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:41.645 align:middle line:84%
Now, I come in, and my whole
arm sort of begins to float.

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:45.516 align:middle line:84%
If I push it down, it just
wants to float back up again.

00:49:45.516 --> 00:49:47.251 align:middle line:90%
And I watch your fingertips.

00:49:47.251 --> 00:49:49.486 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if the
camera can pick it up,

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:50.955 align:middle line:84%
but you have tiny
little jerks going

00:49:50.955 --> 00:49:53.224 align:middle line:84%
on in your ring finder-- see
it, in your middle finger now?

00:49:53.224 --> 00:49:53.924 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.092 align:middle line:90%
Those are involuntary.

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:56.694 align:middle line:84%
-Involuntary movements.
-Right, I see it.

00:49:56.694 --> 00:49:59.897 align:middle line:84%
So what I tend to
do now is I stretch,

00:49:59.897 --> 00:50:01.465 align:middle line:84%
or I pull the sensation.
-Wow.

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.900 align:middle line:90%
It become stronger, doesn't it?

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.603 align:middle line:84%
It feels like you have
strings attached to my fingers.

00:50:05.603 --> 00:50:06.537 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:50:06.537 --> 00:50:08.739 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is not energy healing.

00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:10.875 align:middle line:84%
What we know about
energy is that it

00:50:10.875 --> 00:50:12.176 align:middle line:90%
gets weaker with distance.

00:50:12.176 --> 00:50:15.512 align:middle line:84%
But you see this,
it becomes stronger.

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.581 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen my fingers
twitch like that before.

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.649 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:50:18.649 --> 00:50:20.217 align:middle line:84%
See that movement
that just happened?

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:24.054 align:middle line:84%
I probably blocked
it from the camera.

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:25.389 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if I play
with it this way.

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:26.223 align:middle line:90%
Wow, interesting.

00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:28.192 align:middle line:84%
We'll see if that
changes anything.

00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:28.859 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there it goes.

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.327 align:middle line:84%
See how it just--
and now it just

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:31.962 align:middle line:90%
pulled that finger backwards.

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:35.366 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I do this, you either
get a sensation or you don't.

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:36.734 align:middle line:90%
So you tell me.

00:50:36.734 --> 00:50:38.669 align:middle line:90%
I can't bend that finger.

00:50:38.669 --> 00:50:40.237 align:middle line:84%
-You can't bend the finger.
-No.

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:40.938 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:50:40.938 --> 00:50:41.705 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:42.406 align:middle line:90%
That is interesting.

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:44.608 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.744 align:middle line:84%
Now, close your
eyes for a moment.

00:50:46.744 --> 00:50:48.612 align:middle line:90%
Keep your eyes closed.

00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:51.548 align:middle line:84%
Are your eyes still,
or are they moving?

00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:52.549 align:middle line:84%
-Moving.
-Uh-huh.

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:54.051 align:middle line:90%
Now, stop them from moving.

00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:55.219 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:56.553 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead, stop them.

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:57.855 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're just
darting, darting.

00:50:57.855 --> 00:50:59.123 align:middle line:84%
-Can't stop them, can you?
-No.

00:50:59.123 --> 00:51:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Uh-uh.
-Isn't that weird?

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.225 align:middle line:84%
Open your eyes.
-That is very interesting.

00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Look how far away I am.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.863 align:middle line:84%
What could I possibly
be doing out here

00:51:05.863 --> 00:51:07.498 align:middle line:90%
that's affecting your eyes.

00:51:07.498 --> 00:51:09.934 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:51:09.934 --> 00:51:11.735 align:middle line:90%
But science is--

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:15.139 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to--

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:16.707 align:middle line:90%
But what really is science?

00:51:16.707 --> 00:51:18.542 align:middle line:84%
Something that is
consistently reproducible

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:19.543 align:middle line:90%
under the same conditions.

00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:20.344 align:middle line:90%
Your hands are so cold.

00:51:20.344 --> 00:51:22.479 align:middle line:84%
They get cold sometimes
when I do this.

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.882 align:middle line:84%
-But when--
-They're blue.

00:51:24.882 --> 00:51:26.150 align:middle line:84%
You felt it was
their temperature?

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.451 align:middle line:84%
Look at the color
of your hands.

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:28.619 align:middle line:90%
They're almost blue.

00:51:28.619 --> 00:51:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.055 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it gets
cold when I do this.

00:51:31.055 --> 00:51:33.757 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I get warm
when this happens,

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:36.327 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't mean
that you're feeling

00:51:36.327 --> 00:51:37.661 align:middle line:90%
the same coolness or warmth.

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.797 align:middle line:84%
You might be feeling warmth
even though I'm feeling

00:51:39.797 --> 00:51:42.566 align:middle line:84%
a coolness, or vice versa.
-Interesting.

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:45.202 align:middle line:84%
So I did start to tell you
something, but it left my mind.

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:45.869 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:48.172 align:middle line:84%
That was really interesting,
because your fingers

00:51:48.172 --> 00:51:50.140 align:middle line:90%
literally changed color.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.276 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's
shown in the slides

00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:53.510 align:middle line:84%
that we were looking
at earlier, is

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:57.448 align:middle line:84%
that the color and the
temperature of your hands,

00:51:57.448 --> 00:51:59.683 align:middle line:84%
and the person's hands
who was in the slide--

00:51:59.683 --> 00:52:04.254 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can learn to begin
to access this on a basic level

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:05.289 align:middle line:90%
on your own from the book.

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:07.291 align:middle line:84%
There's a basic
how-to in the book

00:52:07.291 --> 00:52:08.559 align:middle line:90%
that teaches you how to do it.

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:11.228 align:middle line:84%
It does not teach you how
to become a Reconnective

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:12.229 align:middle line:90%
Healing practitioner.

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:14.631 align:middle line:84%
You can't read the book and
say, I'm a Reconnective Healing

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:17.067 align:middle line:84%
practitioner any more
than you can read a book

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:90%
on hairstyling or dentistry.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:21.772 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you read a book
on hairstyling and dentistry,

00:52:21.772 --> 00:52:24.041 align:middle line:84%
you'll probably take better care
of your hair and your teeth,

00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:25.943 align:middle line:84%
but you can't hang a shingle
out and say that you're

00:52:25.943 --> 00:52:27.878 align:middle line:90%
a dentist or a hairstylist.

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.179 align:middle line:90%
It's the same with this book.

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:30.848 align:middle line:84%
It will teach you
how to access it

00:52:30.848 --> 00:52:35.019 align:middle line:84%
initially for your own family,
yourself, your immediate work.

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:38.222 align:middle line:10%
But to learn how to do
this, I'm on the road

00:52:38.222 --> 00:52:41.358 align:middle line:10%
approximately 42 weeks
a year around the world

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:42.526 align:middle line:10%
teaching seminars.

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:43.594 align:middle line:10%
And you have this much energy.

00:52:43.594 --> 00:52:47.631 align:middle line:10%
We actually have a video of what
the seminars are, a little bit

00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:50.134 align:middle line:10%
of what people experience
when they're experiencing

00:52:50.134 --> 00:52:51.335 align:middle line:10%
the Reconnective Healing.
Let's take a look at that.

00:52:51.335 --> 00:52:52.803 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure what you
have, but let's look.

00:52:52.803 --> 00:52:54.071 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's take a look at it.

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:02.613 align:middle line:84%
So these are the involuntary
physical registers or responses

00:53:02.613 --> 00:53:05.416 align:middle line:84%
that people have when you
experience the Reconnective

00:53:05.416 --> 00:53:07.918 align:middle line:90%
Healing frequencies.

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:09.987 align:middle line:84%
You see the involuntary movement
of the mouth and the nose,

00:53:09.987 --> 00:53:11.255 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:53:11.255 --> 00:53:12.856 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: That's what
was happening to my hand.

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.825 align:middle line:84%
ERIC PEARL: Here you can
see involuntary movement

00:53:14.825 --> 00:53:18.262 align:middle line:84%
in the breathing and also
movement around the mouth

00:53:18.262 --> 00:53:19.596 align:middle line:90%
and the swallowing increases.

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:25.169 align:middle line:84%
This tends to happen
with virtually everyone

00:53:25.169 --> 00:53:27.571 align:middle line:90%
who's there at the seminars.

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:29.873 align:middle line:90%
LISA GARR: Right.

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.309 align:middle line:84%
And then when people
experience this,

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:34.945 align:middle line:84%
do they have pain
that's disappeared?

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:36.647 align:middle line:90%
Is that commonly what you hear?

00:53:36.647 --> 00:53:37.347 align:middle line:90%
ERIC PEARL: Yeah.

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:40.484 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, the seminars are
not-- here's another example

00:53:40.484 --> 00:53:41.618 align:middle line:90%
of involuntary registers.

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:44.154 align:middle line:84%
The head tends to
rock and respond.

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:45.355 align:middle line:90%
And the eyes move.

00:53:45.355 --> 00:53:48.525 align:middle line:84%
Remember, people are not
coming to the seminars

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:50.160 align:middle line:90%
for their own personal healing.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.930 align:middle line:84%
They're coming to the seminars
to learn how to do the healing.

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.832 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you're
going to medical school,

00:53:54.832 --> 00:53:56.867 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to medical school

00:53:56.867 --> 00:53:58.602 align:middle line:84%
and confusing it with
a visit to your doctor.

00:53:58.602 --> 00:54:00.304 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
medical school to learn

00:54:00.304 --> 00:54:02.272 align:middle line:90%
how to become a doctor.

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:05.008 align:middle line:90%
So that's part of what happens.

00:54:05.008 --> 00:54:07.277 align:middle line:84%
What occurs at the
seminars is it's

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:09.947 align:middle line:84%
usually held on a Friday night,
all day Saturday, and all day

00:54:09.947 --> 00:54:10.848 align:middle line:90%
Sunday.

00:54:10.848 --> 00:54:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Friday night is a
three-hour presentation.

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.152 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
history of the work.

00:54:15.152 --> 00:54:18.789 align:middle line:84%
See the involuntary movement
of the fingers and the hands?

00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:20.491 align:middle line:84%
OK, those are some of
the secondary registers.

00:54:23.527 --> 00:54:27.197 align:middle line:84%
LISA GARR: So now,
these are other people

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:28.332 align:middle line:90%
that are doing these healings.

00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:29.733 align:middle line:84%
ERIC PEARL: These are
just people who have

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:32.035 align:middle line:90%
attended the seminars, right.

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:34.972 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
are working on them

00:54:34.972 --> 00:54:38.075 align:middle line:84%
are seminar attendees,
who've learned how to do it.

00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:39.977 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'll explain
how that works.

00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:43.180 align:middle line:84%
On a Friday night, generally I
give a three-hour presentation.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.315 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the history
of the work, the theory

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:46.950 align:middle line:90%
of the work, the philosophy.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.919 align:middle line:84%
We bring up some
volunteers in the audience,

00:54:48.919 --> 00:54:50.821 align:middle line:84%
give live demonstrations
of the healing,

00:54:50.821 --> 00:54:52.789 align:middle line:84%
so you can see
the reality of it.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:54.758 align:middle line:84%
And we give everyone
an opportunity

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:58.061 align:middle line:84%
to feel this in your hand, sort
of like I just did with you.

00:54:58.061 --> 00:55:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Saturday and Sunday is
very different, though.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.799 align:middle line:84%
It's a real, real
working seminar.

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:05.235 align:middle line:84%
So I tell everyone-- and
I mean it-- don't come.

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:07.437 align:middle line:84%
And I mean it-- don't come
if you think we're all going

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:10.908 align:middle line:84%
to sit around and hold hands and
ohm and sing, kumbaya, my lord.

00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:12.876 align:middle line:90%
It won't happen that way.

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:15.812 align:middle line:84%
We demonstrate a level of the
healing clearly from the stage,

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:19.383 align:middle line:84%
then we all go to massage
tables in groups of two or four,

00:55:19.383 --> 00:55:20.083 align:middle line:90%
give or take.

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:22.452 align:middle line:84%
I walk around to each
of the tables myself.

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:24.254 align:middle line:84%
So does our team of
teaching assistants.

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:27.424 align:middle line:84%
We help teach you how to
feel this, how to find it.

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:29.526 align:middle line:84%
You start to see the
person on the table

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:31.828 align:middle line:84%
go into involuntary
physical registers,

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:33.530 align:middle line:90%
like we just saw on the tape.

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:35.465 align:middle line:84%
Then we teach you how
to feel something else,

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:37.801 align:middle line:84%
and you see their registers
change to something else,

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:42.239 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to recognize
your clear distinct interaction

00:55:42.239 --> 00:55:44.074 align:middle line:84%
with escorting them
into a healing place.

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:47.611 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of that one
weekend-- one weekend, not six

00:55:47.611 --> 00:55:50.914 align:middle line:84%
months or a year, one
weekend-- I can pretty much

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:52.616 align:middle line:90%
make you two promises.

00:55:52.616 --> 00:55:54.985 align:middle line:84%
A, you will be
able to do anything

00:55:54.985 --> 00:55:57.287 align:middle line:84%
and everything in the way
of healing that I can do.

00:55:57.287 --> 00:56:00.257 align:middle line:84%
And B, you will be able to
do anything and everything

00:56:00.257 --> 00:56:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in the way of healing that
any human being anywhere

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.362 align:middle line:84%
on this planet can do, whether
they were raised by monks

00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:07.931 align:middle line:84%
in a cave and a mountaintop in
Tibet and fed grains of seed,

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:10.867 align:middle line:84%
each one blessed by its
own individual Lama.

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:12.736 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter the story.

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:15.339 align:middle line:84%
You know what matters
today is our willingness

00:56:15.339 --> 00:56:17.341 align:middle line:90%
to transcend the story.

00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:23.880 align:middle line:84%
We are given a gift of
being able to demystify

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.816 align:middle line:90%
the healing process.

00:56:25.816 --> 00:56:27.918 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is whether or
not we're willing to allow

00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:29.319 align:middle line:90%
it to be demystified.

00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We're given a gift today of
transcending the complications,

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:36.960 align:middle line:84%
the fear-based rituals, and
control-based techniques

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.861 align:middle line:90%
of healing.

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:39.363 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge
is whether or not

00:56:39.363 --> 00:56:41.365 align:middle line:84%
we're willing to
transcend the techniques

00:56:41.365 --> 00:56:43.033 align:middle line:90%
to achieve greater healings.

00:56:43.033 --> 00:56:45.636 align:middle line:84%
And the question then
becomes, if we're not

00:56:45.636 --> 00:56:48.505 align:middle line:84%
willing to transcend the
techniques to access more,

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.407 align:middle line:90%
we need to ask ourselves why.

00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:53.110 align:middle line:84%
If we're not willing to allow
the healing process to become

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:56.346 align:middle line:84%
clearer and demystified,
transparent for everyone,

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:57.781 align:middle line:90%
we need to ask ourselves why.

00:56:57.781 --> 00:56:59.816 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not willing
to ask ourselves why,

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:03.053 align:middle line:84%
then we need to ask ourselves
why we're not willing to ask

00:57:03.053 --> 00:57:06.223 align:middle line:84%
ourselves why, because it's
within that question that

00:57:06.223 --> 00:57:09.293 align:middle line:90%
lies the gift to our mastery.

00:57:09.293 --> 00:57:11.928 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
empowering, your message is.

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And it takes the guru
out of the picture

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.867 align:middle line:84%
and puts the healing into
our own responsibility.

00:57:16.867 --> 00:57:17.768 align:middle line:84%
-Our own hands.
-Yeah.

00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:19.336 align:middle line:90%
Our own hands, basically.

00:57:19.336 --> 00:57:21.204 align:middle line:90%
And so, thank you so much.

00:57:21.204 --> 00:57:25.275 align:middle line:84%
Your story, it was
fascinating and engaging.

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:29.246 align:middle line:84%
The scientific evidence
is also equally intriguing

00:57:29.246 --> 00:57:31.081 align:middle line:90%
to see the temperature changes.

00:57:31.081 --> 00:57:34.718 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that you can teach
other people to do this really

00:57:34.718 --> 00:57:37.120 align:middle line:90%
connects it full circle for me.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.522 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:57:38.522 --> 00:57:39.890 align:middle line:84%
You are amazing--
-It's my pleasure.

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:42.059 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
