00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:10.154 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going
to go on a journey

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:84%
of transformational hypnosis
with master teacher and trainer

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Christopher Howard.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
He's also the CEO of
Rock House Global.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.845 align:middle line:84%
And according to Chris,
one of the biggest mistakes

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:84%
that people make
about hypnosis is

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:84%
that they think
you lose control,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually the
furthest thing from the truth.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
All hypnosis is self-hypnosis,
and Chris is here

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:84%
as a guide to take us on a
journey of learning our fullest

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:90%
sense of power and self-control.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:90%
So welcome.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.425 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS HOWARD: Wow!

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.133 align:middle line:90%
That was quite the introduction.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I like that, too.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you got it spot on.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.705 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
is the difference

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:84%
between transformational
hypnosis

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and the traditional
hypnosis that we see,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe the stage shows
in Vegas type of thing?

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Right.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it's
the same thing.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Because what it's about,
it's about getting out

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:84%
of your own way and
revealing potential

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
that-- potential the potential
that you didn't know you had.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.264 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in a stage
show, and a lot of people

00:01:13.264 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
will see in stage
shows on TV or they've

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:90%
gone to Vegas, like you say.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And somebody's told
you are now Michael Jackson

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and they come on out,
oh, and they dance.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.766 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, was
that always within them

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
to do that and
the answer is yes.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: You know, that
talent was always there.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.756 align:middle line:84%
But most people
play small in life.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Most people get
in their own way.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.762 align:middle line:84%
And when we can get
out of our own way,

00:01:32.762 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing that
we can't accomplish.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're doing it for
entertainment purposes on stage

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:84%
or we're doing it
just in our own life,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:90%
essentially it's the same thing.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
We're using the power of our
imagination to fuel a change

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:90%
and to get out of our own way.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what are some
examples of self-hypnosis?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.499 align:middle line:84%
Like how do we just
go into hypnotic gazes

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day?

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:90%
We do this all the time, right?

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: We do it all
the time, but not only

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:84%
do we do it all the time
throughout the day from-- we

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
could say we go into a trance,
like a driving trance where

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:84%
you're driving your
car and you wonder

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:90%
how you got in your driveway.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.783 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:90%
It happens to me all the time.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.195 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Or you're
in the elevator

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and they even have an induction
that goes 10, nine, eight,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and then you walk
off and you realize

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.149 align:middle line:84%
you're on the
wrong floor, right?

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:90%
I think we've all--

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, yes.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.706 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've never
done that have you?

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, I have.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Of course, yes.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're
in and out of what

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
one might call trance
states all the time.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But, for me, all of
life is a trance state.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I say that
is because there's a phrase that

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
was-- you know, the first
time I heard it was in 1933.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there personally.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.164 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I hope not.

00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:32.982 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:32.982 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: A guy by the
name of Alfred Korzybski

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.648 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called
"Science and Sanity."

00:02:36.648 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And in that book--
it's all about sanity.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And inside that book, he
says that the map is not

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:90%
the territory.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.732 align:middle line:84%
Even the best map of California
built full to scale still

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be California.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.045 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And you wouldn't
go to the restaurant

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and eat the menu.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:90%
The menu represents the food.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And our
thoughts and our model

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
of the world, our unique
way of looking at the world,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:90%
is an internal representation.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So we experience the world
inside our head, right?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.915 align:middle line:84%
And people mistake the map
for being the territory

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.905 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about life--
and when I say the map,

00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
our internal thoughts

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:90%
that we have inside our mind.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.709 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: But also the
basis of our personality,

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, our
values, our beliefs,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
our attitudes about life
that we've been programmed

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and conditioned to
accept over time.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And your programming
is completely

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
different than the programming
of Richard Branson or Jimmy

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Buffett.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't say Warren
Buffett, I said Jimmy.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: It's
different programming.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.443 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Reality is subjective.

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And the life that we
create is a result

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, what we
project out onto the world.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.534 align:middle line:84%
And so if we want to change
the results in our life,

00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
we can get inside and we
can change the programming.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.547 align:middle line:84%
But people mistake their
programming for being reality.

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:90%
So we can enrich it.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:90%
We can change it.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's a trance
state, when they

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:84%
believe what their
thoughts to be real.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So someone like a
Richard Branson's internal map

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
of the world is different than
my internal map of the world,

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:90%
because I don't--

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Sure, yeah.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -own Virgin
everything, right?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Virgin
everything, yeah.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, you know, I'm
not the multi-billion dollar

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:90%
brand he is.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.255 align:middle line:90%
He has a different role.

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: You're getting close.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.963 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: All right.

00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But if I were
to be into that-- like,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
want to create
something like that,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I would need to be
modeling him and looking

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:90%
at life from that map?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Well, you can
think about it that way.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.383 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or that territory?

00:04:21.383 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: It's like we each
have our own internal map.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a very
famous hypnotist, he

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.175 align:middle line:84%
was actually a classically
trained psychiatrist,

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Dr.
Milton Erickson who

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.192 align:middle line:84%
said that each of us has a
unique model of the world

00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that's as unique
as our thumbprint.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.816 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: So we have a unique
way of looking at the world,

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:90%
expecting the world to show up.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
A unique way of
operating in the world.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Unique strategies,
unique tactics

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that we use that have literally
been programmed and conditioned

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:90%
into the neurology.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we think of
our habits, our habits

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:90%
are actualized neural pathways.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
They're an order and
sequence of neurons

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that fire off, like a
finely grooved road.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you have the tools
of-- we call it hypnosis,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.547 align:middle line:84%
but really it's the faculty
of your imagination.

00:05:02.547 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So Einstein said imagination is
more important than knowledge.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:84%
When you have the
tools of hypnosis,

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
you can use your imagination
to pave new neural pathways

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:90%
for change.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you have great models--
you take a Richard Branson,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
you could take somebody
who's producing

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary results,
you can look at that

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and you can repave and
re-pattern your own neurology

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
so that change becomes as simple
as taking a shortcut to work.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Once you find it, you
know how to take it.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.849 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:84%
That's-- I've modeled Oprah for
a long time and I've loved what

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:90%
she's done in the world.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And Oprah
modeled before her,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.096 align:middle line:84%
Oprah Winfrey said that before
she-- her first time on camera,

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:84%
the first time she did
an interview, she said

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:84%
she had no clue what to
do, so she sat the way

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Walters sat, she
asked questions the way

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Barbara Walters asked questions.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
good model, as well.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.397 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yes.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And Phil Donahue, she
modeled Phil Donahue.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So we all do that.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We have those role models that
we pattern ourselves after

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and they give us maps
for how to behave.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But when we engage the
function of the imagination

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and we really take ourselves
on journeys of imagination--

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.962 align:middle line:84%
it was a man by the name of
Neville, Neville Goddard.

00:06:07.962 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know you know
who Neville is.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.005 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Beautiful writer.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But he said that the
future will be no different

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
than the imaginal
activities of man,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's the imaginal
activities of man that

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.037 align:middle line:84%
create both our
present and our future.

00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: And so, hypnosis is--

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -really
about learning how

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
to take charge of
your imagination

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
to create whatever
future you want.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so now,
Erickson, as you mentioned,

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
there's a term that you've
taught me called Ericksonian

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.890 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis where you can actually
pace and lead people through

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:36.994 align:middle line:90%
a conversation--

00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Right.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -into their
desired outcome, right?

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Go ahead.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.386 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: So you've got
traditional hypnosis

00:06:45.386 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
where you might-- you know, when
most people think of hypnosis,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.668 align:middle line:84%
they think of direct
authoritarianism.

00:06:49.668 --> 00:06:51.042 align:middle line:84%
Direct authoritarian
is where you

00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:53.065 align:middle line:84%
say sit back, relax,
go into a trance.

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Now
we've also got-- we

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
have different
styles of hypnosis.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Erickson was very
conversational and he

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
was very-- one of the things
that Erickson said was he said,

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that a
client ought to be

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
able to go into a
trance in any way

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.987 align:middle line:84%
that he or she chooses
to go into a trance,

00:07:10.987 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and they ought to be able
to follow my suggestions

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
in any way that
he or she chooses

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
to follow my suggestions,
which is a permissive--

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, if you
think about what's

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.064 align:middle line:84%
presupposed underneath that
is they're going in a trance

00:07:22.064 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're following
suggestions.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.506 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Right.

00:07:24.506 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's a permissive
style of hypnosis.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But he was a kind man
with a-- you know,

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
he saw everybody as-- he thought
that everybody should have

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
a white house with
a white picket fence

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and two kids and a dog.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And he helped people to
have that perfect life

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
as he envisioned it,
or as they obviously

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:84%
had to have their
own input, right.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And he would help
them to do that.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So he was coming from
a really good place,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:90%
but he was a magician of change.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.842 align:middle line:90%
And he'd do it linguistically.

00:07:52.842 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Like you'd have a
conversation with him--

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -and you'd just
find yourself changing.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.868 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: That was
the magic of Erickson.

00:07:58.868 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Like if you went to see
Erickson for smoking cessation,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:84%
to stop smoking,
he might not ever

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:90%
talk about cigarettes directly.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
He might tell you about a
story about a dog on a bluff

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.940 align:middle line:84%
with a bone in its
mouth that wanted

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.199 align:middle line:84%
to drink the cool
fresh water in a dish,

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:84%
but it couldn't get to
the water because it

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to let
go of the bone.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.556 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And then you find
yourself walking outside

00:08:18.556 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about how
bad the therapy was

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because the guy didn't
mention cigarettes,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and you'd forget to
do the old problem.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:90%
You'd forget to smoke.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:90%
It would be a trigger point.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah,
brilliant, brilliant.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Magician of change.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You studied
him for a long time.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Studied Erickson.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I study a lot of different types
of tools for transformation.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, for me, it all
comes back to-- at some level,

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:90%
it does come back to hypnosis.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're constantly using
hypnosis in our own life

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.985 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like if somebody
doesn't stay on a diet,

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:84%
it's because their
imagination kicks in

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:84%
about how great the chocolate
cake's going to taste.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.383 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:08:48.383 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's a self-hypnosis
in the wrong direction.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Exactly.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Exactly.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.894 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But can we take our--
say we want to stay on a diet

00:08:54.894 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and we would look at that
picture of the bikini body

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that we put up on
our refrigerator.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.194 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: That's what I do.

00:08:59.194 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I look at the bikini body
and I say, I want it.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.353 align:middle line:90%
That's how I want to look.

00:09:02.353 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you put
in the refrigerator,

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.366 align:middle line:84%
but I open it and still
reach for whatever

00:09:08.366 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
is in there that isn't going
to give you the bikini body.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: You reached
right past the bikini body?

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.184 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Oh, my God.

00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.474 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that obviously
didn't work for me.

00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Right.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.764 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So--

00:09:17.764 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: I mean, it's like,
did it not work for you

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:90%
or did you not work it?

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.979 align:middle line:84%
Because there's always--
whenever-- whenever change--

00:09:23.979 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
whenever we're talking about
change and transformation,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
there's two things that
play-- interweave together.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got willpower and
we've got imagination.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.547 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: So like I tell
people with smoking,

00:09:37.547 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
because I just finished a
class out here in Los Angeles.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.117 align:middle line:84%
We had 600 people in
the class, big class,

00:09:42.117 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
they were all becoming certified
in transformational hypnosis.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.595 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Yeah,
it was very cool.

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:90%
It was good fun.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we did the class,
one of the things I say

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
is that whenever willpower and
imagination are in conflict,

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:90%
imagination will always win.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Because-- and that's how it is.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.492 align:middle line:84%
If you don't stay
in the relationship

00:09:59.492 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
it's because you're
imagining that the grass is

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:90%
greener on the other side.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or if you don't have
a big enough imagination

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:84%
around what the body could look
like, the imagination of how

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.015 align:middle line:84%
the cake will make
you feel is bigger.

00:10:11.015 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.075 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Well, that's what
happened in your case, right?

00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Because either your
willpower wasn't in check

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.563 align:middle line:84%
where you weren't
being an participate

00:10:17.563 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
in the-- active
participant in the change.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.902 align:middle line:84%
You were just looking
at the-- you're

00:10:22.902 --> 00:10:24.818 align:middle line:84%
looking at the body
going, yeah, I'd like that

00:10:24.818 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but I want that
chocolate cake more.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Or-- so the willpower's
is not in check there.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.296 align:middle line:84%
Or your imagination is
bigger-- you perceive

00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:84%
there to be a bigger benefit
from the cake in the moment.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's ways that
you can change that.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.206 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The secondary
gain was comfort.

00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: The emotional
benefit, right.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.955 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then I could go
after, what, the comfort

00:10:41.955 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and how that would
feel when I really

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.594 align:middle line:90%
have the diet that I want.

00:10:46.594 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Right.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.344 align:middle line:84%
Or how great will you feel
that emotional benefit when you

00:10:50.344 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
really-- when you're
lean and trim and--

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.126 align:middle line:84%

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.617 align:middle line:90%

00:10:58.617 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Because in the moment
we have emotional triggers that

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:90%
trigger responses--

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's all that.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -whether it be eating
to anesthetize our emotions

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:84%
or it be spending too
much or watching too much

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:84%
TV or drinking or drugs
or whatever people

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
do to anesthetize
their emotions and not

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.942 align:middle line:90%
deal with the things at hand.

00:11:17.942 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But that's their imagination
getting the best of them

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.585 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not preaching
at anybody because I've

00:11:23.585 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:84%
been in all those
same positions.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:90%
This is life.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:90%
We're human beings.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:84%
But you happen to have some-- a
tool or skill set here that can

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.725 align:middle line:84%
really help guide people
out of those triggers--

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: -which is great.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And once again,
I've had to guide myself out

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.810 align:middle line:84%
of my own triggers and I've
had to continually do that

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:84%
throughout life, because life is
a process of having challenges.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:84%
But when we got great tools,
we are more well-equipped

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and more ready to deal
with those things.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can you give
us an example of what--

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
some simple examples of how we
could use hypnosis in our life?

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, something that shows
us that we're good at it?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: I mean,
it's across the board,

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:84%
because-- and by the
way, the question really

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
becomes when do we not
use hypnosis in our life?

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly
using-- and this

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
is what I look to drill
into people's heads

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
is that there's never a moment
that you're not hypnotized.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you're mistaking
the map for the territory.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
You're mistaking your model
of the world, your beliefs,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.857 align:middle line:90%
your values as being real.

00:12:23.857 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.065 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:12:25.065 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
unique individual way

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the world,
but it's not real.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Reality is subjective.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.984 align:middle line:90%
We each have our own reality.

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we're mistaking
our model of the world

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.720 align:middle line:84%
for being real, so we're
constantly hypnotized anyway.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the thoughts
that we have either

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
hypnotize us to produce
extraordinary results

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
or to produce ordinary results
or below average results.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of joke
with people sometimes,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I say when you think about going
to the gym and working out,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
you know, are you your
own best coach mentally?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Are you going, I'm going to gym.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:90%
You're an athlete.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.328 align:middle line:90%
You're a warrior.

00:12:57.328 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:90%
You enjoy this.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:90%
You love working out.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:90%
You enjoy it.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:90%
You love eating right.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:90%
You eat healthy.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself right
now lean and trim.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:90%
You are an athlete.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
You're a warrior and
you love to workout.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:84%
You wake up early
and it feels good.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.141 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the voice-- is that
the dialogue that's going on

00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:90%
inside?

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Are those the pictures
that are going on inside?

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Or is it like, well, you
wake up in the morning

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and your alarm clock goes off.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.774 align:middle line:84%
Well, sleep's an important
part of health, too.

00:13:24.774 --> 00:13:25.274 align:middle line:90%

It's your thoughts.

00:13:29.551 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So it comes down to our
thoughts govern our reality.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing that
Napoleon Hill was saying back

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.201 align:middle line:90%
in "Think and Grow Rich."

00:13:36.201 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
then Rhonda Byrne

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:90%
was saying in "The Secret."

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing, but
very few people really

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:84%
understand how do you
take charge of that?

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And here's where hypnosis
comes into the picture

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
because we've all
heard that we only

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.454 align:middle line:84%
use 10% percent of our mind,
but neurobiologists these days

00:13:52.454 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
are saying that
it's only about 5%

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
of who we are that one would
consider to be conscious.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So 95% of who we are
would be unconscious.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:90%
That's the body mind.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.355 align:middle line:84%
The part of you that beats
your heart, that blinks you,

00:14:03.355 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
that circulate your
lymph, that breathes you.

using the Law of Attraction,

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:90%

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:14.451 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:90%

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.015 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a goal

that you want to
make more money,

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.973 align:middle line:84%

00:14:47.092 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:90%

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can we
find a way to know

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:84%
if we are suggestible
enough for hypnosis?

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Does everybody get-- is able--
they're able to get hypnotized

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:84%
or is there a way that
we could figure that out?

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.404 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: It's an
interesting question,

00:15:30.404 --> 00:15:32.545 align:middle line:84%
if we're suggestible
enough for hypnosis.

00:15:32.545 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
There was a couple
called the Hilgards that

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.335 align:middle line:84%
did some research
way back in the day.

00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:90%
That means a long time ago.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they
took people off the street

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and they played a
phonograph record,

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.743 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to see
how many people would

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:84%
go into trance by
simply listening

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.437 align:middle line:90%
to the photographic record.

00:15:47.437 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And they found that a certain
percent of people would go

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:84%
into a light hypnotic
trance, a certain percent--

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 20%
into a light trance,

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
60% into a medium trance,
another 20% into a heavier--

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:90%
a deep state of trance--

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -by simply
listening to the record.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.081 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
the Hilgard's research

00:16:04.081 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:84%
was that they took one important
part out of the equation, which

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:90%
was the teacher of the hypnosis.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And we say that all
hypnosis is about learning

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:90%
how to go into hypnosis.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:90%
So anybody can be taught trance.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can be taught
to utilize the power

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.917 align:middle line:90%
of their unconscious mind.

00:16:23.917 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when you align
your conscious intentions--

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%

unconscious resources,

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.251 align:middle line:84%
that's where you

00:16:29.251 --> 00:16:30.360 align:middle line:90%
moving toward your goals.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:90%

If you want to make
more money, if you

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:84%
want to have better
relationships.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have
to know your goals.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.306 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Well, you
have to know your goals,

00:16:37.306 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:84%
you have to get clear, so that's
why we say that intention--

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -is the most
important aspect of hypnosis.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.008 align:middle line:84%
And back to your
original question,

00:16:44.008 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
what's the difference between
stage and therapeutic hypnosis

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:90%
would be the intention.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Stage hypnosis, the
intention is to entertain.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: People follow
suggestions for that.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Therapeutic hypnosis, it
could be to make more money,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:84%
could be to improve
your relationships--

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Transform.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -transform
in some way.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In any way.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And so
when you-- the person

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
who's the teacher-- so as a
teacher of hypnosis, what you

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
do is you teach people
how to access the deepest

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:84%
resources of their
unconscious mind

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:12.151 align:middle line:84%
so that they have 100%
control over their own life.

00:17:12.151 --> 00:17:14.609 align:middle line:84%
Because when you can give your
body, your unconscious mind,

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.281 align:middle line:84%
the suggestion to shut
off pain and it does--

00:17:17.281 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:84%
Or to stop smoking,

I always-- I tell
people, I say, if you

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
fell in love with working

>>LISA: Yes, of course.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:84%

>>HOWARD: So-- and
all of these things

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.394 align:middle line:84%
are a function of
the imagination

00:17:49.394 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and all of these things
can be done with hypnosis.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And, as a matter of
fact, I'd go so far

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
as to say they are already
being done with hypnosis,

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:90%
just probably not so well.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In-- or in the

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the way
that you're shown

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.787 align:middle line:84%
that you'll have this

>>LISA: Ah.

00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:17.416 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: I have a dream.

He took people from a state, an
emotional state of resignation

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:84%
to a state of inspiration, and
they changed their behaviors

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and went out and changed
the face of a nation.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Through the dream,
through the imagery

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that he was able to
paint for people,

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
he was able to spark
that and that's really

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.786 align:middle line:90%
how hypnosis works.

00:18:32.786 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:84%
It's about creating
thoughts in the mind that

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:84%
are so real that we generate
emotions in our body.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And an emotion-- emotion is
like, it's behind all motion.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:43.469 align:middle line:90%

And our behaviors ultimately
determine our outcomes.

And so what a suggestibility
test is a teaching tool

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:84%
to teach somebody how to
attain the depths of trance

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
where they could
actually give suggestions

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to their unconscious mind

not yet, but in a moment,

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.165 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you to
open your fingers like this

00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle line:90%
about an inch apart.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.121 align:middle line:90%
Not yet, but in a moment.

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:06.646 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: When you do-- and you
can do this at home, too-- when

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
you do, I want you to watch
the space between your fingers

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and imagine and pretend--
and you have to do this.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it for you.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to fully
imagine and pretend

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that I put a vise
clamp on your fingers

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to watch
them draw together.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.051 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead right now
and open your fingers

00:20:23.051 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and watch the space
between them and watch

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
them coming closer and closer,
tighter and tighter, closer

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and closer.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming closer to you.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Tighter and tighter,
closer and closer.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Allow it to happen.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Want it to happen.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:90%
Will it to happen.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you have to do
this, I can't do it for you.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So bringing all the
way together now,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
coming all the way together,
closer and closer, tighter

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:90%
and tighter.

Tighter and tighter,
closer and closer.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.630 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: That is so weird, yes.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at you and
a part of me was like, OK,

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:90%
this is not-- yeah.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:90%

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:84%

move my fingers.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Of course they could.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you said I have
to be willing to do this.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And that's
the thing with hypnosis

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
is that people-- we've got
to change the way that people

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.554 align:middle line:90%
think about it.

00:21:23.554 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
They think that it's subjugating
your control to somebody else

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and that's not the case.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.450 align:middle line:84%
What it is, is it's allowing
you-- it's allowing you--

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
or you're allowing
yourself to get

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.806 align:middle line:84%
rid of what we call
the critical faculty.

00:21:36.806 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:84%
The critical faculty
is the part of you

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:84%
that distinguishes
fantasy from reality.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the-- we develop it
right around the age of seven

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:90%
to nine.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:45.525 align:middle line:84%
And it's the part of
you that says yeah,

00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I buy that, yeah,
I believe that,

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:84%
or no, I don't
believe that, right?

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.024 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- if you could imagine
a circle and you've got

00:21:54.024 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:84%
your conscious mind and
your unconscious mind,

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's split in half
with the critical faculty.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Well-- or it would be
split at 5%, right?

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Because 95% is unconscious.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And the critical-- so just
think of it as a band.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.048 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: So the critical
faculty develops over time,

00:22:08.048 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:90%
it's good that we have this.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I remember I grew up
here in Los Angeles,

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and when I was four years old,
I jumped off the second story

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.386 align:middle line:84%
building of my house because
I thought I could fly.

00:22:18.386 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And I
realized very quickly

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.362 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't fly, yet.

00:22:23.362 --> 00:22:23.862 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:23.862 --> 00:22:25.335 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:25.335 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Where did you land?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Exactly.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So we develop this
critical faculty,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's a good thing to do--

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -that we have
this critical faculty.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:90%

Yes.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.325 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

>>HOWARD: But when you're
a kid, everything's

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:34.915 align:middle line:90%
imagine and pretend.

00:22:34.915 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And it's as
if-- like my niece,

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Brittany, when
she was young, she

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:84%
had these two imaginary
friends, LaLa and Cuckoo.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And I remember having
Thanksgiving dinner with her

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and I said, are LaLa
and Cuckoo here,

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.852 align:middle line:84%
and she said, yes,
they're right there.

00:22:46.852 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's as if she saw them--

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -like they
were really right there.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have
that imagination.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:90%
We have a powerful imagination.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: We have a
powerful imagination.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you see a hypnotic
stage show and somebody says,

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:90%
see the tennis ball in my hand.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And they
go, what color is it

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.831 align:middle line:90%
and the person says it's green.

00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And they throw it in the air
and the person watches it--

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Right.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.233 align:middle line:84%
Do they really see a
tennis ball or are they

00:23:05.233 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
imagining and pretending so much
so that it's as if they saw it?

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.877 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if-- can you use
this type of imagination

00:23:11.877 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and this technique that
you're talking about

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to create more
wealth in your life?

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Absolutely.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing,
is because when

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:84%
you take a technique
like affirmations.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:90%
People use affirmations.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.410 align:middle line:84%
But the purpose
of an affirmation

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:30.471 align:middle line:84%
is to change a belief or a
value around a given subject.

00:23:30.471 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're
making affirmations

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:84%
because you want
to make more money.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I bel-- and you're
saying-- basically,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
what you're doing is you're
attempting to bludgeon your way

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
through the critical faculty
to the unconscious mind saying

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:90%
believe this, believe this--

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.751 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: -believe this, right?

00:23:41.751 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Now I remember running
on the beach when

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I was living in El Porto,
California, broke, right?

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Saying, you know, God's
wealth is flowing to me.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Money's coming to
me, I know it is.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.160 align:middle line:90%
I know it is.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.610 align:middle line:90%
It's going to come in.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with
that is that you've

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
got to chip your way through
this critical faculty

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:90%
that you've developed over time.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Now in
hypnosis, what we do

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.587 align:middle line:84%
is we remove the
critical faculty

00:24:02.587 --> 00:24:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and we send you back to what
we call the imprint period.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.753 align:middle line:84%
The imprint period,
according to sociologist

00:24:06.753 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Morris Massey
was age 0 to 7.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.716 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the neurology
in your body's firing

00:24:12.716 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:90%
off like crazy.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
The average baby makes 20
billion synaptic connections

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
That's about five
million a second.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.355 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: So the
neurology is firing off.

00:24:22.355 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.535 align:middle line:84%
And we think they're
just staring.

00:24:24.535 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:25.996 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we think
they're just staring,

00:24:25.996 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
but they're like a little
sponge soaking things in.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.440 align:middle line:84%
That's my kids are such
exquisite learners.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:90%

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.410 align:middle line:90%

>>HOWARD: -soak it in.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.546 align:middle line:84%
They're programmed,
they're conditioned--

00:24:34.546 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:84%
they become literally a replica
of their parents at that age.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Then they go out and they
find social models and stuff

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.309 align:middle line:84%
like that, like you
did in modeling Oprah.

00:24:43.309 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.632 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: So there is modeling
that happens beyond that,

00:24:46.632 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:84%
but in the beginning, you're
like this little sponge.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.256 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we do
in hypnosis is we

00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
get rid of the critical
faculty so that we can send you

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.198 align:middle line:84%
back to that stage
where you become

00:24:54.198 --> 00:24:56.614 align:middle line:84%
like that little sponge
for selective suggestions.

00:24:56.614 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's really important.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.815 align:middle line:84%
In a stage show, it has
to do with intentions,

00:24:59.815 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to entertain or see how
far you can take it.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: In
therapeutic hypnosis,

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.765 align:middle line:84%
you're going to accept
suggestions that are

00:25:04.765 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with-- if you're
coming to me to say you want

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:90%
to make more money--

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -I'm
assuming you're going

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.853 align:middle line:84%
to accept those
suggestions, once we get rid

00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
of the critical faculty.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to stand
on your chair and bark

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
like a dog or
quack like a duck--

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -or any of
those types of things,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.970 align:middle line:90%
because that's not why you came.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.771 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
the intention is.

00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's really--

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, so--

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: -important, too.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I form my intention
before I get to you

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and I say this is-- I don't
sit there and say, I am rich.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I sit there and
find out how I would

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.095 align:middle line:84%
have various revenues
of income and what

00:25:31.095 --> 00:25:32.595 align:middle line:84%
I could change in
terms of my state.

00:25:32.595 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Does that matter?

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Both of those
things come into play

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:84%
because your self-concept, I
am, your self-concept determines

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:90%
everything in your life.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether you perceived yourself
to be a rich man, a beggar

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:84%
man, a poor man or a thief,
that determines everything.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So it all starts
with self-concept.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But saying it is a far
cry from owning it.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.455 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-hm.

00:25:56.455 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: It's like Morpheus
said to Neo in "The Matrix."

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference
between knowing the path

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.230 align:middle line:90%
and walking the path.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And so that-- and
therein lies the challenge.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
With traditional
affirmations, we

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.040 align:middle line:84%
would be saying it,
attempting to make it

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
through the critical faculty.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.636 align:middle line:90%
Owning it is a different thing.

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And we get rid of
the critical faculty,

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.343 align:middle line:84%
just like when my niece
Brittany saw a LaLa-- yes,

00:26:15.343 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
they're right there,
LaLa and Cuckoo, that's

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:90%
when we can own it.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And so Dr. Erickson said
my best hypnotic subject

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:84%
became my best hypnotic subject
after 300 repeated inductions.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: What that means
is not that they weren't

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.386 align:middle line:84%
good the first time, but
the more they did it,

00:26:32.386 --> 00:26:33.219 align:middle line:90%
the better they got.

00:26:33.219 --> 00:26:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, practice
with anything.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you teach
people how to do this,

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.121 align:middle line:84%
you teach them how to basically
put people into a trance,

00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:42.244 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: I do.

00:26:42.244 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And what's funny is
is that, you know,

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.805 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- I
started hypnosis--

00:26:45.805 --> 00:26:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I did my first transcendental
meditation class when

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I was nine years old, did
my first hypnosis class

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.696 align:middle line:90%
when I was 12.

00:26:51.696 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:84%
My parents got me
into this stuff

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:57.015 align:middle line:84%
because it was-- it took
my parents-- my mother

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and my birth father, I took
their divorce rather hard

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.240 align:middle line:84%
when I was five, so they
were looking for ways

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:90%
to help me deal with things.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And, thank God, I kind of
matured into these techniques.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.376 align:middle line:84%
And when they first
sold hypnosis to me--

00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:10.500 align:middle line:84%
because as a kid, you got
to be sold things, right?

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: When they sold
it to me, they said,

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:84%
this will help you on stage--
because I was in some stage

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:84%
acting and stuff and
I really loved it--

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -and they said, this
will help your performance.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.675 align:middle line:90%
This will help your acting.

00:27:18.675 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, and I
kind of believed it.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:90%
But now I get it.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Now I know it.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Now I own it because I
matured into the technologies

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:90%
and now I've been teaching it.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And hypnosis has all
the weird connotations

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:90%
or the stigma that goes with it.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: But the
reality is, for me,

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
when you really
start to understand

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
what it is-- I mean, people
say, oh, I don't do hypnosis,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:90%
I just do guided imagery.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, essentially
it's the same thing.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it the same
thing as visualization?

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Yeah, but
we've got pictures.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:84%
You could be making
pictures of what you want,

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:84%
but you could have feelings of
poverty or lack in your body.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
You could have
negative self talk.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Deepak Chopra says that
the immune system is constantly

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.721 align:middle line:84%
eavesdropping on the internal
dialogue that occurs.

00:27:58.721 --> 00:27:59.595 align:middle line:90%
That's our self-talk.

00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:00.345 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:01.262 align:middle line:90%
That explains disease.

00:28:01.262 --> 00:28:02.344 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Absolutely true.

00:28:02.344 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that
there's much more going on

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:90%
than just dialogue.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.059 align:middle line:84%
You're making
pictures in your mind,

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:08.475 align:middle line:84%
you got feelings
in your mind, you

00:28:08.475 --> 00:28:09.849 align:middle line:84%
got sounds in your
mind and body,

00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
tastes and smells
to a lesser degree.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.229 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're
there, but they might

00:28:13.229 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:84%
have a lesser degree of impact
in terms of what you create.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So hypnosis removes
the critical faculty

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that gets in the way with
all those different pictures

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and images.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Well, what
it does is it allows

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:84%
you to get-- if we
think of our past,

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
because we all hear that we're
programmed and conditioned

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Getting rid of the
critical faculty

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.100 align:middle line:84%
allows us to get
into the programming

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and change the programming,
change the conditioning,

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
without having to bludgeon
it into submission after two

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:90%
or three years of affirmation.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So it is a fast
track and it is one

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of the quickest and lasting
ways to create change.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.195 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Absolutely.

00:28:44.195 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:90%
And the more--

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thus--

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -you do it,
the better you get.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- and when-- the
more you can learn about it.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.682 align:middle line:84%
I've-- you know, your
husband, John, was in the--

00:28:51.682 --> 00:28:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Audience, yeah.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.806 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: --the audience
of the program we just did.

00:28:54.806 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And he's a san soo master.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But you know it
better than I do.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Here I am telling you.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.765 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I say is that when

00:29:02.765 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:84%
you can get to the point
where you can remove

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:84%
your critical faculty at will
for selective suggestions,

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.333 align:middle line:90%
that's the black belt.

00:29:10.333 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: You know,
that's you want to get.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the mastery.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: That's the mastery.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Milton Erickson
said to clinicians--

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and he was just a magician
of change-- he said said,

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:84%
your patients will
be your patients

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
because they're out of rapport
with their unconscious minds.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.684 align:middle line:84%
And he saw his entire job
was putting them into rapport

00:29:26.684 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:84%
with themselves so that
they'd listen to themselves.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So when the captain,
the conscious mind,

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.163 align:middle line:84%
gave a command to the crew, the
crew would say, argh, captain,

00:29:34.163 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the captain giving
a command and having the 95%

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.775 align:middle line:84%
go everywhere but, which
is an unconscious mutiny.

00:29:41.775 --> 00:29:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mutiny.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.149 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Exactly.

00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:44.907 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
get in our own lives

00:29:44.907 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:84%
all the time, in our
relationships, in our health,

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.615 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves.

00:29:47.615 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.807 align:middle line:90%
So who wants to be like that?

00:29:49.807 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's get some rapport
going with ourselves.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Let's get
some rapport going

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:84%
with the unconscious
mind, but that's a process

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's a process as
a teaching process.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so, you
teach people how

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:90%
to help people through this.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And you've taught
so many things.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've done this
for, what, 20 years?

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Past 20 years, yeah.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As long
as I've known you.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.310 align:middle line:84%
We've known each
other that long.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.027 align:middle line:90%
It's weird, yeah.

00:30:06.027 --> 00:30:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you have
taught all over the world.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:84%
You've taught transformational
classes, courses,

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:90%
basis in neural linguistics.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Hypnosis, NLP.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.375 align:middle line:84%
We've built the largest NLP
training company in the world

00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:90%
in I'm proud to say that.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:84%
They built really
in Australia and all

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.190 align:middle line:90%
over-- all over the planet.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:84%
At one time, we had three
trainers teaching seminars

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:84%
at any given time in three
different places in the world.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: It's been
quite the journey.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: It's been fun.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.955 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then hundreds
of thousands of people

00:30:33.955 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
have gone through your
courses, which is wonderful,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.990 align:middle line:84%
because they've all
either been certified

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
in transformational
hypnosis, or in some type

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.520 align:middle line:84%
of neuro-linguistic programming
or something like that.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.630 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a little
clip here of Chris teaching

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest techniques
that I love about anchoring.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
This can be used in
any way in your life.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.996 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:30:53.996 --> 00:30:57.398 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:57.398 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.310 align:middle line:84%
-Hey, Chris Howard
here once again

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and welcome back
to beautiful Bali.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Ubud, Bali, the Indonesian
rainforest jungle paradise.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.510 align:middle line:90%
I love to say that that way.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, I've
got a question here

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've got to find it once
again because it was there.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, where did it go?

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Ah, here we go.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I have a certain
person in my family

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that really pushes
my buttons, and it

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
doesn't take long after seeing
them for me to get defensive

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:90%
and closed off.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I want us to be
able to communicate,

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.250 align:middle line:84%
but it seems
impossible sometimes.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:84%
What do you suggest to
help this relationship?

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to approach the
question from this perspective

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.310 align:middle line:84%
because you said this
person in your family

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:51.750 align:middle line:84%
really pushes your
buttons and it

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
doesn't take you long to get
defensive and closed off.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think the basic underlying
structure of what you're saying

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is that somebody else is
responsible for the way you

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.727 align:middle line:90%
feel about anything.

00:32:01.727 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the question
is, who's driving the bus?

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:07.430 align:middle line:90%
You're driving the bus.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.884 align:middle line:84%
You're in charge of your
states of mind and emotion.

00:32:09.884 --> 00:32:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
don't-- you know,

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:84%
most of the people in the world
don't look at it that way.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:84%
They think that their
states of mind and emotion

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.010 align:middle line:84%
are determined by the
weather, determined

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:22.350 align:middle line:84%
by the economy, the economic
times, is the thing up,

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.800 align:middle line:90%
is it down?

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's
happening outside of them.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And none of those
things are responsible

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:90%
for your emotional state.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, it's you.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.960 align:middle line:84%
If your emotions are
hinged on externals,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.650 align:middle line:84%
then you're in for an emotional
roller coaster ride of a life.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:84%
The only way to take charge
of your experience of life

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that you're
having the grandest expression

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.950 align:middle line:84%
of a life possible, is to take
charge of your own emotions,

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.690 align:middle line:84%
is to take responsibility
for your own emotions.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of
different techniques

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that we teach
throughout the trainings

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.690 align:middle line:84%
that we have at Rock
House for taking

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:90%
charge of your emotional states.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:04.430 align:middle line:84%
One very simple technique would
be an anchoring technique.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.990 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of anchoring
before based on Pavlov's work.

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.630 align:middle line:84%
When Ivan Pavlov
would feed his dogs,

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.830 align:middle line:84%
he'd sound a tuning
fork simultaneously.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.531 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't actually a bell.

00:33:14.531 --> 00:33:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But he'd sound that tuning fork
and the dogs would salivate.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.570 align:middle line:84%
They'd be in this
intense emotional state.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And so pretty soon, he'd sound
that tuning fork every time

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and because they were--
and here's the keys,

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:26.526 align:middle line:84%
this is what I want you
to remember from this.

00:33:26.526 --> 00:33:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the dogs were in an
intense-- the word is intense--

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:84%
emotional state and
simultaneously there

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.760 align:middle line:84%
was a unique stimulus, the two
became neurologically linked.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Became linked in the
dog's nervous system.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So pretty soon, all
he had to do was

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.023 align:middle line:84%
sound the tuning fork and
the dogs would salivate.

00:33:41.023 --> 00:33:44.096 align:middle line:84%
So am I saying that you're
going to sound a tuning fork

00:33:44.096 --> 00:33:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and your family member's
going to start salivating?

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.720 align:middle line:84%
This is about you and
this is about your state.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So the question is what
are some triggers, right?

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.090 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the dogs, the
trigger was the tuning fork.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.460 align:middle line:84%
What are some triggers that
you can set for yourself that

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.430 align:middle line:84%
will cause you to remember
intense states that are more

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:90%
empowering states for you?

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.990 align:middle line:84%
What's a state that you want
to be in in relationship

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:90%
to this family member?

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:90%
Is it a state of compassion?

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:10.551 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it a state of understanding,
and I don't know what it is.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's going
to be different

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.326 align:middle line:84%
depending upon the
situation, the individual,

00:34:18.326 --> 00:34:20.409 align:middle line:84%
so you're the one that has
to decide these things.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But what are the
states that you really

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.940 align:middle line:84%
want to bring into
that situation?

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that most people go
through life getting whatever

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.239 align:middle line:84%
they get emotionally,
and they're

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:84%
at the whim of everything
else that happens to them.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'm suggesting
is rather than

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.964 align:middle line:84%
do that, you go into
situations by design.

00:34:38.964 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:84%
That you go into these
situations and you think, OK,

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:42.770 align:middle line:84%
what are the emotional
states that I'm

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.500 align:middle line:84%
going to bring into
this situation?

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Now one thing to remember is
that when you are in any given

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.750 align:middle line:84%
situation, in interpersonal
communication the person

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:84%
who's most committed
to their state

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:84%
will end up drawing the
other person into that state.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So if this family
member is more committed

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:02.606 align:middle line:84%
to whatever emotional state
they're in, whether it be--

00:35:02.606 --> 00:35:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what they're
doing to push your buttons,

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:84%
so you say, but maybe
they're irritated

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:90%
or they're agitated in some way.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they're more
committed to that

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.030 align:middle line:84%
than you are to the states that
you're going to go in with,

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.772 align:middle line:84%
like a state of compassion
or a state of love.

00:35:18.772 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:84%
If they're more
committed to their state,

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
pull you in, right?

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're committed more to
your state, on the other hand,

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
pull them in, right?

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's the key
is first deciding

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.550 align:middle line:84%
what emotional
states do you want

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:84%
to be in when you go
into that situation?

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Write down three or four
different empowering states.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And then when I say come
up with some triggers that

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.110 align:middle line:84%
can trigger those states off,
maybe what you want to do

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:84%
is just reconditioning
the old triggers.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:90%
That's a good way to go.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can do this through
visual guided imagery, right?

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Now it's a complex process.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.430 align:middle line:84%
We teach all sorts of
different ways to do this.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you the
down and dirty quick way

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to reprogram or recondition
those anchors that you

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:90%
have that fire off.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So one way would
be, first of all, we

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.620 align:middle line:84%
need to collect those
emotional states.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So whatever emotional
states you write down,

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.180 align:middle line:84%
let's say it's compassion, it's
love, and it's understanding.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Then I want you to write
down three or four events

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.820 align:middle line:84%
in your past for
each one of those

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.250 align:middle line:84%
where you felt those
emotional states.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So write down three or
four events from your past

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
for each one of those where you
felt those emotional states.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Step one, identify the states.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Step two, write down three
or four events from your past

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:90%
where you felt those states.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Step three, go back into those
incidents, like in your mind,

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.250 align:middle line:90%
it's a journey of consciousness.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But all of your problems
are problems of imagination,

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and all of your solutions
are solutions of imagination.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
go back and you're

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.270 align:middle line:84%
going to step into your
body so you're right

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.880 align:middle line:84%
inside those events, so you're
looking through your own eyes,

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.296 align:middle line:84%
hearing what you
heard at the time

00:36:48.296 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:90%
and feeling those feelings.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
collect those states

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.996 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to begin to
practice feeling those states.

00:36:54.996 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:84%
We have a technique
that's called

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.592 align:middle line:84%
stacking that we teach also
in some of our trainings,

00:36:58.592 --> 00:37:01.050 align:middle line:84%
where you can go back and you
can stack one of those states

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.460 align:middle line:84%
on top of another
on top of another

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.584 align:middle line:84%
so you could be feeling
three or four those states.

00:37:04.584 --> 00:37:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So you could be
feeling compassionate

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:90%
and loving at the same time.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
healthily detached,

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.060 align:middle line:84%
might be a good state to
bring in there, too, right?

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So where you're feeling
all of those things, right?

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.160 align:middle line:90%
So you can stack those.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.080 align:middle line:84%
The way that you do it
is you feel one state,

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.310 align:middle line:84%
you go into another
event with another state

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and then you just imagine
stacking that state

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.440 align:middle line:90%
on top of the first one.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you can do the same
thing with the third one.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get better
at layering these states

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.975 align:middle line:84%
Once you've done all
of that, then you

00:37:35.975 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:84%
can come back to
the here and now

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and then just do guided imagery
and do visual rehearsal.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself going into
situations with this person

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.350 align:middle line:84%
where they do whatever they
did that fired off those-- that

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.330 align:middle line:84%
pushed those buttons, right,
where they did whatever they

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:52.410 align:middle line:84%
did, but instead imagine
going into those situations

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:90%
with these emotional states.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And notice how easy
it is and how it flows

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.740 align:middle line:90%
and how you go through it.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
world around us

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.195 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but a projection
of our consciousness.

00:38:03.195 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that
people in our lives

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:84%
can't behave in any way
in relationship with us

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.740 align:middle line:84%
other than the way we
project them to behave.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Phil says we teach people
how to treat us, right?

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So the way that you
show up absolutely

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.091 align:middle line:84%
can and will change the
behaviors of the people

00:38:20.091 --> 00:38:20.590 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
You just got to be committed
to it and go into it.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.920 align:middle line:90%
So create it with design.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And remember, if you need
any help with anything that's

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.330 align:middle line:84%
going on, always feel
free to reach out

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to our support at
support@rockhouseglobal.com.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, love
deeply, shine brightly,

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.100 align:middle line:84%
make every day an
extraordinary adventure.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So where was that shot?

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: That was in Bali.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful Bali.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:90%
How did you wind up there?

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.822 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: One of the most
beautiful places on the planet.

00:38:56.822 --> 00:38:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it one
of your favorites?

00:38:58.090 --> 00:38:59.381 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Oh, it absolutely is.

00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Like I tell people, it's the
heart of the soul of the world.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:90%
It's just a magical place.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.205 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:39:06.205 --> 00:39:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:84%
How did I-- that's
an interesting story.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.335 align:middle line:84%
But we built a large
training organization.

00:39:11.335 --> 00:39:14.030 align:middle line:84%
We'd done $100 million
in global sales

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and we were doing seminars
all over the planet.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was in two different time
zones every week and flying.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:84%
We had 6,000 people
the first time

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.830 align:middle line:84%
we went to London and 2,000
or 3,000 people every weekend

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:84%
kept flooding in to
learn this stuff,

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.470 align:middle line:84%
because it is powerful
transformational technology.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.865 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It works.

00:39:29.865 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And I think that
there's a wave that's sweeping

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:34.001 align:middle line:84%
around the planet right now of
more and more people waking up

00:39:34.001 --> 00:39:35.902 align:middle line:84%
to the whole mind-body
connection and the--

00:39:35.902 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: -quantum
mechanical nature

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:41.200 align:middle line:90%
of the human being in reality.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And that comes down
to subjectivity,

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that life is subjective.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.890 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics
they say the atom

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist as anything
other than a probability

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.810 align:middle line:90%
until you look for it to exist.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And in looking for it to exist,
you bring it into existence.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:54.800 align:middle line:90%
So our world is subjective.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:84%
That means that when
we change ourselves,

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.750 align:middle line:84%
when we change the observer, we
change that which is observed.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.310 align:middle line:90%
We change the world around us.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.060 align:middle line:90%
So people are flooding in.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.002 align:middle line:84%
So we had so many
people flooding in

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that I was teaching
programs all over the place

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.602 align:middle line:90%
and I did too much.

00:40:09.602 --> 00:40:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.851 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:10.851 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: At the end, it became
like "Weekend at Bernie's,"

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.865 align:middle line:84%
where they were wheeling
me out on the stage.

00:40:14.865 --> 00:40:16.198 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I can't do this.

00:40:16.198 --> 00:40:17.739 align:middle line:90%
Please, stop, right?

00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how Tony
Robbins and those guys

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:90%
put on that kind of a pace.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.006 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:23.006 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: It's tough.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a lot.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And people like Tony is a
magician of change as well.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.166 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And he comes
from an LP background.

00:40:31.166 --> 00:40:33.656 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that I
think Tony is probably

00:40:33.656 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot like myself
in this regard.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.568 align:middle line:84%
That I can't imagine giving
less than 100% to the people

00:40:38.568 --> 00:40:39.160 align:middle line:90%
that I'm with.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: I just
can't imagine it.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.958 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know that
about you, yes.

00:40:41.958 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: I pour 100%
of myself into it.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.322 align:middle line:84%
So the schedule got to be very
intense and a lot of players

00:40:48.322 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:90%
involved in this stuff.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And finally I popped,
I'm like you know what?

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though I love
what I do-- and I do.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I still love what I do, I
love doing this with you,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I love being with the
audiences and stuff,

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.321 align:middle line:90%
but I needed time out!

00:40:59.321 --> 00:40:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Time out!

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, you need to
practice what you preach.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: I remember
a couple years

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:84%
before, I was sitting with
Richard Branson on Necker

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Island, as you do, right?

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, right.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: As you do.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.483 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nope, haven't done that.

00:41:10.483 --> 00:41:12.454 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: But I
just got fortunate.

00:41:12.454 --> 00:41:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I was out there, he was
there at the same time

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:90%
and we had a conversation.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how do
you handle the stress?

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And he said something
really interesting to me.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:20.828 align:middle line:90%
He said, you know what?

00:41:20.828 --> 00:41:22.630 align:middle line:90%
He says, I have no stress.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Now when I heard him say
that, I couldn't hear him.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-uh.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Because we each have
our unique model of the world

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and mine had stress in it.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.546 align:middle line:90%
His, according to him, didn't.

00:41:32.546 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't hear him, nor
did I believe it at the time.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I was like, come on,
talk to me about this.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.164 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, first
of all I work out,

00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and he said, and that helps.

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but
secondly, there's

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.193 align:middle line:84%
nothing that could happen
to me in business that's

00:41:44.193 --> 00:41:46.330 align:middle line:84%
worth worrying about,
which tells you something

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:47.920 align:middle line:84%
about his values,
tells you something

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.870 align:middle line:90%
about what's really important.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, if there
was something that

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.295 align:middle line:84%
was to happen to either
my health or the health

00:41:54.295 --> 00:41:56.540 align:middle line:84%
of somebody in my family,
that would be a problem.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing that could
happen to me in business.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And I know you had
direct experiences

00:41:59.360 --> 00:41:59.780 align:middle line:90%
with things like that.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: He said,
there's nothing

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.400 align:middle line:84%
that could happen
to me in business

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.150 align:middle line:90%
that's worth worrying about.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.295 align:middle line:84%
He said, if the
Virgin companies were

00:42:04.295 --> 00:42:06.150 align:middle line:84%
to fall out from
underneath me today,

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I go move to Bali or something.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.267 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you went to Bali.

00:42:09.267 --> 00:42:09.891 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:11.860 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is, I
had been seeing pictures

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:84%
from Bali, because I used to
work in Club Med in the hotel

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
resort industry and I saw
pictures of this paradise.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.160 align:middle line:90%
You know, like--

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of course, the
huts and everything.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.184 align:middle line:84%
They have a resort out
there and I had always

00:42:21.184 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go anyway and
I heard him say that.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to this point
where I just desperately needed

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:28.769 align:middle line:84%
a break, and I had
a hostile takeover

00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:29.810 align:middle line:90%
with my business partner.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:31.935 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of weird stuff
happened with the company.

00:42:31.935 --> 00:42:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It was like, OK, I'm stepping
out and I packed my bags

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.170 align:middle line:90%
and I went to Bali.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.836 align:middle line:90%
And I grew my hair long.

00:42:37.836 --> 00:42:39.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, all my
shots everywhere

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.180 align:middle line:84%
you see short hair on
the book, and it's like,

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I grew my hair long-- the
jury's still out on it,

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:46.820 align:middle line:84%
but I grew it long and
I'm riding my motorcycle

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.490 align:middle line:84%
through the rainforests and
just connecting, just being.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Letting go.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Not caring.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Letting go.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And you really do realize
what's really important.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.082 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
Walt Disney said,

00:42:58.082 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:84%
we don't make movies
to make money,

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.770 align:middle line:90%
we make money to make movies.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.228 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what's
really important?

00:43:02.228 --> 00:43:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Well, for me, like--
and, you ask me tomorrow,

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.910 align:middle line:90%
ask me in another 100 years.

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It changes from time to time.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.731 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: But I think
for each of us--

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Viktor Frankl wrote his book
"Man's Search For Meaning"

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.904 align:middle line:84%
and he said we're all looking
to have meaning in our life,

00:43:17.904 --> 00:43:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and we need to have-- you know,
people that live in states

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.600 align:middle line:84%
of chronic depression and
things like that is oftentimes

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have a greater

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:24.870 align:middle line:84%
meaning to their
experience of life.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:25.411 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:43:25.411 --> 00:43:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And for me,
up until that time,

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:90%
my meaning was the mission.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Pursuing the mission and
making a global difference,

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and then eradicating
poverty on a larger level.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I was
on this big mission.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.517 align:middle line:84%
But I poured so much of
myself into that mission

00:43:39.517 --> 00:43:40.850 align:middle line:90%
that I was like a shooting star.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So it was like when I
got back out to Bali,

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I got to discover myself and
my relationship with myself.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like-- OK,
so I went through this phase

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.420 align:middle line:84%
where I was like, OK, I'm
what's really important.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.295 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like--

00:43:50.295 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very good, yes.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.251 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Yeah, it's
like-- because nothing

00:43:53.251 --> 00:43:57.530 align:middle line:84%
exists without me because who
knows what happens when we go.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So all I wanted to do was
enjoy myself and just have fun.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.010 align:middle line:84%
But then there was this
burning inside of me

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.950 align:middle line:84%
again to get back out and it's
like, OK, I'm going to do this

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.740 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to do
it in a different way.

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do it in
respecting myself and taking

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.800 align:middle line:84%
care of myself along
the way, not being

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.610 align:middle line:84%
a martyr for the cause,
but building in a way.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.069 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's--
it's maturing.

00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.568 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:44:19.568 --> 00:44:21.360 align:middle line:84%

>>HOWARD: Yeah.

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And people have been
telling me that lately.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.575 align:middle line:84%
They're coming up to me like,
oh my God, to watch the grace

00:44:31.575 --> 00:44:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and elegance that you
came through this with.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.780 align:middle line:84%
If only they knew behind
closed doors, right?

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you were just
recently doing another class

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:42.030 align:middle line:84%
here in Los Angeles and we
have another video clip.

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And tell us a little
bit about what this is?

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: So this is actually
a pain control demonstration

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that I did just
this past weekend.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And in this, I use
a rapid induction,

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.300 align:middle line:90%
which looks actually very harsh.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It looks like I'm karate
chopping her on the neck.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.638 align:middle line:84%
But it actually goes-- so
it's a rapid induction that

00:44:59.638 --> 00:45:01.730 align:middle line:84%
takes her very, very
deep very quick.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But she will rate her pain
on a scale from zero to 100.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.400 align:middle line:84%
She'll have a certain
amount of pain

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and then that pain
will dissipate

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.120 align:middle line:84%
after we do the
induction in the process.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is is
that with pain control,

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I did that all
across North America,

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:15.790 align:middle line:84%
taught it for years
and years and years,

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and hypnosis is one
most phenomenal methods

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever seen
for pain control.

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.905 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's beautiful
because there are so

00:45:22.905 --> 00:45:25.324 align:middle line:84%
many people in pain,
especially back pain.

00:45:25.324 --> 00:45:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look at this clip.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.684 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:45:27.684 --> 00:45:28.350 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:31.900 align:middle line:84%
-And you're going to
push down on my hand.

And as you push down

I want your eyes

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Hard, hard, one.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:54.960 align:middle line:90%

Close your eyes.

00:45:59.112 --> 00:46:00.573 align:middle line:90%
Four, double it.

00:46:00.573 --> 00:46:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Five, double it.

wondrous winter wonderland.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.198 align:middle line:90%
Your breath is there.

00:46:35.198 --> 00:46:38.607 align:middle line:84%
You're bundled up nice
and warm so it feels good.

00:46:38.607 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:84%
If that right hand was
completely anesthetized now,

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:47.164 align:middle line:84%
what's the color of that
anesthesia in that right hand?

00:46:47.164 --> 00:46:48.601 align:middle line:90%
Imagine if it had a color.

00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:51.516 align:middle line:90%
Imagine if it made a sound.

00:46:51.516 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And imagine a feeling
of anesthesia.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to begin to
flow a river of anesthesia

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.730 align:middle line:84%
from your right hand all the way
up your right arm, all the way

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:06.220 align:middle line:84%
over to your back to that area
where you require healing.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Allowing the river of
anesthesia to continue

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:13.095 align:middle line:84%
to flow to your back to that
area where you require healing.

00:47:13.095 --> 00:47:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Your lower back, all the
way down through the leg,

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:84%
wherever it is that
you require healing.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the color and
the sound and the feeling

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of anesthesia flowing down
to that area, saturating it.

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.440 align:middle line:84%
You'll find it easy to
respond while remaining deeply

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.640 align:middle line:84%
in trance, on a scale
from zero to 100

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.400 align:middle line:90%
right now, where are you now?

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.170 align:middle line:90%


00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:37.700 align:middle line:90%
-40.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.585 align:middle line:90%
-40.

00:47:38.585 --> 00:47:39.084 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:47:39.084 --> 00:47:41.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the perfect number.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I want you to continue to
flow that river of anesthesia.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.680 align:middle line:90%
It's faster than a Tylenol.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Continue to flow that
river of anesthesia

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.440 align:middle line:84%
from the right hand
down to that area,

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.237 align:middle line:84%
completely
anesthetizing that area.

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:55.195 align:middle line:84%
Imagining the color, the
sound, and the feeling

00:47:55.195 --> 00:47:57.470 align:middle line:84%
of that anesthesia
down there in those--

00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:59.283 align:middle line:84%
wherever it is that
you require healing.

00:47:59.283 --> 00:48:00.270 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was
absolutely magnificent.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.380 align:middle line:84%
People were talking
about that all weekend,

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.200 align:middle line:90%
so it's very powerful process.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And did you check back
in with her the next day?

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:08.908 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: We did.

00:48:08.908 --> 00:48:11.959 align:middle line:84%
So the pain had
gone down even more.

00:48:11.959 --> 00:48:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Like I think she was
at a two the next day,

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and she had been
at an 80 before.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.584 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:48:16.584 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: Yeah, but
that's not uncommon.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would get that all the
time where people I would work

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.176 align:middle line:84%
pain control with them and
years later they'd come up to me

00:48:23.176 --> 00:48:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know, I never
had pain again in my body.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It carries
over that long?

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD: Not every time.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.793 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it becomes more of
a thing of pain management.

00:48:29.793 --> 00:48:30.540 align:middle line:90%
It just depends.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's just one example
of what we're capable of.

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.221 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And I think that's
the real important message here,

00:48:37.221 --> 00:48:40.464 align:middle line:84%
is not that we can put
somebody in a rapid trance

00:48:40.464 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:84%
so they can get
rid of their pain.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.730 align:middle line:84%
But if they can do that,
what else can they do?

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.530 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: What else
are we capable of?

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:46.820 align:middle line:90%
People play small in life.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We're capable of so much
more than we give ourselves

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:49.160 align:middle line:90%
credit for.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:49.659 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:49.659 --> 00:48:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD: And when
we learn how to tap

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:55.170 align:middle line:84%
into the power of
100% of who we are,

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.660 align:middle line:84%
we can live the lives that
we're really meant to live.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.830 align:middle line:84%
We can live the highest
expression of a life

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.627 align:middle line:84%
that we possibly
could live, and that's

00:49:01.627 --> 00:49:02.960 align:middle line:90%
why this stuff has been so cool.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Shows the beautiful
power of our minds.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Chris
Howard, for joining me.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.840 align:middle line:90%

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.710 align:middle line:90%
