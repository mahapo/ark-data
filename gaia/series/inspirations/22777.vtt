00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello, and welcome.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Are you finding yourself
stuck in a rut in a job

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.310 align:middle line:84%
where you're feeling
you've lost your purpose

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:90%
or you've lost your passion?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to find out the
optimal pattern for your body

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and for your mind otherwise
known as your purpose?

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to wake up
filled with anticipation

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
of the adventures of the
day and grab that day?

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is Jean Houston.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:84%
She's an author of 26 books, a
leader in the Human Potential

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Movement.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Jean has spent nearly
50 years consulting

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:84%
with heads of states, indigenous
people, US presidents, CEOs,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and luminaries respected
around the globe.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.290 align:middle line:84%
She is one of the most highly
respected teachers in the Human

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Development Movement,
and she's here

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
to help us step outside
of that daily grind

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:84%
so that we can stop
living solely for survival

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and start living with passion,
with purpose, with peace.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.644 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show, Jean.

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:15.309 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN HOUSTON: Well,
thank you so much.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I hope I can live up
to that introduction.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.116 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To all that
I just said there.

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I
was sharing earlier

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I have so much honor and
so much respect for you,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and I am so grateful for you
being here because of who

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
you are and who you represent
to so many of us as a model.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate you being there.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about big topics
like the Human Potential

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Movement-- the possible human.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean by
the possible human?

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, the
possible human, Lisa,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
is a beingness that resides
in every human being

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
beneath the surface
crust of consciousness.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.322 align:middle line:84%
We are so much more
than we pretend to be.

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wait, how
do you know that?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.029 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: We are so much
more than what eyes can see.

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I've had
thousands of research

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
subjects-- perhaps several
million seminar participants.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I am often, because of the
nature of my life and work,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I am thrown into situations of
often very difficult challenges

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
where one really has to
evoke, call forth, ignite

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the human passion, the human
possibility, the human capacity

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
in order to deal with the
complexity of our time.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Because let's face
it, we are living

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
in what is the most interesting,
challenging, awesome time

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've called it
the most critical time.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: It is that, too.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, other times in
history thought they were it.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.323 align:middle line:90%
They're wrong.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:36.885 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:37.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Why is this--

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.283 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, look what
could happen in our lifetime.

00:02:40.283 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we see what is
happening with the ecology

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and the global
warming, and the fact

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:84%
that within a pretty
short period of time

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
it is quite possible
that 40% of the cities--

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:84%
well, 40% of the major cities
of the world are on coastlines.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Those oceans rise
from global warming.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
You can see what's
happening-- huge migrations.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
We see what is
happening not just

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
with the climate on
many other levels

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
but the inner climate
where most of us

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
were prepared for a
very different world.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
The world that I grew up in was
a very, very, very different

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.072 align:middle line:84%
world from the world
I live in today.

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:16.905 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what way?

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:17.405 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, in fact
that we had certain jobs.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
We knew that we would have the
jobs for the rest of our life,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and that we would get a
pension, and, and, and.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was a kind of--
kind of natural grace

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:84%
of expectation, and all
of that is gone now.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There was certainty.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: There was certainty.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is something
we are lacking, yes.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.123 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: We knew who
we were in community.

00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:90%
We knew who we were.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:90%
The old story worked.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, we are not quite sure.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:90%
We're in tremendous transition.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did we really, though?

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Did we really know who we were?

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well,
we knew who we were

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:90%
within the context of the time.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:90%
And now the context has changed.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there has been
probably more changes

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
from the time of, say, the
birth of Christ to about 1950 as

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:90%
between 1950 and today.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's the level of change.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.725 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:07.474 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: We've not
been prepared for it.

00:04:07.474 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that the
human capacity is so vast,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and it takes this kind of
incredible acceleration

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:90%
of events and of time and space.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
Space is shrinking,
time is warping,

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and we are being called to tap
into these immense resources

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
which we did not need
during the millennium.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
The millennium-- the
thousands of years

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.905 align:middle line:84%
in which we led what we
might call the expected life.

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great term.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:90%
You're so great with terms.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Take us back to your childhood
where you met your mentor.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
As you are a mentor
to so many now,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
you had someone who
ignited you who turned--

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Well, I had several.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Who's the one
you're thinking of?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.671 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: de Chardin.

00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:52.639 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Oh, right.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:90%
You want the whole story?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.395 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: It's a dilly.

00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tell me.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, yes.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.013 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: OK.

00:04:56.013 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:90%
So I'm 14 years old.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.252 align:middle line:84%
I'm this great big
overgrown girl.

00:04:59.252 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I have just found
out that my parents

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
are getting divorced.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Whoa-- I was sunk into grief,
and I couldn't get out of it.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had had a wonderful
time with my parents.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I went to 20 schools
before I was 12.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
My father was a comedy writer
and wrote the comedy shows,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
so we were always on the road
and we had marvelous times.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So I was so stunned
and in such grief.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And some kid in my
school said, hey,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I hear that if you run you
can run away from your grief.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.876 align:middle line:90%
I said, what a good idea.

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: I
wouldn't do that now.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wise advice.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Wise kid.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.667 align:middle line:90%
So I ran down Park Avenue.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Run, run, run.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:90%
I was running late for school.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:90%
And I ran into an old man.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And I knocked the
wind out of him.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And I picked him
up off the ground,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and he was laughing
and laughing.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said, where
are you going?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm--
I'm going to school.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going-- he said,
but you-- you know.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:84%
He was clearly in a
life of great adventure.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, you really think so?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.792 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes, he said.

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, bon voyage.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:90%
I said, bon voyage.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And I ran off to school.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Following week, I meet
the old man again.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And this time I
have my dog, who's

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.082 align:middle line:90%
a Fox Terrier named Champ.

00:06:10.082 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, ah, my
friend, the runner,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:90%
and you have a Fox Terrier.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.399 align:middle line:84%
I knew one many
years ago in France.

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, where
are you going now?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm-- I'm, I'm
going to Central Park with

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.337 align:middle line:90%
my dog to think about things.

00:06:23.337 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I will go with you sometime.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.169 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I will take my constitutional,
he said in his French accent.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And he had a long
name-- French name--

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:84%
but he asked me to call him
by the first part of it, which

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.312 align:middle line:84%
to my American ears
sounded like "Mr. Tay-er."

00:06:38.312 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: "Tay-er?"

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: "Mr. Tay-er."

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Tayer and I began
to have these meetings that

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
lasted off and on for the next--
actually, when I really came

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
down, nearly three years.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As a teenager.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.081 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: As a teenager.

00:06:52.081 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:90%
I was 14 when it started.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So we would take these
walks, and he was something.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, he had no self
consciousness at all.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
He would suddenly fall
to his knees on the grass

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.381 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh look, a caterpillar.

00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Ummm.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Little tiny feet.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Little, little,
beautiful, little spots.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Ah, hey, Jean, can you feel
yourself to be a caterpillar?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, very
easily, Mr. Tayer.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Here I was, 14
years old, 5' 11",

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:84%
probably had some
red dots on my face.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:90%
I felt like a caterpillar.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, what are
you when you finally

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:90%
become un papillon, a butterfly?

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't know Mr.--

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you don't-- no.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:90%
No, you do know.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:90%
What is the butterfly of Jean?

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I think when I become
a papillon-- a butterfly--

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.132 align:middle line:84%
I'll, I'll, I'll fly all over
the earth and help people.

00:07:42.132 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Jean, sniff the wind.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.016 align:middle line:84%
Same wind was sniffed
by Jesus Christ.

00:07:48.016 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, Jesus Christ
sniffed this wind?

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.392 align:middle line:90%
I better hold my breath.

00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And then he went, Alexandre
le Grand, Jeanne d'Arc,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Marie Antoinette-
there were a lot

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:84%
of French people in
the wind, I noticed.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Genghis Khan, not so good.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Be filled with the
tides of history.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Be filled with Joan of Arc.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was incredible.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Jean, Jean, look-- God's
calligraphy in the sky.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:90%
You know, in the clouds.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And everything was filled
with magic and wonder.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:90%
And he would talk to things.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
He would talk to the
stones in Central Park.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my friend, the mica
schist layer, do you remember?

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So we had these-- this
tremendous time and--

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And as a teenager who
was going through a dark time--

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, I wasn't
going through-- yeah,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.918 align:middle line:84%
I was going through
that dark time.

00:08:32.918 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
But he lifted-- he gave me
books to read, to think about.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Alfred North Whitehead's
"Adventures and Ideas."

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Lecomte du Nuoy's
"Human Destiny."

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And one day I said to him,
Um, Mr. Tayer, you know,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
at school we talk about the
H-bomb and whether we're-- I

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
don't know I'm ever
going to get to be 21.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, you talk about
destiny all the time.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Jean, yes, we
are with the destiny.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
It is as if we are moving
towards a noosphere--

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
the field of mind when we
will be interconnected.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And the world mind will be
taking a walk with itself,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and it is then that we will
get into the higher destiny

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.584 align:middle line:84%
that the God has
prepared for us.

00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had these
tremendous conversations.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you ever go
back to your peers and say,

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:90%
the noosphere, the noosphere.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:90%
There's this man--

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: I did.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
The noo-as-what did
you say, Jeannie?

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.775 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Anyway, we had
this-- he really-- you know,

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
he saw me, but he also embedded
me in the cosmic story.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
We went to-- and
this is something

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I've never written about-- we
went to the 64th Street Central

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Park.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And we started
looking at-- what was

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.804 align:middle line:84%
it-- some kind of little
bloop, bloop, bloop.

00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Bubbles?

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: A kind of bubble
type of fishy type of thing.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And then we went on to fish.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And then he took me to the
fish and the aquariums.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:90%
And then we looked at bugs.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we looked--
we went all way up,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and you know, primitive
beings, and then

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.420 align:middle line:84%
the monkeys and
the higher monkeys,

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:90%
and then the human beings.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we ended
looking at a baby.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, that is the
tomorrow's child.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:90%
That is the future of evolution.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.082 align:middle line:84%
It was that kind of learning
that meant so much--

00:10:14.082 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you can't
get that at school.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: --so much to me.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And it turned me on.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.919 align:middle line:84%
Then it was my first
year in college.

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:90%
I was at Barnard College.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.173 align:middle line:90%
It was April 7.

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:29.672 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:29.672 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:90%
What a memory.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And I was
talking with him,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:90%
and he seemed very wan and pale.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And he talked-- and
I gave him the-- it

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:90%
was the shell of a snail.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, escargot.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And he began to talk about
the great spirals of creation

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.494 align:middle line:84%
that's in the brain and
in the intestinal tract--

00:10:49.494 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And he
relates it to the--

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: --and in the
galaxies and the whorl pattern

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:90%
of flowers.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it is all a
great spiral of becoming.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And he went-- he waxed
ecstatic for probably

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:90%
the better part of 20 minutes.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Until finally he said,
omega, omega, omega.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The deep things that
are calling forth

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
are unfolding of
our possibilities

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and of all of
reality into spirit.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was he who
we believe said it,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:84%
we are not just human beings
having a spiritual experience;

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
we are spiritual beings
having a human experience.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So I said-- he said,
au revoir, Jean.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:90%
I said, au revoir, Mr. Tayer.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you on Tuesday.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
We often met Tuesdays and
Thursdays when he was around.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.284 align:middle line:84%
And Champ, my dog,
did not want to go.

00:11:44.284 --> 00:11:45.492 align:middle line:90%
And Champ went, [WHIMPERING].

00:11:45.492 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.705 align:middle line:90%
Come on, Champ.

00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:51.032 align:middle line:90%
Come on. [WHIMPERING].

00:11:51.032 --> 00:11:51.615 align:middle line:90%
Please, Champ.

00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And Champ just dragged,
but finally went along.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Next Tuesday, I was waiting in
the same place we always met.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Because he lived,
actually, catacorner to me.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Not at that time, but most
of that period of time.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
He lived at 83rd,
84th and Park Avenue.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I lived at 86th
off of Park Avenue.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And we waited and waited,
and he didn't come.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And the following
Thursday, I waited.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And Tuesday, Thursday--
to eight weeks I waited.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:90%
He never came.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.220 align:middle line:84%
He had died that Easter
Sunday, April 10th,

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:90%
and I did not know it.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Years later I was
in graduate school,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and someone gave me a
book without a cover

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:90%
called, "The Phenomenon of Man."

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:90%
And I read it.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was too familiar--
noosphere, metamorphosis--

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and I said to my friend, do you
have-- do you have the cover?

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And she pulled it out
from underneath a big pile

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:90%
of The New York Times.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And I flipped it over, and there
was no forgetting that face.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Tayer had been Pierre
Teilhard de Chardin--

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.637 align:middle line:90%
the great, great--

00:12:54.637 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Philosopher.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: --mystic,
philosopher, paleontologist.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the great luminous
minds of the 20th century.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you never
knew at the time.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:90%
You never--

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And a lot of people
did not know at the time.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
It was only after he died
that a Mademoiselle Jeanne

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Mortier, who had the
rights to his work,

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:90%
published his great works.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you were
able to connect to that.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So how did you take
that experience

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and then go on to
become a teacher?

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel that that
was an experience that

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.569 align:middle line:90%
happened to you for a reason?

00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: What a
wonderful question.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it did.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I went on within-- by
the time I was 20, 21,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching at Columbia.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: But the point,
I guess, I was 21-- 21,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
22-- yeah, about that, and I
remember the way he taught me.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:90%
It was all experiential.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember watching-- we
were watching a very old woman

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:90%
watch a little boy play a game.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And he went up to
her-- Madame, why

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
you seem so fascinated
by the game?

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, it's because I played
a game like that in Central

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.404 align:middle line:84%
Park in 1885, but it's
a might different.

00:14:03.404 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And he goes to the
little boy, would you

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
like to see how it was
played so many years ago?

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.924 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:14:09.924 --> 00:14:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is Central
Park, New York City.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And he would just
put people together.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And so this has been part
of my life-- experience,

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:84%
experiential, really making--
having deep and complex

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and evocative concepts--

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:22.954 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Conversations, yes.

00:14:22.954 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: --and then
making them hands-on,

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:84%
sensory-rich, letting
people feel them,

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.234 align:middle line:84%
experience them, incarnate
them, become them.

00:14:30.234 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is what
I was saying earlier.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:84%
That is why I so appreciate
your embodiment of all of this.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Now to hear your stories and
how you started off with this.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have a goal to
say I want to be a teacher,

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a business
owner or whatnot,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
or have you always lived your
life in this full richness

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and what has come out of it?

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I had a sense when
I was very, very young--

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:84%
so young, maybe two,
three years old--

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.044 align:middle line:90%
that there was lots to do here.

00:15:03.044 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.394 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: I had a big job.

00:15:05.394 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I had that
from the very start.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, then,
getting the experience

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
before I was 11, 12
years old of being

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:84%
able to travel through
America at a time

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that if you went to school
in Biloxi, Mississippi one

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:84%
day and Bemidji,
Minnesota two days later,

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
you were in totally
different realities.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Different lands.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Actually,
as radical as being

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.771 align:middle line:84%
in an island off of Greece
and then being in Norway.

00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that's how
different it was.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So your-- by
the way, your travels

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
took you to vast places
where you started

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
to get into the
roots of the people

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and really help the
people where you would go.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.594 align:middle line:84%
And then you found yourself
conversing with heads of state.

00:15:47.594 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, you jumped
about 30 years, but yes.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.135 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I
know, but you went

00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:84%
from these-- so what took
you on your initial travels

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:90%
to outside of the country?

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: What took me?

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, initially,
I wanted to see the world,

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.479 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
But then Margaret Mead became--
the great anthropologist--

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:84%
became a very,
very close friend.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I became
her second daughter--

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:84%
the adopted daughter-- and she
lived with my husband and I

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:84%
off and on for the last
six years of her life.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Jean, I want you
to harvest the human potential.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing it
in the laboratory,

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and now I want you to
do it around the world.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.099 align:middle line:84%
Go around these-- I'm
going to write you letters

00:16:27.099 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:84%
of introduction to people who
will be important to help you

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.250 align:middle line:84%
introduce you into
their cultures.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Find out.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Find out why this
tribe in Africa-

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:84%
this particular tribe in West
Africa, it was towards West--

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
has no history of warfare
as we understand it

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.171 align:middle line:84%
and no neurosis as
we understand it.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So she sent me off there, and
I lived with them for a while.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.495 align:middle line:84%
And, indeed, I found out they
thought in very different ways.

00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what ways?

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well,
for example, there

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:90%
was a problem around sanitation.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:84%
They all got together
with the drums-- music--

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and they danced it with
that great chicken dance.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And they drummed it.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from little tiny
children to the elders,

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:90%
and they danced it.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And then they sang it.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And that wonderful
back and forth.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.496 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING]

00:17:14.496 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And the
drumming and the dancing,

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.266 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
incarnating the problem.

00:17:18.266 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
And they drew it, and they
talked a little bit about it.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:90%
And they danced it some more.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And then they had a
tremendous solution.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing?

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:84%
They were cooking
on more burners.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
They were using
more of themselves.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that gave me a huge
revelation that we cannot live

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
as encapsulated bags of skin
dragging around our dreary,

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:90%
little egos.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
We literally have to use so
much more of this immensity

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:90%
that we have been given.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.105 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you weave
that into teaching people--

00:17:46.105 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Teaching people
how to do these things, yes.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.994 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --how to do--

00:17:48.994 --> 00:17:51.344 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: She sent me to
Bali to finish up-- well,

00:17:51.344 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
was finishing up

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
her work-- but in the
villages in which she worked

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and taking pictures
of the people

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
that she had known as babies
who were now in their 30s

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, 40s, I guess.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Jean, find out
why so many of them are artists.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:90%
75% are artists.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:84%
They might also be textile
designers or cooks,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:90%
but they are also artists--

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.836 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In Bali.

00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: --or rice farmers.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And I watched this culture.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I watched the way they would
learn things very differently

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:90%
from the way we learned.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
They would pass into a
kind of liminal state--

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.420 align:middle line:84%
an in-between state, somewhat
like a trance state--

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:90%
but speaking very conscious.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the great master of the
carving would take their hands,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.085 align:middle line:84%
and they would carve
at the same time

00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:41.615 align:middle line:84%
that they heard beautifully the
wonderful Balinese, interesting

00:18:41.615 --> 00:18:42.115 align:middle line:90%
music.

00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:42.906 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Music, yes.

00:18:42.906 --> 00:18:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And then I brought
a lot of my students over,

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.875 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us produced
a blooming masterpiece

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:90%
as far as I'm concerned.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we were being trained
in their way of shifting

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, of getting-- of
becoming the very thing that we

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.339 align:middle line:84%
were painting or
carving or dancing.

00:18:58.339 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
that we, as a society,

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
now have gotten so
far away from that?

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten so heady about
the five steps, the ten steps

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to this and that, and
we've lost touch with--

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: I'm laughing because
various publishers have been

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.267 align:middle line:84%
saying, now why don't you
write a book as the five steps

00:19:15.267 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:90%
and I keep refusing.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I see them come across
my desk all the time, yes.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how linear
have we gotten

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:90%
in our thinking I should ask?

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.368 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, you
know, wait a minute.

00:19:25.368 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I went to school at a
time that art was still

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.650 align:middle line:84%
important in the
classroom-- art and music.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.372 align:middle line:84%
So we drew and we
painted and we danced.

00:19:34.372 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
how you learned.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And this
is the way we learned.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.298 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: It was
starting probably

00:19:40.298 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
in the late '60s, et
cetera, that all of this

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
was taken away for--
though they kept sports.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
They did keep sports, but
they took out music and art.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
When you take out music and
art, you hurt a child's brain.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.586 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: I go into
schools around the world,

00:19:55.586 --> 00:19:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things
is I do is restore

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:90%
the culture in the school.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of the lousy, British,
Missionary education which

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
the Brits themselves
abandoned a long time.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Put art and music
back into the culture

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:90%
of the schools of Bangladesh.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Put the drumming.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Put the weaving.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if children are
dancing and singing and arting

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and incarnating information,
they do not forget.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But if it's this kind of
thing with abstraction

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.640 align:middle line:84%
now you have all these
fractions by tomorrow,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to learn it.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
We are as different from
each other as snowflakes.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:84%
We are not flaky; we are
snowflakey in our variation.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But art and music, and
dancing, and drumming,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and all of these things activate
different learning capacities

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:90%
and latencies.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
say, do you know,

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Lisa I have never
seen a stupid child.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I have seen incredibly
stupid systems of education

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.852 align:middle line:84%
that reduce,
diminish, and demean.

00:20:52.852 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That part
of the brain that

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
does develop the music is the
same part of the brain that

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:84%
develops the math and
that way of thinking.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: The
mathematics, very much so.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why is
that now considered

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:90%
an extracurricular activity?

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:04.581 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I'm asking you.

00:21:04.581 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is-- we've
gotten so far away from--

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: There's many
political reasons for that.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:90%
Part of it is finance, you know.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is there's just
so many more things to learn.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:90%
And so they put that in.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
many machines have

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:90%
replaced things-- the computers.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.496 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: All these kids with
their transcendental thumbs

00:21:27.496 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect with each
other on their mobile phones.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, exactly.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:90%
To where we are now.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.424 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: But there's an
immensity of information,

00:21:33.424 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:84%
most of which they
will not learn.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's deeply unfortunate,
and I've written extensively

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
about this in my
book, "Jump Time."

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and I want
to talk to you about that.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And also in my
book-- my really good book--

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
which is my autobiography
that talks about this,

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:90%
"A Mythic Life."

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: "A Mythic Life."

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
They're all really good books,
but that one was wonderful.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you about--
you touched on politics

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:84%
for a second there,
and you have--

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.304 align:middle line:90%
I have to ask you about--

00:21:57.304 --> 00:21:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: [GROANING].

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have to
because you have spoken

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and you have spent time
with these political leaders

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:90%
and the US presidents.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:90%
What is missing, Jean?

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's missing
that's led us to this state

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:90%
that we're in now?

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:18.565 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: I think it is the
sense of deep human community.

00:22:18.565 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.856 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yeah.

00:22:19.856 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And the abstraction
from so many things.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that when people
were involved with wind,

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
weather, and trees, and they did
whole processes from beginning

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.142 align:middle line:84%
to middle to the end,
they understood process.

00:22:34.142 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Now you throw a switch,
whoop, you got the beginning,

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
you got the end, you have
no idea of the middle.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And the middleman, whether
it's political or in business,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:90%
takes over.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you are the recipient
of the end process,

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and you have lost
the process itself.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Which is, by the way,
why it is critical

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:84%
that women come into the
political arena, the business

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:84%
arena, because women
understand process.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:90%
They have to.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:90%
You bring children up.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you nurture.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:90%
You have gestation, yes.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Process.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Understand process.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Making things cohere,
develop, grow.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.600 align:middle line:84%
The subjective, inner world
being as important to many

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:90%
as the outer one.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe that the
single most important thing

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:84%
that has happened
the last 5,000 years

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
is women-- slowly but surely
in the last 50 to 100 years--

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
joining men as equals or as
partners in the whole domain

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:90%
of the human agenda.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.922 align:middle line:84%
Without that we are not going to
survive, and everybody agrees.

00:23:28.922 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everybody does agree.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.338 align:middle line:84%
But in a way that there was
a bit of a backlash where

00:23:32.338 --> 00:23:34.355 align:middle line:90%
women became men in order to--

00:23:34.355 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Second-rate men.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, in order
to match that energy.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And now the rise of
the-- we're able to now

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.824 align:middle line:84%
have a feminine power in
a political environment.

00:23:43.824 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: But I would say--

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.446 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Almost.

00:23:45.446 --> 00:23:45.902 align:middle line:90%
Almost.

00:23:45.902 --> 00:23:46.652 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Almost.

00:23:46.652 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Well there's still
a lot of issues.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe
that as women

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.180 align:middle line:84%
rise you're not going to see the
same kind of political problems

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:90%
at the same level.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
You always have
political problems,

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
but you really need a
much more of a balance.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:84%
In the countries where
that work-- let's

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.490 align:middle line:84%
say the Scandinavian
countries, the Netherlands--

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
it's pretty balanced
between women and men.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the health
care systems are balanced.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Health care systems.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:09.786 align:middle line:90%
Everything's balanced.

00:24:09.786 --> 00:24:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.184 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Education
is balanced.

00:24:11.184 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Food systems, yes.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:90%
If we could get to that place.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.714 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we're
moving too fast as a society?

00:24:16.714 --> 00:24:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get into the
teachings of "Jump Time,"

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
but I just have you
here and I would

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:84%
love to ask you is
the age of technology

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that we're living
in right now causing

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:84%
us to disconnect
so much from that?

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to end in a place
that you see as catastrophic?

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much energy
around the 2012 concept,

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.734 align:middle line:84%
and it's really more
of a bigger story.

00:24:37.734 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Oh, it's a very
huge story that we're in.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:84%
We're in the acceleration
of time and history.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just is
what's going on.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.862 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You sent chills through
my spine when you said that,

00:24:45.862 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.503 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And, also
at the same time,

00:24:47.503 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:84%
too many people live behind
screens-- television screens,

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.340 align:middle line:84%
iPods, iPads, you know,
iPhones, what have you.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And instead of living
their own life,

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:84%
they're living second
and third removal lives.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.812 align:middle line:84%
We need many more teaching
learning communities.

00:25:07.812 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
Margaret Mead said to me

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
on her deathbed,
she said, you know

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm lying here being an
anthropologist on my own dying.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating experience.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no hierarchy to it.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And from what I'm
seeing, I want you

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:84%
to forget everything
I've been teaching you

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.501 align:middle line:84%
about working with
governments and bureaucracies.

00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
She'd been teaching me for six
years-- now you tell me this?

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Now?

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
She's got like a
day to live here.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, she says.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I see if we're going to
grow and green our time,

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
it's a question of
people getting together

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.830 align:middle line:84%
in teaching learning
communities- no guru.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.965 align:middle line:84%
Guru is spelled
"gee, you are you."

00:25:45.965 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.695 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Very little money
if you can get away with it.

00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Lots of good food, music.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But really, she said, doing
deep growing together-- growing

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.275 align:middle line:84%
in body and mind and spirit--
using your kinds of exercises,

00:26:03.275 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Jean, other people's
exercises, whatever it is,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:84%
but really getting
together in these teaching

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:84%
learning communities
and growing together.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:84%
They are not
psycho-therapeutic communities.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
That's for other
kinds of communities.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.049 align:middle line:90%
They are mutual growth.

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
watch out if you have

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
a psychologist in the
middle because they'll

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.860 align:middle line:90%
want to lead it.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.359 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be people--
shared guidance.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But as you grow
and as you expand

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.235 align:middle line:84%
these capacities-- something
that I've devoted my life to,

00:26:29.235 --> 00:26:31.130 align:middle line:84%
you know-- then
you will know what

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
needs to be done
in the community.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And you will be able to go
into the communities and say,

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.127 align:middle line:84%
we have to have a
light here where

00:26:38.127 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
people have been
getting killed, we've

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
got to have a center
for battered women

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
where they really get to
recover their self esteem

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and what they can really
do, and valuable employment

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.064 align:middle line:84%
in the world, we
have to do this.

00:26:50.064 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we've done.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.752 align:middle line:84%
And she said, when the time
is right, you go out there

00:26:53.752 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:90%
and you make it happen.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.107 align:middle line:84%
I said, yes ma'am, I will,
and in my own way I've tried.

00:26:57.107 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that is what you do.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Among other things.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's
talk about that.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:84%
How do you explore
in individuals--

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.670 align:middle line:84%
in bringing this to a practical
level of this conversation--

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:90%
exercises that you teach?

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:90%
What is jump time?

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.352 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:27:12.352 --> 00:27:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, it's the
acceleration of everything.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:90%
First of all, what is jump time?

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.486 align:middle line:84%
Jump time is a time of what is
called punctuated equilibrium.

00:27:22.486 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Now what do I mean by that?

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a fossil
record of any species--

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:84%
any species that existed
hundreds of thousands of years

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
ago or a million
years ago-- you see

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:84%
in the fossil record
over the years

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.650 align:middle line:90%
it looks pretty much the same.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
whoop, very quickly

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
it has developed all kinds
of new appendages, qualities,

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Evolved.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Evolved, but it
evolves in jumps for the--

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Innate.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.308 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: --most part.

00:27:48.308 --> 00:27:50.125 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't evolve
la, la, la, la.

00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Slowly.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a quantum leap evolvement.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.238 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Well, it's a leap.

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
an exponential leap.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So maybe things get
too hot, and they've

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:84%
got things you've got to grow
very fast however it happens.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So give me some
examples of what that would be.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.491 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, in
terms of-- let's take--

00:28:03.491 --> 00:28:05.400 align:middle line:84%
let's not talk about
the animal world,

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about
the human world.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.336 align:middle line:84%
In the human world,
you find-- and I

00:28:10.336 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:84%
do a little shtick
on this, too--

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that the jumps in culture will
often-- or of our human growth

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
will often happen
very, very quickly.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.139 align:middle line:90%
And we are in a jump time now.

00:28:21.139 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:84%
If you want me to do
something about that, I can.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I absolutely do.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
jump-- Jean has

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:90%
an amazing poem that you wrote.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.740 align:middle line:84%
I call it a poem,
but it's a movement.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.574 align:middle line:90%
It's an inspiration.

00:28:33.574 --> 00:28:35.531 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through
that in just a second

00:28:35.531 --> 00:28:36.910 align:middle line:84%
because it gets
us up on our feet

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.982 align:middle line:84%
and get us moving to a
place of-- but I want

00:28:38.982 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to talk a little
bit more about it.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: But
that's what I mean--

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
the equilibrium of things
of being same old, same old,

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:90%
it shifts.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
it's punctuated,

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you move
to the next stage.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And we are in one of the
singularities of history

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.620 align:middle line:84%
of the all time jumps
that is happening now.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What defines
that specifically?

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it spoken
about but in vague terms.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.867 align:middle line:84%
What specifically defines this
time, right now, as jump time?

00:29:04.867 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: We just spoke
about one of them--

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.658 align:middle line:84%
the rise of women to full
partnership with men.

00:29:08.658 --> 00:29:09.895 align:middle line:90%
That's a massive change.

00:29:09.895 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is true.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: The new technologies.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:84%
The world mind taking
a walk with itself.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that we are--
we cannot be separated the way

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.640 align:middle line:90%
that we have been in the past.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The world mind is
taking a walk with itself.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: That's a
very, very large one.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we
are interconnected

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:90%
with almost everybody.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten how many
people have computers,

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:90%
but it's in the billions.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.280 align:middle line:90%
It's in the billions.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:84%
How many people on
the mobile phone?

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Billions.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I have been in
situations where I've

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
been in a jungle
setting in the Orinoco

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a naked Indian
coming out with a smartphone.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.914 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, no way.

00:29:46.914 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yeah, you-- you--

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my God.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: You know,
very few people

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.050 align:middle line:84%
are innocent of
other people anymore.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And this was not
true when I first

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:84%
began traveling as
long ago as 1958.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:90%
It has shifted radically.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And with it, the level
of fear of the other

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.185 align:middle line:90%
has also risen exponentially.

00:30:07.185 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That comes with it.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: The fear
between the religions.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.342 align:middle line:90%
The fear between--

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because we
know so much more now?

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Or because it's
much more available?

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: No, it's because
suddenly-- because we

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:84%
are so interconnected, we are
not cut off from the realities.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Before, you lived
under the baron.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:90%
You plowed his land.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:90%
You were the serf.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:90%
You're not that anymore.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.099 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Occupy Movements
that spread all over, which

00:30:29.099 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:84%
are going to become--
which are going

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.204 align:middle line:90%
to multiply in many new ways.

00:30:32.204 --> 00:30:33.120 align:middle line:90%

This is very bad ecology.

00:30:52.464 --> 00:30:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's out of balance.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.713 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: It's out of
balance, and we have access

00:30:55.713 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
to the knowledge
of that, you see.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.340 align:middle line:90%

We don't even know what
the full potential is,

00:31:10.496 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:84%
but certainly a larger use
of the self and a larger

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:20.060 align:middle line:84%
use-- a larger community
co-creativeness that can really

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.710 align:middle line:84%
turn the tides of
life and history.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I think we're moving--
I mean, I don't know.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I would've said
that we're moving

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:84%
toward a kind of
planetary civilization--

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.190 align:middle line:84%
not a world civilization but
a planetary civilization.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:84%
We have a high emphasis on
culture-- cultures themselves

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.900 align:middle line:84%
becoming more, not less,
within the next 50 years.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Government as we understand it
now will be very, very changed.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Because people have direct
access to a democratic process

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:84%
which they lost for
many, many years--

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: --while
we were so separated.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the power goes back
into the hands of the people?

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Pretty
much so, I think.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.597 align:middle line:84%
So if you can do with me,
you have an exercise that I--

00:32:00.597 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Many exercises.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know you do.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Thousands of them.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're an--

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: 130,000 pages
of them, actually,--

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.401 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A hundred--

00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: --of lectures
and exercises unpublished.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.593 align:middle line:90%
So can you share one--

00:32:11.593 --> 00:32:12.634 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: 130,000 pages?

00:32:12.634 --> 00:32:13.133 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:32:13.133 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:90%
How much time do we have?

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.697 align:middle line:84%
Share one of them with
us so that people at home

00:32:17.697 --> 00:32:19.155 align:middle line:84%
can take this to
a practical level.

00:32:19.155 --> 00:32:20.552 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: All right.

00:32:20.552 --> 00:32:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of
studies in creativity.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And I once made a
study of 55 of some

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:84%
of the most creative-- I mean
sustained creative people

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:90%
in North America.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Among my research subjects was
Margaret Mead, Joseph Campbell,

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.542 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller,
Jonas Salk, and then

00:32:39.542 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people whose names
you would not necessarily

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
know that had high
sustained creativity.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were very different
from each other-- very

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
However, there were
things that were

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:90%
subconstant in all of them.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:32:53.395 --> 00:32:53.810 align:middle line:90%
What was the same?

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.768 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: They were
fascinated by the workings

00:32:55.768 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:90%
of their own mind.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.280 align:middle line:84%
They were archaeologists
of their own mind.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.320 align:middle line:84%
They were spelunkers in the
caves of their creativity.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And they took their
own mind seriously.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And they delved into
them-- not just in thinking

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:90%
but in sensory.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:13.210 align:middle line:84%
They were all high sensates
in one way or another.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.990 align:middle line:84%
They might be lacking
one major sense,

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
but they would
have it in spades.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.019 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell was
not an imagizer.

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But he comes out and
writes all these books

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.667 align:middle line:84%
on images and symbols and myths
because he was an athlete.

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:90%
He was a high kinesthetic.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:25.584 align:middle line:90%
He felt them.

00:33:25.584 --> 00:33:27.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why he writes a
book called "The Hero's

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Journey," not "The
Hero's Symbol."

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Margaret Mead had all
the senses, you see.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.594 align:middle line:90%
And so what I would do--

00:33:34.594 --> 00:33:36.135 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she lived
to her fullest--

00:33:36.135 --> 00:33:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Full,
full sensory life.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Rich, rich, rich.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And full memory.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.274 align:middle line:84%
She had the greatest
memory I've ever seen.

00:33:42.274 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did she?

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And she could also
remember six, seven, eight

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:84%
dreams of a night because her
inner senses were so acute.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Now when I studied how these
people thought and then began

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.990 align:middle line:84%
to abstract from this
and create exercises,

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:59.485 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things that you
have to do not only to activate

00:33:59.485 --> 00:34:02.390 align:middle line:84%
the intui-- what are called
the inner propioceptives--

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.810 align:middle line:84%
the inner images-- how
many people out there,

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.441 align:middle line:90%
for example, think in pictures?

00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:90%
You can close your eyes.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:90%
You see pictures.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Some people think in words.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm a word person.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Some are kinesthetic--
you think in movement.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.580 align:middle line:84%
We have some great
tasters there.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:84%
People like Julia Child
was a phenomenal taster.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:84%
She could taste
something and then

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:24.280 align:middle line:84%
she could be back there when it
was first-- she first tasted it

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:90%
60 years before.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.719 align:middle line:90%
Then you have snifters.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.710 align:middle line:84%
All of us are combinations,
but most of us

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.070 align:middle line:90%
have one or two dominants.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Like mine is audio
and kinesthetic.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can hear
it and then feel it?

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.456 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Whereas
my late husband

00:34:41.456 --> 00:34:44.237 align:middle line:90%
was a phenomenal visualizer.

00:34:44.237 --> 00:34:45.820 align:middle line:84%
If he was here-- if
he could come back

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:84%
from wherever he is now and I
would say, Bob, tell the folks,

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:52.155 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes, tell
them what you see.

00:34:52.155 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:84%
He'd say, well, here
I am in ancient Egypt

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.757 align:middle line:84%
and they are building the
pyramid to me, the pharaoh.

00:34:59.757 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:90%
He was always the pharaoh.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:90%
He was never the serf, you know.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And the great bird,
the great Horus falcon,

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:84%
comes and plucks
me up and takes me

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the
pyramid where I

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.870 align:middle line:84%
see the great Sekhmet, the
lion-headed goddess, who

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.760 align:middle line:84%
opens her golden
jaws and swallows me.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And I am now in a land
of emerald green Buddhas.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, this will go on and on and
and on and on and on and on.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Me-- I close my
eyes, and if I cheat

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I see the tiles on
the bathroom floor.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little better than that
now because I worked at it.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.690 align:middle line:84%
But I am auditory
and kinesthetic.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:32.690 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.255 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am auditory.

00:35:34.255 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: You're auditory?

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, actually,
I actually-- more visual.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:37.943 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:35:37.943 --> 00:35:40.192 align:middle line:84%
I can see into lifetimes
and lifetimes and lifetimes

00:35:40.192 --> 00:35:40.775 align:middle line:90%
and lifetimes.

00:35:40.775 --> 00:35:41.277 align:middle line:90%


00:35:41.277 --> 00:35:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Can you really?

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh my.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I do.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.155 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: That's
wonderful, to be visual.

00:35:45.155 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not visual at all.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just tiny bit.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:49.966 align:middle line:90%
But boy, do I hear things.

00:35:49.966 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:51.090 align:middle line:90%
I heard.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
You've repeated
phrases and sentences

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that you-- dates that you
specifically remember.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Because I
remember them as sounds.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, for example, we can
use, we can activate,

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:07.170 align:middle line:84%
these interior senses
so that we begin

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to really regrow those
parts of our brain.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'll do it with
everybody, but I'm

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.370 align:middle line:90%
going to use you as the example.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.390 align:middle line:90%
May I?

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So first we're
going to go through the senses.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But first, I'm going to use
it-- I'll do a doubled exercise.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to show people the art
and science of manifestation

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.895 align:middle line:84%
by the activation
of interior images.

00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:29.645 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:36:29.645 --> 00:36:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: OK?

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.606 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this would
transition anyone

00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:33.990 align:middle line:84%
from wherever you are to the
place that you want to be?

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Exactly.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, great.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Now what
I'd like you to do

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.180 align:middle line:84%
is think about something
that you'd really

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.780 align:middle line:84%
like to accomplish pretty soon--
the next few weeks, few months.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Think of something
you'd like to do.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else,
you think of something

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.081 align:middle line:90%
you'd like to accomplish.

00:36:46.081 --> 00:36:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmmm.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I would like to have quality
time with my family-- not

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:53.950 align:middle line:90%
rushed time.

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.052 align:middle line:90%
Quality.

00:36:55.052 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: You have
what a nine-year-old?

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have a nine-year-old
and an incredible husband.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.220 align:middle line:84%

Welcome back.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, and my
guest is Jean Houston.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We are exploring
the possible human,

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:55.230 align:middle line:84%
which is what Jean
basically coined

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.740 align:middle line:84%
this term, the possible
human, if you could.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Those two words together are
a beautiful combination--

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:84%
the possible human-- when we,
at some points in our life,

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.460 align:middle line:84%
lose a lot of
possibility and that

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.670 align:middle line:90%
around our story of possibility.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:13.300 align:middle line:90%
So the story is changing for us.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.060 align:middle line:90%
With whom is it changing?

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, just
about everybody.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:17.887 align:middle line:90%
Give me a category.

00:45:17.887 --> 00:45:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We were talking
earlier about women.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.428 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Women.

00:45:20.428 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in India-- this
is some years ago--

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in a village,
small village,

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and it has one television
set owned by an old Brahmin

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:90%
lady, high caste lady.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And she has placed
it in the trees.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And people come
in from the fields

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and they tie up
their water buffalo

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and they come and sit down to
watch the "Ramayana," which

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.990 align:middle line:84%
at this point was every Sunday
and I think 30 episodes.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:49.690 align:middle line:90%
It is the core story of India.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:51.560 align:middle line:84%
It pervades everything
in Indian life.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the story of Prince
Rama, the noble Prince

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Rama, and his beautiful
wife, Princess Sita, and how

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.450 align:middle line:84%
they are betrayed
of their kingdom

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and go and spend 14 years
living in the forest.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
lovely life there.

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But then she is abducted by a
ten-headed demon called Ravana

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:84%
who takes her away and to
Sri Lanka, his kingdom.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And poor, distraught Rama
gathers armies, his own armies

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and an army of monkeys led
by the glorious Hanuman

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.890 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And they build a bridge
to Sri Lanka, and they go

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and they, ultimately
after tremendous battles,

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.725 align:middle line:90%
they rescue her.

00:46:31.725 --> 00:46:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Well this is one of the
most beautiful things

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.391 align:middle line:90%
you have ever seen.

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And great costumes and
tremendous, glorious songs.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And mighty acts.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of-- it's just
sheer poetry and glory.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, oh, I wish
we had something like this.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.980 align:middle line:84%
When suddenly, the old
Brahmin lady turns to me--

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.790 align:middle line:84%
she's good English--
and she says to me,

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.140 align:middle line:90%
oh, I don't like Princess Sita.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.290 align:middle line:90%
She is much too passive.

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:55.530 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.560 align:middle line:84%
We women in India, we are
much stronger than that.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to change the story--
not make her so passive.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:06.269 align:middle line:84%
But madam, the story is at
least 3,000 or 4,000 years old.

00:47:06.269 --> 00:47:06.810 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:07.740 align:middle line:90%
It's very old.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.650 align:middle line:84%
All the more reason
we have to change it.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:11.310 align:middle line:84%
We women in India,
we are strong.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.640 align:middle line:90%
We are full of purpose.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.920 align:middle line:84%
We really take
care of everything.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.670 align:middle line:90%
My name is Sita.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:20.050 align:middle line:84%
My husband's name is Rama, same
as there, very common in India.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:21.300 align:middle line:90%
He is a lazy bum.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Anything happen, I'd
have to rescue him.

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:24.950 align:middle line:90%
We have to change the story.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Show the strength of women.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.370 align:middle line:90%
The strength of women.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was
laughing and agreeing.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.790 align:middle line:90%
And I was so shocked.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:35.414 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: So, then, how do
we take that large picture

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and change the
story that we have

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.180 align:middle line:84%
about our past--
about our experiences

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.350 align:middle line:90%
that may have been traumatic?

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:90%
How do we change those stories?

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: One of the ways

as well as around the world
but also seminars here--

is I take a great story,
like the "Ramayana,"

like the life of Gandhi, like--

00:49:26.935 --> 00:49:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The life of Christ.

the life of Christ, the quest

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.080 align:middle line:90%
of Oz."

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my next book is
called "The Wizard of Us."

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, let's take "The
Wizard of Oz" as an example.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.419 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:40.419 --> 00:49:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And what I do is I
have people have experiences

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that follow the trend, the
unfolding of the story,

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.090 align:middle line:84%
but learning different
kinds of things throughout.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
"The Wizard of Oz"

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.476 align:middle line:90%
deals with Dorothy living in--

00:49:58.476 --> 00:49:59.100 align:middle line:90%

She goes to her auntie, Auntie

Oh, go away Dorothy.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Can't you see we're
counting our chickens?

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, the American
way-- counting the chickens.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And something
awful is happening.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.949 align:middle line:84%
The naughty-- the dreadful

Anyway, what happens?

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Where are we in our
lives that we really

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.810 align:middle line:84%
feel we are at the
end of one story

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and we're not at the beginning,
but something in us is calling?

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Something in us is saying,
you are so much more

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and you can be so much more.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, you need a journey.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But often it takes a tornado
or something to shake you up.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Something catastrophic.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: How have
you been shaken up?

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, it doesn't have
to be catastrophic,

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.658 align:middle line:90%
but it's got to shake you up.

00:50:53.658 --> 00:50:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Trauma shakes you up.

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yeah.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.424 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A move.

00:50:56.424 --> 00:50:57.720 align:middle line:90%
A death of a loved one.

>>HOUSTON: Whatever.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.885 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
there inevitably

00:51:00.885 --> 00:51:03.010 align:middle line:84%
in our lives something
that's going to shake us up.

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.742 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe just abject boredom--
we have got to get out of here.

00:51:05.742 --> 00:51:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lack of purpose, yes.

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:08.075 align:middle line:90%

Same old, same old.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Living in serial
monotony, you know.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.530 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it is the tornado.

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And in the book-- Frank Baum--
the actual house actually moves

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and then it's a
dream in the movie.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:29.917 align:middle line:84%
But she lands in her
creative unconscious.

00:51:29.917 --> 00:51:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Remember it moves out of--

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yellow brick road.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Yes, and she moves
out of the black and white

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.220 align:middle line:84%
into this colorful

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.220 align:middle line:90%
meets people who appreciate her.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.270 align:middle line:84%
That's important, so
I might do something

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:42.680 align:middle line:84%
about deep appreciation
between people.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing
better than deep,

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:49.260 align:middle line:84%
deep seeing appreciation of the
other than to call them forth.

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And she's appreciated
by these little people.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So to get
out of your story?

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.446 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yeah.

00:51:53.446 --> 00:51:55.810 align:middle line:84%

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: That's right.

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're getting
there, you see.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.595 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:51:57.595 --> 00:51:58.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.625 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And then
comes the archetype

00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:84%
of the beloved-- the
great guidance figure--

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Glinda the Good Witch.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So we get in touch
with a higher self

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.470 align:middle line:84%
that gives us the
higher guidance.

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I call it the intelligy-- the
deep, dynamic, purposeful high

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:18.370 align:middle line:84%
self that is ourselves as if
we'd had a thousand years to do

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:21.030 align:middle line:84%
our own development,
our human homework.

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.810 align:middle line:90%
And there she is.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And she sets her on a new
path, the yellow brick road.

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.032 align:middle line:90%
The road of spiritual pollen.

00:52:27.032 --> 00:52:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Follow the yellow brick road.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:84%

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:30.621 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Spiritual pollen.

00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:31.490 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: She meets
disempowered parts of herself.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.410 align:middle line:84%
She meets the
disempowered mind--

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:39.890 align:middle line:84%
the Scarecrow-- who will
prove during their journey

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.690 align:middle line:90%
to have enormous intelligence.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I
may do an exercise

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.590 align:middle line:84%
to activate the

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tap into the
enormous, different kinds

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:52.710 align:middle line:84%
of resources of different
kinds of intelligence

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:53.420 align:middle line:90%
that we all have.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There are so many.

>>HOUSTON: So I'll
train people in that.

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Then she meets the
disempowered heart

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:59.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Tin Man, who
actually turns out

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.170 align:middle line:84%
to be the most sympathetic,
the most radically empathic.

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And we develop heartful
processes and the ability

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.610 align:middle line:84%
to be empathic to others
and to deeply understand,

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.760 align:middle line:84%
to cross the great
divide of otherness,

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.210 align:middle line:84%
to have the compassion
that sees deeply

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:20.080 align:middle line:84%
into the heart of another as
well as into our own hearts.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.390 align:middle line:90%
And heal the heart, too.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:22.900 align:middle line:90%
We do a lot of healing.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the disempowered
courage in the Cowardly Lion

he takes the risks.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.920 align:middle line:90%
He takes the great leaps.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.510 align:middle line:90%
He carries them on the back.

He's scared, but by

You face evil.

you know, watching the journey.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:06.270 align:middle line:84%

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.990 align:middle line:84%
but the dog runs
after a Siamese cat.

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:51.762 align:middle line:84%
And so she has to
find out from Glinda

00:54:51.762 --> 00:54:54.730 align:middle line:90%
that it was there all the time.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's basically
what we have in all of us.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: That's what we have.

00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:58.944 align:middle line:84%
And when she gets
home, she says,

00:54:58.944 --> 00:55:01.955 align:middle line:84%
it's in-- I realize it
was in me all the time.

00:55:01.955 --> 00:55:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All the time.

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.969 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And it was the
collective unconscious

00:55:04.969 --> 00:55:07.020 align:middle line:84%
of the human race
that she tunes into.

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We have so much inside
of us all the time.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And what my work is
about is to help people

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.040 align:middle line:84%
through these activations,
through these exercises,

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.850 align:middle line:84%
to really discover that
we are the wizard, that we

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.050 align:middle line:90%
are the possible human.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To draw that out of
us and to bring that out of us

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.860 align:middle line:84%
in a way that carries
us out of a stuck place.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But what about when you
feel that that tragedy is

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:35.050 align:middle line:84%
so concrete, so
disabling, so real?

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:38.787 align:middle line:84%
You had the experience of
losing your husband of 42--

00:55:38.787 --> 00:55:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: 43 years.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --43 years.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: I was well married.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:43.055 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well married.

00:55:43.055 --> 00:55:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes.

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:44.496 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And happily married.

00:55:44.496 --> 00:55:45.237 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes.

00:55:45.237 --> 00:55:47.570 align:middle line:84%
With the wonderful ups and
downs that we all go through.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.400 align:middle line:90%
That's marriage.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: That's the nature.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, of marriage.

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:51.940 align:middle line:90%
That's a good distinction.

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But when you went
through that experience--

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and this was not so long ago--

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: No, it wasn't.

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --how did you
deal with that loss?

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, I prepared for
it because I knew he was dying.

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do prepare
for something--

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: I knew he was dying.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But we all
know that eventually--

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So what I did
is I sat down with him,

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and I interviewed him
while he lay in bed.

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed
him on his life.

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:15.635 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes.

00:56:15.635 --> 00:56:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And incidents and things
that-- so that we were together

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:23.295 align:middle line:84%
in the remembrance and
the harvest of his life.

00:56:23.295 --> 00:56:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was a beautiful-- we
did this for several months

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:26.679 align:middle line:90%
before he died.

00:56:26.679 --> 00:56:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As he was--

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:29.053 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And that
was very important

00:56:29.053 --> 00:56:33.580 align:middle line:84%
so that we had these deep
times of mutual remembrance.

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: At any time though,
although you knew he was sick,

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.980 align:middle line:84%
at any time during that
experience did you think

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I can make him live, I can do
this, we can do this together.

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Did you have--

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, we
did a lot together.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's became clear
in the last year

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that he-- because he had
congestive heart failure.

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was very delicate,
tender, and very beautiful

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.390 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So the very fact that
we completed together--

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:04.367 align:middle line:84%
do you see it wasn't sudden,
we completed together.

00:57:04.367 --> 00:57:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: It's much more
difficult when it is sudden.

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.073 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:57:08.073 --> 00:57:10.295 align:middle line:84%
So you completed together
while he was still alive.

00:57:10.295 --> 00:57:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes.

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then,
yet, after he was gone

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and his body did
leave this planet,

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:20.780 align:middle line:84%
do you feel that there's a hole
that still needs filling there?

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Or is it that completion?

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Did it carry over?

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well,
you know what I did?

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:24.800 align:middle line:90%
He was cremated.

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And I knew he was very
close to ancient Egypt.

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And a month or two after
he died, I went to Egypt.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.257 align:middle line:84%
And I put his ashes between
the paws of the Sphinx--

00:57:35.257 --> 00:57:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, you did?

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: --and
also on the walls

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:42.260 align:middle line:84%
of an archetype of the Sekhmet
that he was greatly attached to

00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:44.190 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I carried him forth
into the next places,

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:51.720 align:middle line:84%
you see, and had a
sense of his-- well,

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I happen to believe
in continuity.

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.986 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I was going to
say, do you still communicate?

00:57:55.986 --> 00:57:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: I don't.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:01.654 align:middle line:84%
It's as if he's moved
on to something else.

00:58:01.654 --> 00:58:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not
necessarily to give in

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to that kind of--
though people around me

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.680 align:middle line:90%
did have a sense of that.

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.259 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, but you feel more
complete about the entire--

00:58:11.259 --> 00:58:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Oh, yes.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.095 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:58:13.095 --> 00:58:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Yes, I do.

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see that.

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: But I was
married for 43 years,

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and he was dying
for a year, you see.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.961 align:middle line:90%
So there was that.

00:58:19.961 --> 00:58:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that's
hardly an excuse.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:23.310 align:middle line:84%
People are in the situation
of being married for so--

00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: People-- yes.

00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:25.810 align:middle line:90%
And they feel the hole.

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: But we were
filling the hole already.

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The whole time.

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: You know there are
many cultures that do this.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:33.470 align:middle line:90%
They prepare for the dying.

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:35.240 align:middle line:90%
They prepare for it.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And so by interviewing
him and being

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:44.440 align:middle line:84%
able to re-live
that life together,

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that we came to the natural
ending and the opening

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:48.130 align:middle line:90%
to the next stage.

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:49.796 align:middle line:84%
And we both happen
to believe that there

00:58:49.796 --> 00:58:51.850 align:middle line:84%
was that deep continuity
of one kind or another.

00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:52.516 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:58:52.516 --> 00:58:57.410 align:middle line:84%
You really do embody the
power of the possible human.

00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, I
struggle at it, you know.

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:01.992 align:middle line:84%
I keep knocking on the
door of the possibility.

00:59:01.992 --> 00:59:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I like that
you say that as well.

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's-- but
you're humble about it.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But look what you did
in that experience.

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:13.650 align:middle line:84%
You embodied the possibilities
that yet our entire culture

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and society has formed
our opinions around death

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.570 align:middle line:84%
being a final,
devastating experience.

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:23.084 align:middle line:84%
And you preempted it with
something that was filled.

00:59:23.084 --> 00:59:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, there
was also something else

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.050 align:middle line:84%
that I did that I've never
spoken about publicly.

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:31.410 align:middle line:84%
He was up at one of
the major birthdays

00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:33.870 align:middle line:84%
just a year or two before--
it was several years

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:34.740 align:middle line:90%
before he died.

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Major birthday a few
years before he died.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:41.662 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was very important
for him-- this birthday.

00:59:41.662 --> 00:59:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So I said, who would you
like at your birthday?

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And he named all these
people that he admired.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Margaret Mead.

00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Joseph Campbell.

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:53.230 align:middle line:84%
A man-- a great psychophysical
master-- Feldenkrais.

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:56.612 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there were about
a-- oh, Jean Possault.

00:59:56.612 --> 00:59:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Simone de Voiver-- because he
had studied with him in Paris

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:01.197 align:middle line:90%
when he was a very young man.

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:03.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's who I'd
like at my birthday.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:04.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't tell him
what I was going to do,

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:10.460 align:middle line:84%
but I got big blow-up
pictures of each one.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.635 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And we had a big
table that I put them around.

01:00:13.635 --> 01:00:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And I got little CDs
of their speaking.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.857 align:middle line:84%
And I put-- I borrowed
everybody's CD--

01:00:18.857 --> 01:00:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What a great idea.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And I got
them all so they were all

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.480 align:middle line:90%
talking simultaneously.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And then-- Bob
didn't know what was

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.910 align:middle line:84%
going on-- I brought
him into his birthday.

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And there were all the people
that he had wanted to have.

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my God.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: All of
them were dead,

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:33.462 align:middle line:90%
but there they were alive.

01:00:33.462 --> 01:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
talking simultaneously.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:36.170 align:middle line:90%
It was a great birthday.

Peace that is so rich, so

01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:52.160 align:middle line:84%
sense to make peace to shift
the dangerous and fearful

tell you what happens

01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
is after a while
you fall asleep.

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And your mouth keeps

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
sort of stunned at what you
have found yourself saying.

01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%

myself saying was

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that many of the images, the

about it.

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And a protest is one part,
but beyond the protest

>>LISA: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Centers for children

New ideas for the community.

What could it look like?

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have a
passionate inner vision,

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
when you have the inner
architecture of what

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
a community or a family
or a culture can be,

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.200 align:middle line:90%
then things start to move.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.117 align:middle line:84%
But without the ideas,
things don't tend to happen.

01:05:41.117 --> 01:05:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the community
centers and those types

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
of things that
reinstated the culture

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:47.590 align:middle line:84%

what you taught.

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:49.048 align:middle line:84%

01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
If you are one of those
people that likes steps

01:05:57.290 --> 01:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%

to limitless possibilities.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is a three-step

condensed into three steps.

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:10.559 align:middle line:84%

is thinking in images.

01:06:10.559 --> 01:06:12.100 align:middle line:84%

lot of that today.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, part of
it yes, that's one of them.

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Thinking in images.

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Making use of the fact that
you are not just a simple ego.

01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Ego is but one image among the
multiple images of the psyche.

You have many people in you.

I'm a teacher.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%

01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:07.030 align:middle line:90%
I am an orator.

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:11.050 align:middle line:90%
I am a nature lover.

01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:12.960 align:middle line:90%
I am a healer.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.377 align:middle line:90%
I am an energy shifter.

01:07:16.377 --> 01:07:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: OK.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:17.459 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:07:17.459 --> 01:07:18.170 align:middle line:90%
That's very good.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:19.681 align:middle line:90%
The wild cards-- bring them up.

01:07:19.681 --> 01:07:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I am all about the
power of possibilities.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.510 align:middle line:90%
I am a forward thinker.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I am all about moving
into the future.

01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I am a possible seeker,
and I am a positive person.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: OK.

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:40.126 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Intentionally.

01:07:40.126 --> 01:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Now you
see, how do you then

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.860 align:middle line:84%
begin to develop two,
three, four, five,

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
or more of these
different persona

01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to bring them stage front?

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll give it from
my own example.

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:57.710 align:middle line:90%
I dislike writing intensely.

01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:58.335 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:07:58.335 --> 01:07:59.918 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And I'm
phobic for writing.

01:07:59.918 --> 01:08:01.002 align:middle line:90%
And I have my 27th--

01:08:01.002 --> 01:08:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 26th-- 27th book.

01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well,
27th is coming up.

01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And yet-- and I
have 130,000 pages

01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
unpublished because
my mystery school

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I had to write a small
book every month.

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.248 align:middle line:84%
And by the time it was
delivered in three days,

01:08:13.248 --> 01:08:14.379 align:middle line:90%
it was 400 pages.

01:08:14.379 --> 01:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for almost 29 years.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.779 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:17.479 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: OK.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Now what do I do?

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:24.556 align:middle line:84%
Because I sit down and if Jean
stares at the computer-- blank.

01:08:24.556 --> 01:08:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not
going to happen.

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:29.364 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: I happen to
be a very good cook.

01:08:29.364 --> 01:08:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:30.189 align:middle line:90%
Something I didn't realize.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: The reason
I'm a very good cook,

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.398 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a serious cook,
is because-- remember

01:08:34.398 --> 01:08:36.189 align:middle line:84%
I talked about my
parents getting divorced.

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:38.854 align:middle line:84%
Well, earlier when I was
noticing the problems between

01:08:38.854 --> 01:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
them, my mother-- whose name
was Maria Donciatta Seraphina

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Perpetua you know,
the Gratziella,--

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:47.304 align:middle line:84%
she was born in
Siracusa, Sicily,

01:08:47.304 --> 01:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and she marries Jack
Houston of Texas.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.684 align:middle line:90%
They hated each other's food.

01:08:52.684 --> 01:08:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can imagine.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: My father
could not abide

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.029 align:middle line:90%
the smell or look of garlic.

01:08:57.029 --> 01:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
He would say, Mary, those
things, those are stinkbugs.

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what the old witch
ladies down in Texas

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:04.460 align:middle line:84%
you know they hang
around their neck

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.490 align:middle line:90%
to fight off the run-at-yous.

01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:05.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.503 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where's the
meat and potatoes?

01:09:07.503 --> 01:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: We don't
eat those things.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:12.148 align:middle line:84%
Worse than that with
hush puppies and--

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.439 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Southern fried chicken.

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: That's right.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did to try
to keep them together

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.470 align:middle line:84%
is I became the
world's first fusion

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:21.590 align:middle line:90%
cook around eight or nine.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would make things
like chicken-fried polenta

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.399 align:middle line:84%
to try to get them-- Anyway,
I became a fusion cook.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed, and I
became the family cook.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.819 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: And I remain that.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:35.489 align:middle line:84%
So that I even had
relatives who would

01:09:35.489 --> 01:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
come to dinner who had
no idea what else I did.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
They would say, hey, Jean--
especially the Sicilian-- eh,

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.252 align:middle line:90%
she's a cook.

01:09:41.252 --> 01:09:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah?

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And
they once went to--

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're a cook.

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: --hear me
give a big speech,

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and everybody got
excited by this.

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Hey, Jean, now we thought all
these years all you could do

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.041 align:middle line:84%
was cook, you know,
and you talk good.

01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So as a
cook, I am not blocked.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.696 align:middle line:84%
So when I have to write,
I take on the cook

01:10:02.696 --> 01:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
or one of the other different
persona that works for me--

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.861 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Archetypes.

01:10:05.861 --> 01:10:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: --and I find that
I don't have the blocks.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And I stir in the ideas,
and I add the seasonings

01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:14.100 align:middle line:90%
of different associations.

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And the words begin
to come together.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
And as a cook, I am cooking.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.381 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See, I love how
you tie these things in.

01:10:20.381 --> 01:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Like how you did earlier
with the visualization,

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.016 align:middle line:90%
you tied that into my goal.

01:10:24.016 --> 01:10:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: So, for
example, if I were to say,

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
of these different
persona-- known

01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and also, maybe, latent--
choose one for me right now.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The forward thinker.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: The forward thinker.

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.584 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:10:35.584 --> 01:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Now as a forward thinker,
you are entirely now

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.333 align:middle line:90%
the forward thinker.

01:10:38.333 --> 01:10:39.999 align:middle line:84%
Normally, I would
put on music for you.

01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:40.790 align:middle line:90%
You would dance it.

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:42.331 align:middle line:84%
You would become
the forward thinker.

01:10:42.331 --> 01:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
You would walk and act and emote
and be the forward thinker.

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: And
that's happening now?

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I'm
a huge visualizer.

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:49.073 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: OK.

01:10:49.073 --> 01:10:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And then visualizer,
forward thinker,

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:53.690 align:middle line:84%
put yourself in that
family situation

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.110 align:middle line:90%
two or three months from now.

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:58.670 align:middle line:84%
But entirely not as Lisa
who you know, the ego of you

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, but as forward thinker.

01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Take her and see what happens.

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:02.672 align:middle line:90%
Now.

01:11:02.672 --> 01:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Take that
to the jump time.

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Take that.

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:05.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the jump.

01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Be that, and
be her doing that work

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.760 align:middle line:90%
with your family.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is--
pretty much I do that a lot.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:16.560 align:middle line:84%
When I set a goal, I
go to that-- the end.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Aren't these many,
many lost modes

01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.094 align:middle line:84%
of prayer where this has been
practiced in ancient cultures?

01:11:22.094 --> 01:11:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Absolutely.

01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And still are in indigenous
and native cultures.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so it has
since been lost in ours,

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to that acting
as if it has already happened

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and being in that
place of the cornstalks

01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
raising up to the armpits in
the deep mud of the rain that

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
has fallen in the
middle of a drought.

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:42.655 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
that feeling comes--

01:11:42.655 --> 01:11:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HOUSTON: Very good.

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --from.

That's where I love to
live is in that place

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.384 align:middle line:84%

what situation I'm in.

01:11:49.384 --> 01:11:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Now look what

01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Your descriptions have changed.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Your descriptors have changed.

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.140 align:middle line:90%
They are rich.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:55.723 align:middle line:90%
They are full.

01:11:55.723 --> 01:11:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Colorful.

01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON:They're bu--
And you can feel them.

01:11:58.150 --> 01:11:58.941 align:middle line:90%
You can touch them.

01:11:58.941 --> 01:12:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:01.926 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Because
you've already been--

01:12:01.926 --> 01:12:04.080 align:middle line:90%
you just shifted your persona.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're right.

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And to live in
that place is what

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.790 align:middle line:90%
the possible human is, right?

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:10.485 align:middle line:84%
To live in that
energy constantly.

01:12:10.485 --> 01:12:11.174 align:middle line:90%
Filled with--

01:12:11.174 --> 01:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HOUSTON: Well, not constantly
because you get tired out,

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:15.450 align:middle line:90%
but when you need it.

01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:18.230 align:middle line:84%
You can pull upon all
these different persona.

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And as you develop them,
then their skillful means,

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:25.675 align:middle line:84%
their skillful capacities,
can be utilized for anything

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:26.890 align:middle line:90%
