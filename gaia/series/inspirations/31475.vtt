>> Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam  Inspirations .

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.825 align:middle line:84%
Are you making enough
money in your life?

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:27.261 align:middle line:84%
If not, do you know
how much money you want

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.797 align:middle line:90%
to make this year, next year,

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly
is the question of why.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.302 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is one of
the featured visionaries

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:37.938 align:middle line:84%
of  The Secret  and  New York
Times  bestselling author,

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:90%
John Assaraf.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.842 align:middle line:84%
And he says if you want
to change your income,

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:45.546 align:middle line:84%
you need to recalibrate
your financial set point.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:46.881 align:middle line:90%
So how do you do this?

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.382 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today
is John Assaraf.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.284 align:middle line:84%
He's going to explain
some of his techniques

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:52.586 align:middle line:90%
on the Neuroscience of Success.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:53.587 align:middle line:90%
Welcome [chuckles].

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:54.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey Lisa, it's
great to be here.

00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:56.957 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great to have you here.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:57.958 align:middle line:90%
I love your smile.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.093 align:middle line:90%
You have such a warm smile.

00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:01.028 align:middle line:84%
I see you all the time
in my email [laughter].

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:04.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I love smiling and
love getting smiles right back.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you do.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.936 align:middle line:84%
So you have had a
lot of great mentors

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.638 align:middle line:90%
in your life, haven't you?

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:13.507 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit about your upbringing

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:17.344 align:middle line:84%
and how mentors changed
your life?

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:19.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I -- I think
the reason that I ended

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
up with mentors is I
had a wonderful mother

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and wonderful father who were
loving, caring, and kind,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.557 align:middle line:84%
but because they only went to
grade three and grade five,

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe, in school, they
really didn't have the knowledge

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.997 align:middle line:84%
and the skills of how to
operate in the real world other

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:38.032 align:middle line:84%
than their, [background
sirens] you know,

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:40.367 align:middle line:84%
paradigm of what was
possible for them.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.437 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background siren] They
finished school at grade three?

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.473 align:middle line:84%
>> My -- my mother was grade
three, my father was grade five.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:47.808 align:middle line:90%
>> In what country?

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> They were living in Israel
in Morocco at the time...

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.714 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and in those days what
was most important was to go

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:56.083 align:middle line:84%
out there and work and
make enough money to give

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:58.586 align:middle line:84%
to the family so that
everybody could eat.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.722 align:middle line:84%
And so school wasn't
the priority for them.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I remember
is, you know,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
there was always too much month
left at the end of the money

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.063 align:middle line:90%
and many of the arguments...

00:02:09.063 --> 00:02:10.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah [chuckles].

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:11.665 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and many of the
fights in our household was

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:15.869 align:middle line:84%
around the lack of money and
that there was always struggle

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
around not having enough and
trying to make ends meet.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny as I sit
here talking with you, I --

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.249 align:middle line:84%
I remember the feeling of how
I hated to hear the screams

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.317 align:middle line:90%
between my mother and father.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:34.722 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately my father was
a gambler on horses and cards.

00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:37.291 align:middle line:84%
So even the money
that he did make...

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:38.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.194 align:middle line:84%
>> ...he would gamble
it away, lose it,

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:42.463 align:middle line:90%
then end up in more debt.

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:44.331 align:middle line:84%
And so that created
a lot of tension...

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:47.735 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and a lot of,
not physical pain,

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:51.305 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of emotional pain
watching my parents just

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:90%
argue about...

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.174 align:middle line:90%
>> Specifically about money.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.744 align:middle line:84%
>> ...money and not having
enough and why was he doing that

00:02:56.744 --> 00:03:00.547 align:middle line:84%
and why -- why was his behavior
something he couldn't control.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:03.684 align:middle line:84%
And I really became
fascinated with, you know,

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:06.854 align:middle line:84%
behavior at a very young age
and then I was introduced

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:10.724 align:middle line:84%
to a wonderful mentor
who was kind and loving,

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:14.161 align:middle line:84%
and willing to -- to share his
knowledge and his experience,

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.297 align:middle line:84%
and his skills and his
strategies with me.

00:03:16.297 --> 00:03:20.868 align:middle line:84%
And he really gave me, for
the first time, when I was 19,

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:23.671 align:middle line:84%
an opening -- like, you
know, like a window opened

00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:25.673 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to just
get through the window...

00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:27.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.276 align:middle line:84%
>> ...to see a different way
of thinking, and believing,

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:32.279 align:middle line:84%
and behaving that had
transformed my life

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:33.213 align:middle line:90%
and it was such a gift.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.548 align:middle line:84%
>> But you have to
be able to walk

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:90%
through that opening though.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people will see it and
not know to walk through it.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
What do you think gave you that
ability to walk through that,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.059 align:middle line:90%
to take the coaching...

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.562 align:middle line:90%
>> ...to seek out the mentor?

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:54.735 align:middle line:84%
>> I think in a couple of words,
shame, guilt, and embarrassment.

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.003 align:middle line:90%
>> [Inaudible] to explain.

00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:00.574 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I felt less
than the other kids.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:05.012 align:middle line:84%
I felt ashamed at my
family's situation.

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:09.717 align:middle line:84%
I felt guilty that I wasn't able
to -- to help and contribute.

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:12.319 align:middle line:84%
When I was eight years
old I had a paper route.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.656 align:middle line:84%
I was delivering 100 newspapers
every morning even in the winter

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.992 align:middle line:84%
in Montreal and giving
some of that money

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.961 align:middle line:90%
to my mother and father to help.

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:23.097 align:middle line:84%
I worked at the local
dry cleaning store.

00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:26.433 align:middle line:84%
I worked at the local
pharmacy to make a little bit

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:30.037 align:middle line:84%
of extra money, 15 cents an
hour, 20 cents an hour just

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:32.139 align:middle line:84%
so we could have a
little bit extra,

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.274 align:middle line:84%
so that I could have a little
bit of money in my pocket...

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:35.476 --> 00:04:37.144 align:middle line:84%
>> ...but also to give
some money to my parents,

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:40.314 align:middle line:84%
to help pay for rent, to
help pay for some food.

00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:41.648 align:middle line:90%
But I felt embarrassed.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:42.783 align:middle line:90%
I felt ashamed.

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:45.853 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I wasn't as
good as the other kids

00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
who I thought didn't
have these problems.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I -- I felt that our problems
were confined, contained,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.528 align:middle line:90%
you know, to our household.

00:04:54.528 --> 00:04:55.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Just you.

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:56.663 align:middle line:90%
>> And as we all know, what --

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:59.833 align:middle line:84%
what people see versus
what the reality is,

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.102 align:middle line:90%
is often two different things.

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:05.739 align:middle line:84%
But I remember just
feeling that shame as a kid

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.909 align:middle line:84%
and when I had this
opportunity to learn from a man

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.211 align:middle line:90%
who was making a lot of money,

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:16.116 align:middle line:84%
was giving to philanthropic
endeavors, had a wonderful wife

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:18.285 align:middle line:84%
that he loved and adored,
and children, and --

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:21.722 align:middle line:84%
and an office, and teams of
people who respected him,

00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:23.924 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I want more of that.

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:28.395 align:middle line:84%
I want less of what I have and
had, and I want more of that."

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:29.496 align:middle line:90%
So I was ready.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I was in enough -- I
guess enough pain...

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.369 align:middle line:84%
>> ...you know, emotional
pain to say, "You know,

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:37.905 align:middle line:84%
your way looks like
it's the right path.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
The way that I've,
you know, been trained

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.041 align:middle line:84%
and taught is not
what I want more of

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.611 align:middle line:84%
and I certainly don't want
that for my children."

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:46.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:49.216 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was old enough to have
children, I was 19 at the time.

00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:50.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Looking down -- [laughter].

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.084 align:middle line:90%
>> I said I'm willing to --

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.854 align:middle line:84%
to learn and to try
something different.

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.923 align:middle line:84%
>> So you obviously weren't
afraid of hard work though.

00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:59.426 align:middle line:84%
You had a paper route at eight,
you were working at nine.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:00.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:02.796 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you got into
the situation with this guy

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:04.431 align:middle line:90%
and he was wonderful enough...

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> ...to take you
under his wing,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.236 align:middle line:84%
you busted your behind
didn't you [laughter]?

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:10.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the one thing
that I can share,

00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:13.974 align:middle line:84%
my father was a cab driver
and he woke up every morning

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:18.378 align:middle line:84%
at 5:00 a.m. was in his cab
at 5:30, worked really hard.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.247 align:middle line:84%
You know, he came home
at night, you know,

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:23.116 align:middle line:84%
for dinner then went back
out and worked, you know,

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.719 align:middle line:84%
his cab shift again, ended
up buying his own cab.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:31.124 align:middle line:84%
And I remember back in -- in
the '70s, he made like $22

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:35.529 align:middle line:84%
or $23,000, his best year
and he bought his own car,

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.866 align:middle line:84%
then he bought his
own license to --

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:41.935 align:middle line:84%
to have his own cab
instead of renting a cab.

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And he worked really hard and I
saw that he worked really hard.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
What I was taught in
addition to putting the time

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:55.282 align:middle line:84%
and the hours in, is there's
a level above working hard

00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:57.416 align:middle line:90%
and that's working smart.

00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:59.786 align:middle line:84%
And that's learning how
to do the right things

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:02.756 align:middle line:84%
in the right order
at the right time.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.391 align:middle line:90%
And what I've discovered

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:09.663 align:middle line:84%
in the last 30 plus years
is you can work hard,

00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:14.701 align:middle line:84%
but working smart beats working
hard every day of the week.

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:15.402 align:middle line:90%
>> This is true.

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:15.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:17.104 align:middle line:90%
>> This is true.

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:18.939 align:middle line:84%
It takes a long time to
really implement that.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:23.243 align:middle line:84%
You know, what I love about you,
John, is that you are self-made.

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:23.877 align:middle line:90%
You really are.

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:24.578 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of help.

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:25.779 align:middle line:90%
I've had a lot of help.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.349 align:middle line:84%
>> But you have come from
these adverse situations

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:31.351 align:middle line:84%
and circumstances,
and you have made

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
for yourself what we saw
you do in  The Secret

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.857 align:middle line:84%
where you put the picture of
the house that you were living

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:39.293 align:middle line:84%
in on your vision board
before you were living

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:39.726 align:middle line:90%
in it [chuckles].

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:40.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:41.895 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was phenomenal.

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:45.032 align:middle line:84%
I mean to be able to do what
you've done now is incredible.

00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:48.835 align:middle line:84%
So, tell us a little bit
about some of your Secrets

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:52.806 align:middle line:84%
of Success [chuckles] and how
you've applied Neuroscience

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.474 align:middle line:90%
to all of this.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.177 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first Secret of
Success and the first thing

00:07:57.177 --> 00:08:01.848 align:middle line:84%
that made -- I mean the biggest
difference in my world is,

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:04.418 align:middle line:84%
my brother introduced me to
this gentleman, Allen Brown,

00:08:04.418 --> 00:08:07.421 align:middle line:84%
who was the man who
became my first mentor.

00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:11.358 align:middle line:84%
And before he agreed to give
me his knowledge, his skills,

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:14.227 align:middle line:84%
his strategies that
he invested 30,

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:17.764 align:middle line:84%
40 years of his life learning
and millions of dollars

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:21.401 align:middle line:84%
of investments, he asked
me this one question.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.438 align:middle line:84%
And the question was,
"Are you interested

00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:27.541 align:middle line:84%
in becoming successful and
wealthy, not just financially,

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:32.445 align:middle line:84%
but in every area of your
life or are you committed

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:36.215 align:middle line:84%
to becoming successful in
each area of your life?"

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:40.253 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 19 and he
asked me the question, I said,

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:41.388 align:middle line:84%
"What's -- what's
the difference..."

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:42.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:43.657 align:middle line:90%
>> "...interest or commitment?"

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said -- he said, "If
you're interested you're going

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.428 align:middle line:90%
to come up with excuses.

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:90%
You're going to tell me stories.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.199 align:middle line:84%
You're going to tell
me why you can't,

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:90%
you know, do certain things.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.169 align:middle line:84%
You're going to believe
in your past.

00:08:56.169 --> 00:09:00.007 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel fear and
allow fear to control you.

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:02.109 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to want
to invest in yourself.

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.644 align:middle line:84%
You're going to want
to go out and party

00:09:03.644 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
at 19 years old instead
of upgrading your skills.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.516 align:middle line:84%
You're going to give me
stories, excuses, circumstance,

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:13.153 align:middle line:84%
and reasons why you can't,
or shouldn't, or won't."

00:09:13.153 --> 00:09:18.158 align:middle line:84%
He said, "That is not
the attitude of somebody

00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:21.261 align:middle line:84%
who is going to be
mega successful."

00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:24.698 align:middle line:84%
He says, "When you're
committed to something,

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:26.566 align:middle line:90%
there's no other option."

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.369 align:middle line:84%
He says, "The stories,
the excuses,

00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:34.273 align:middle line:84%
the circumstances all go
away and you focus all

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:37.778 align:middle line:84%
of your energy; your mental
energy, your spiritual energy,

00:09:37.778 --> 00:09:41.982 align:middle line:84%
your physical energy, all
of that gets realigned

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and refocused on how
I can, why I must,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.923 align:middle line:84%
and what will I do
every single day."

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:53.794 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me the
art of commitment,

00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:57.397 align:middle line:84%
then he taught me the
art of what I call today,

00:09:57.397 --> 00:10:01.101 align:middle line:90%
is fractional goal achievement.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow [laughter].

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:04.071 align:middle line:84%
>> So fractional
goal achievement,

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:05.772 align:middle line:84%
what's fractional
goal achievement?

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:06.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Fancy title.

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:10.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. A lot of
people set big goals

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:14.314 align:middle line:84%
and when they see these big
goals, they become overwhelmed

00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:17.084 align:middle line:84%
and they have this fear that
they're either not good enough,

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:19.686 align:middle line:84%
not smart enough, don't have the
skills, don't have the strategy,

00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:21.221 align:middle line:84%
don't have the people,
don't have the money.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.356 align:middle line:90%
>> How do I get there?

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:24.458 align:middle line:84%
>> And -- and then they
just become ingrained

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:27.294 align:middle line:84%
into that fear and
then they stop.

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:31.164 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me something
really, really valuable.

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:33.834 align:middle line:84%
He said, "We'll start
off with big goals,

00:10:33.834 --> 00:10:36.603 align:middle line:84%
but then what we're going
to do is just decide,

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:38.805 align:middle line:84%
"What are you going
to do today?"

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:43.877 align:middle line:84%
Three little things today
to move you towards that --

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:47.614 align:middle line:90%
not 30, not 300, three."

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:51.985 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me this
law of three that said,

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:55.989 align:middle line:84%
"Every day when you wake up,
all I want you to do is write

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:59.326 align:middle line:84%
down the three things
that you're going to do

00:10:59.326 --> 00:11:02.229 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
move you closer

00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:04.731 align:middle line:90%
to the goal that you want."

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.834 align:middle line:90%
So is that learning a new skill?

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that looking at your goals?

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.838 align:middle line:90%
Is that sitting there

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.841 align:middle line:84%
and mentally imagining
you already being there?

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.711 align:middle line:84%
Is that picking up the
phone and calling somebody?

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.346 align:middle line:90%
Is that going to a course?

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.281 align:middle line:90%
Just three things a day.

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.817 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:25.986 align:middle line:90%
or 10 because everybody...

00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:27.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's [inaudible].

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:29.489 align:middle line:84%
>> ... knows -- if -- if we look
at all the things that we have

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:31.758 align:middle line:90%
to do, it's overwhelming.

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:33.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:36.763 align:middle line:84%
>> And he know -- he knew
that if he could just get me

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:41.134 align:middle line:84%
into the habit of
doing my daily three,

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:46.973 align:middle line:84%
then the compounding effect over
the course of a week, 10 weeks,

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:50.377 align:middle line:84%
100 weeks, would send
my life and my results

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:54.047 align:middle line:84%
in a total different
trajectory and he just knew

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that I would achieve success
by doing the right things.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you still use the Law
of Attraction in your life?

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:03.723 align:middle line:84%
Do you still use that
in a different way now?

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.426 align:middle line:90%
Has it changed for you?

00:12:06.426 --> 00:12:08.461 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, my understanding
of the Law

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
of Attraction really
became even more deepened

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.169 align:middle line:90%
after  The Secret  came out.

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:19.673 align:middle line:84%
One of the major problems in
the movie,  The Secret  --

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:23.043 align:middle line:84%
and I love the movie, I love
the cast, I love what it did

00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:28.315 align:middle line:84%
for the world, is the premise
in  The Secret  was think,

00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:31.651 align:middle line:90%
believe, and you'll achieve.

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:34.821 align:middle line:84%
If you think about even
Napoleon Hill's book, " Think

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:36.289 align:middle line:90%
and Grow Rich ," it says,

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:40.227 align:middle line:84%
"You will become what
you think about most."

00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:43.597 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree with either the
think, believe, and achieve,

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:45.832 align:middle line:84%
or you will become what
you think about most.

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:47.033 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't?

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:51.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Nope. I believe that
if you think and believe,

00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:54.641 align:middle line:84%
and do the right things
in the right order

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:57.911 align:middle line:84%
at the right time,
you will achieve.

00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:59.613 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a formula
for success?

00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:00.881 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a formula.

00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:05.151 align:middle line:84%
There's this illusion or
delusion that people have

00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:08.355 align:middle line:84%
that if I let's say write my
goals down, I really believe...

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:09.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:10.891 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and I really have my
heart and soul they will happen.

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:12.225 align:middle line:90%
>> And visualize.

00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:15.028 align:middle line:84%
>> And then visualize it and
meditate, and sit, you know,

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:17.364 align:middle line:84%
with my -- my fingers
together like this

00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:22.168 align:middle line:84%
that somehow this magical
force in the universe is going

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:28.275 align:middle line:84%
to drop the success, the car,
the person, the money, what --

00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:31.278 align:middle line:84%
the relationship of your
dreams onto your lap.

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:36.983 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, is that
when you have the coherence

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:41.187 align:middle line:84%
of thinking the right thoughts,
believing that you deserve it,

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.856 align:middle line:90%
believing that it's possible...

00:13:42.856 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.092 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and then you come
up with the strategies,

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.995 align:middle line:84%
what could I be doing,
you know, to move that...

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:49.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Make it happen.

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:51.197 align:middle line:90%
>> ...forward, you know,

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
we're sitting here
in the studio, right.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.403 align:middle line:84%
There's preparation
that's gone into, you know,

00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:59.005 align:middle line:84%
into this interview,
into this exchange.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:00.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.474 align:middle line:84%
>> There's -- there's
people that are working,

00:14:01.474 --> 00:14:04.377 align:middle line:84%
doing their job to put the
things in the right order.

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:05.745 align:middle line:90%
There's timelines.

00:14:05.745 --> 00:14:07.781 align:middle line:84%
There's investments
that were made.

00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:10.617 align:middle line:84%
There was skills and strategies
that you've had to learn,

00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:11.351 align:middle line:90%
that I've had to learn.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:12.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> People that are
helping film and edit,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.056 align:middle line:90%
and record have had to learn.

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:19.259 align:middle line:84%
And nobody's there saying,
"Well I hope that magically,

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:22.295 align:middle line:90%
you know, this show appears."

00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:24.597 align:middle line:84%
>> [Chuckles] Interesting
because I mean I have --

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:26.366 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking as
you were talking,

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
things have magically appeared
in my life a few times,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:34.174 align:middle line:84%
but if I think about it,
they really did have a lot

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:37.711 align:middle line:84%
of consideration and planning,
and different circumstances had

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.579 align:middle line:84%
to fall into place
for those to happen.

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:44.818 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when -- when we're
on the same frequency...

00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:46.052 align:middle line:90%
>> In coherence, yes, yes...

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.854 align:middle line:84%
>> ...when we're on the
same frequency, if you think

00:14:47.854 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
about when you're tuning
into a radio station,

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.261 align:middle line:84%
if you tune into let's say
jazz, what you hear is jazz.

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:58.331 align:middle line:84%
If you tune into classical,
what you hear is classical.

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:02.469 align:middle line:84%
If you all of a sudden combine,
you know, classical and rock

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:06.272 align:middle line:84%
and roll, you have half of each
station all you have is noise...

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> [Inaudible].

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.743 align:middle line:84%
>> ...you'd have this sound
that you wouldn't want to hear.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, part of
achieving success is getting

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
that coherence and when
you're in coherence,

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.187 align:middle line:84%
when you are certain about the
outcome you want to achieve,

00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:24.958 align:middle line:84%
when you really have this
feeling inside that you believe

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.826 align:middle line:84%
that you can do it,
that you deserve it,

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:29.162 align:middle line:84%
that you're good enough,
that you're smart enough,

00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:34.801 align:middle line:84%
that you can find the solutions,
and you develop the path

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
on the way to achieving
that goal,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:42.308 align:middle line:84%
what you find coincidentally
are other people

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:45.845 align:middle line:84%
who are also listening to that
same station on that same path.

00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:47.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:52.752 align:middle line:84%
>> The definition of coincidence
is when two angles coincide.

00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:57.057 align:middle line:84%
So while you're on your path and
other people are on their path,

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:59.659 align:middle line:84%
and you're on the sane
coherent frequency...

00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.428 align:middle line:90%
>> It's kind of like, "Oh wow."

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:02.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Intentional, right.

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:03.797 align:middle line:90%
>> It's intentional.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.799 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to learn
about some of these tips

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:90%
and tools that you teach.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.501 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:11.504 align:middle line:84%
>> I -- I first want you to take
a look at what John shows just

00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to really set the stage
in what he teaches.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.709 align:middle line:90%

>> It sets the stage for what
we're going to learn here.

00:17:40.593 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle line:90%
So we talked about coincidence.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:45.565 align:middle line:84%
We talked about things lining
up, coherence, intention.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.067 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned at the beginning,

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:51.271 align:middle line:84%
we know all of those
things, but we need the why.

00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Why is that so important
and then we're going

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.275 align:middle line:90%
to get into the details.

00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:58.411 align:middle line:90%
But why is the why so important?

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:04.217 align:middle line:84%
>> When you think about life,
everybody has challenges

00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:07.687 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has mornings they
don't want to get out of bed

00:18:07.687 --> 00:18:10.256 align:middle line:84%
and we have occurrences
that are just not

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.092 align:middle line:84%
to our taste, and
things go wrong.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:14.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.196 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean when we look at --
what does success look like?

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:19.199 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think that
success looks like, "Here I am

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:22.168 align:middle line:84%
and then it's a straight
line up to here."

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:23.369 align:middle line:90%
>> [Laughter] Yeah.

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:25.638 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do all
successful people really know,

00:18:25.638 --> 00:18:28.641 align:middle line:84%
that success goes like
this; up, down, left, right,

00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:30.877 align:middle line:90%
back down, left right, up down.

00:18:30.877 --> 00:18:32.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at a stock,
yeah [laughter].

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:36.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly and so when
we talk about the why,

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:38.651 align:middle line:84%
my personal belief
is that every one

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:41.087 align:middle line:84%
of us has a reason
why we're here.

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:44.123 align:middle line:84%
So there's something that
we're supposed to do here.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:49.562 align:middle line:84%
There's a -- a piece of
knowledge, a product, a service,

00:18:49.562 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
a gift that we're here
to deliver to the world

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.669 align:middle line:84%
to make the world
a better place,

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:59.806 align:middle line:84%
but also to give our
lives more meaning,

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:03.076 align:middle line:84%
more purpose, and
more fulfillment.

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:07.814 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about like why
are you doing what you're doing,

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.617 align:middle line:84%
once you get past because
I need to pay my mortgage

00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:11.784 align:middle line:90%
or my rent, I need to eat.

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:12.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:13.853 align:middle line:90%
>> I need to feed my children...

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:14.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:17.257 align:middle line:84%
>> ...what happens
when times get tough

00:19:17.257 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and I promise every
person they will.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:24.831 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're why isn't
bigger than just yourself,

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:29.135 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have a bigger
social or moral purpose,

00:19:29.135 --> 00:19:34.307 align:middle line:84%
if you can't see that the
person that you're helping,

00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that
you're helping them with,

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
also effects their
children, effects their --

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.951 align:middle line:84%
the dry cleaner that they get
their clothes dry cleaned at,

00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:48.187 align:middle line:84%
or the grocery store that
they buy their food from,

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:53.559 align:middle line:84%
or how they fit into
the whole of humanity,

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:56.396 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have
enough leverage

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:59.799 align:middle line:90%
to get past your own challenges.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:03.503 align:middle line:84%
>> So if someone wants to change
their financial, you know,

00:20:03.503 --> 00:20:07.607 align:middle line:84%
income and say make $100,000
more a year and they put things

00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
into place in order to make
that happen, you're saying

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.212 align:middle line:90%
that if they don't have the --

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:17.784 align:middle line:84%
the real emotional reason as
to why that money is important,

00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:19.986 align:middle line:90%
it pretty much won't appear.

00:20:19.986 --> 00:20:22.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they won't
have the motivation.

00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:25.725 align:middle line:84%
And I want to break the word
"motivation" into two things;

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:28.461 align:middle line:90%
the motive for action.

00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:29.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:33.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Right? So what is your
motive to take action

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.034 align:middle line:90%
when you don't feel like it?

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:37.737 align:middle line:84%
What's your motive
to take action

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.839 align:middle line:84%
when you're just
having a lousy day?

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:41.941 align:middle line:84%
What's your motive
to take action

00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:45.111 align:middle line:84%
when things aren't working the
way you expected them to work?

00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:46.979 align:middle line:84%
>> You go back to
default patterns.

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:50.016 align:middle line:84%
>> You go back to default
patterns and if it's only you

00:20:50.016 --> 00:20:52.051 align:middle line:84%
that you're thinking
about or if it's --

00:20:52.051 --> 00:20:54.654 align:middle line:84%
it's only your immediate
family you're thinking about,

00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that might be one
level of motivation,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.327 align:middle line:84%
but when you can go
beyond your own motivation,

00:21:01.327 --> 00:21:04.897 align:middle line:84%
when you can say, "Hey
if I don't get up,

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:08.234 align:middle line:84%
then I'm affecting five,
10, 20, 50 other people,

00:21:08.234 --> 00:21:12.772 align:middle line:84%
100 other people or affecting
five, 10, 50, 100 other people,"

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:18.144 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the
leverage to be selfless.

00:21:18.144 --> 00:21:21.848 align:middle line:84%
So when you come up with
a big enough why you tend

00:21:21.848 --> 00:21:23.216 align:middle line:84%
to do the things you
don't want to do.

00:21:23.216 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:90%
So imagine this.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we set a goal, any
goal, whether it was to be

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.822 align:middle line:84%
in the best physical
shape of our lives,

00:21:29.822 --> 00:21:34.627 align:middle line:84%
to make an extra $3,000 or
$2,000 or $10,000 a month

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:39.532 align:middle line:84%
and imagine if I said to you,
"If you don't achieve that goal

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:45.538 align:middle line:84%
by a year from now, you will
never see the person you love

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:48.341 align:middle line:90%
the most in the world."

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:49.742 --> 00:21:51.611 align:middle line:84%
>> All of a sudden, the way you
would think would be different.

00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:52.512 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden...

00:21:52.512 --> 00:21:53.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:53.746 --> 00:21:54.914 align:middle line:84%
>> ...who you would ask for
help would be different.

00:21:54.914 --> 00:21:56.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.585 align:middle line:84%
>> All of a sudden if you had
a lousy day, you'd go, "Uh-oh,

00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:02.388 align:middle line:84%
if I don't use today to move
forward towards achieving

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:04.824 align:middle line:84%
that goal, I'm possibly
not going to see

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.492 align:middle line:90%
that person that I love."

00:22:06.492 --> 00:22:10.496 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about why,
we're actually looking

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:84%
for bigger leverage points
for ourselves not just

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.503 align:middle line:84%
to keep us motivated
when everything's okay,

00:22:17.503 --> 00:22:23.176 align:middle line:84%
but to keep us motivated and in
action when things don't work

00:22:23.176 --> 00:22:25.578 align:middle line:84%
out the way that
we want them to.

00:22:25.578 --> 00:22:26.979 align:middle line:90%
>> That changes the game.

00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:27.713 align:middle line:90%
>> It changes the game.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:29.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Completely, yes.

00:22:29.115 --> 00:22:32.919 align:middle line:84%
>> And -- and so whenever
we help people set goals,

00:22:32.919 --> 00:22:36.923 align:middle line:84%
one of the main parts of
setting a goal is asking,

00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:38.624 align:middle line:84%
"Why do you want
to achieve that?"

00:22:38.624 --> 00:22:39.959 align:middle line:90%
And usually people say, "Well,

00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:42.261 align:middle line:84%
it's because we want
financial freedom."

00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:43.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:43.563 --> 00:22:44.831 align:middle line:84%
>> And we say, "Well why do
you want to achieve that?"

00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:46.432 align:middle line:84%
"Well, because we
-- we don't want

00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:90%
to have the stress in our life."

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:50.102 align:middle line:84%
>> We say, "Well, great why
do want to achieve that?"

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:52.705 align:middle line:84%
"So, like we can have
some calmness and peace."

00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:55.541 align:middle line:84%
And we say, "Well, why would
you want to achieve that?"

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:57.977 align:middle line:84%
So if we can go deeper,
and deeper, and deeper,

00:22:57.977 --> 00:23:01.747 align:middle line:84%
into the why, then we
could start to come

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
up with reasons beyond
ourselves.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.319 align:middle line:84%
And in all of the
research by the way,

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:10.223 align:middle line:84%
around what people want most,
when you initially ask people,

00:23:10.223 --> 00:23:13.392 align:middle line:84%

00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:58.257 align:middle line:84%
and if it gets --
yeah, so how do you do

00:30:58.257 --> 00:30:59.959 align:middle line:90%
that when it comes to money?

00:30:59.959 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there's something

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.897 align:middle line:84%
that brain research
called Automaticity.

00:31:04.897 --> 00:31:08.267 align:middle line:84%
And Automaticity
is our designer,

00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:14.239 align:middle line:84%
God's way of taking anything
that we have repeatedly heard,

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:17.943 align:middle line:84%
or done, or experienced over,
and over, and over again,

00:31:17.943 --> 00:31:21.647 align:middle line:84%
and it's made automatic so we
don't have to think about it.

00:31:21.647 --> 00:31:24.249 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
a thermostat, you know,

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:25.818 align:middle line:84%
in the room that we're
sitting in right now,

00:31:25.818 --> 00:31:27.686 align:middle line:90%
there's a set thermostat.

00:31:27.686 --> 00:31:30.522 align:middle line:84%
Okay, a set temperature
that the thermostat is on,

00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:33.258 align:middle line:84%
any time that there's either
heat or cold air that would come

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:36.695 align:middle line:84%
into this room, it would send
a signal to the wiring system

00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:38.263 align:middle line:90%
for the furnace, to either turn

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:41.133 align:middle line:84%
up the air conditioning
or turn on the heat.

00:31:41.133 --> 00:31:43.902 align:middle line:84%
That's called a cybernetic
mechanism.

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:47.506 align:middle line:84%
Well, every single person
has set points whether it's a

00:31:47.506 --> 00:31:50.876 align:middle line:84%
financial set point,
relationship set point,

00:31:50.876 --> 00:31:53.879 align:middle line:84%
health set point, weight
set point, etcetera,

00:31:53.879 --> 00:31:56.715 align:middle line:84%
and if we follow that
pattern over and over again,

00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:58.851 align:middle line:90%
it just becomes automatic.

00:31:58.851 --> 00:32:05.257 align:middle line:84%
And so what people don't
understand is unless you rewire

00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:09.962 align:middle line:84%
the set point, what's actually
causing most of the perceptions,

00:32:09.962 --> 00:32:14.533 align:middle line:84%
thought patterns, and behaviors
that keep you at that level,

00:32:14.533 --> 00:32:17.536 align:middle line:84%
you end up with more of the
same every week, every month,

00:32:17.536 --> 00:32:19.138 align:middle line:90%
every quarter, every year.

00:32:19.138 --> 00:32:21.206 align:middle line:84%
>> So you make the same
amount of money over and over,

00:32:21.206 --> 00:32:24.009 align:middle line:84%
you go on the same types --
a couple of vacations a year

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:27.112 align:middle line:84%
or not, or -- I mean you
just do that consistently...

00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:28.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:30.315 align:middle line:84%
>> ...until something
burning inside

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:32.317 align:middle line:90%
of you desires you to change it.

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:37.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there -- the first
part is to recognize that most

00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:39.625 align:middle line:90%
of what we're thinking about,

00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:43.195 align:middle line:84%
most of what we're doing
is just a repetition

00:32:43.195 --> 00:32:45.297 align:middle line:84%
of what we've been
thinking about and doing

00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:84%
for a year, five
years, 10 years.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.104 align:middle line:84%
If you ask yourself, "Are you
in the same place you are today

00:32:52.104 --> 00:32:54.339 align:middle line:90%
as you were five years ago?"

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Most people would say,
"More or less the same."

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.745 align:middle line:84%
There's a few things
that have changed...

00:32:59.745 --> 00:33:01.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:01.046 --> 00:33:03.482 align:middle line:84%
>> ...but most people don't
have serious jumps, okay,

00:33:03.482 --> 00:33:05.818 align:middle line:84%
in their weight and
serious weight losses.

00:33:05.818 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't have
serious jumps in their income

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.057 align:middle line:84%
or serious losses under
normal circumstances.

00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:14.827 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can argue that
based on the economy

00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:16.128 align:middle line:90%
and certain circumstances.

00:33:16.128 --> 00:33:19.865 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
we have these set points,

00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:90%
okay, that we're used to.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.404 align:middle line:84%
People who had a lot of money
before the recession have been

00:33:25.404 --> 00:33:27.973 align:middle line:90%
busting their behinds to get...

00:33:27.973 --> 00:33:28.674 align:middle line:90%
>> To get back there.

00:33:28.674 --> 00:33:29.374 align:middle line:90%
>> ...back their money.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:30.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:30.676 --> 00:33:32.945 align:middle line:84%
>> People who didn't have
any money, they're really --

00:33:32.945 --> 00:33:35.214 align:middle line:84%
you know, nothing's
changed for them, you know.

00:33:35.214 --> 00:33:39.885 align:middle line:84%
And so what the brain is
supposed to do; number one,

00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:42.287 align:middle line:84%
is to look for things
that are pleasurable.

00:33:42.287 --> 00:33:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So we look to set
goals and we look to,

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:45.991 align:middle line:90%
you know, to look better.

00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:48.527 align:middle line:84%
We look at TV ads or
-- or pictures and say,

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:49.795 align:middle line:90%
"Oh God, I'd love that."

00:33:49.795 --> 00:33:52.664 align:middle line:84%
And that's because it
makes the brain feel good.

00:33:52.664 --> 00:33:53.465 align:middle line:90%
>> To improve.

00:33:53.465 --> 00:33:54.066 align:middle line:90%
>> To improve.

00:33:54.066 --> 00:33:55.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:58.604 align:middle line:84%
>> But the other part of the
brain is keeping us stuck

00:33:58.604 --> 00:34:02.374 align:middle line:84%
at a certain level of income,
at a certain relationship,

00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:05.477 align:middle line:84%
at a certain weight,
at a certain everything

00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:08.881 align:middle line:84%
because it's role is
to conserve energy

00:34:08.881 --> 00:34:11.650 align:middle line:90%
and maintain comfort zones.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.754 align:middle line:84%
So if anything is
risky, fearful,

00:34:15.754 --> 00:34:19.358 align:middle line:84%
potentially harmful
to us, it says what?

00:34:19.358 --> 00:34:23.327 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's going to take
too much energy to change

00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:26.131 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going to
stay in my comfort zone

00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:28.233 align:middle line:84%
and just keep doing
what I'm always doing.

00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:30.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the change will
threaten the survival?

00:34:30.736 --> 00:34:36.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. As soon as we
have to take upon anything

00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:40.912 align:middle line:84%
that requires brain
power, the brain says...

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:42.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Additional brainpower.

00:34:42.514 --> 00:34:45.717 align:middle line:84%
>> ..."No, I'm a
conservation machine,

00:34:45.717 --> 00:34:48.519 align:middle line:84%
not an energy expenditure
machine."

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:50.856 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to call the
brain a machine but from a...

00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:51.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:52.324 align:middle line:90%
>> ...the way it works...

00:34:52.324 --> 00:34:53.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:34:53.158 --> 00:34:55.126 align:middle line:90%
>> ...is conservation of energy.

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:57.129 align:middle line:84%
Look for things that
are pleasurable,

00:34:57.129 --> 00:35:01.166 align:middle line:84%
eliminate anything that's
risky, fearful, or dangerous.

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when we say, "I want to
go from this amount of income

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.039 align:middle line:84%
to that amount of
income," all of a sudden,

00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:09.074 align:middle line:90%
we have to change what we think.

00:35:09.074 --> 00:35:11.276 align:middle line:84%
We might have to learn
some new knowledge.

00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:13.278 align:middle line:84%
We might have to
upgrade our skills.

00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:16.515 align:middle line:84%
We might have to go
through repetition, okay,

00:35:16.515 --> 00:35:18.317 align:middle line:90%
which actually takes work.

00:35:18.317 --> 00:35:19.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:35:19.651 --> 00:35:24.189 align:middle line:84%
>> And most people are not
willing to pay the switch cost,

00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:84%
the cost between where they are
and the discomfort of change.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the cost of the comfort,

00:35:32.764 --> 00:35:35.033 align:middle line:84%
the cost of your
personal comfort zone.

00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:36.301 align:middle line:90%
>> You got it.

00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:39.338 align:middle line:84%
So we call that the switch
cost, switching from this

00:35:39.338 --> 00:35:42.207 align:middle line:84%
to that takes energy,
takes effort,

00:35:42.207 --> 00:35:44.176 align:middle line:90%
takes being uncomfortable,

00:35:44.176 --> 00:35:46.712 align:middle line:84%
and we're not wired
to be uncomfortable.

00:35:46.712 --> 00:35:47.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:48.547 align:middle line:90%
>> We're not wired to do that.

00:35:48.547 --> 00:35:50.082 align:middle line:84%
>> No, we're wired
to be comfortable.

00:35:50.082 --> 00:35:54.319 align:middle line:84%
>> We're wired for automaticity,
for conservation of energy.

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:55.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:55.287 --> 00:35:57.322 align:middle line:84%
>> So we don't mind
setting goals.

00:35:57.322 --> 00:35:59.691 align:middle line:84%
We don't even mind
reading books.

00:35:59.691 --> 00:36:02.894 align:middle line:84%
But when you think about how
much knowledge do you really

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:05.097 align:middle line:90%
gain from reading a book?

00:36:05.097 --> 00:36:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't gain a lot of
knowledge, you gain awareness.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.168 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:12.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Right? It's only through
the studying, the repetition,

00:36:12.371 --> 00:36:14.206 align:middle line:84%
the application of
the information...

00:36:14.206 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually doing it.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> ...it's a book, a CD,
a program that you go

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:23.515 align:middle line:84%
through that allows you to
create the neuro pathway

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:27.686 align:middle line:84%
and the receptivity
for change to happen.

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:32.624 align:middle line:84%
What most people are not
aware of are the signals

00:36:32.624 --> 00:36:37.296 align:middle line:84%
that their body is giving
them, warning them --

00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:39.264 align:middle line:84%
okay, like for example,
if something's wrong

00:36:39.264 --> 00:36:42.901 align:middle line:84%
in your engine, our cars today
will have a light that pops up.

00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:45.437 align:middle line:84%
Our new cars will have
a light that pops up.

00:36:45.437 --> 00:36:46.705 align:middle line:90%
Well, most people, you know,

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:49.041 align:middle line:84%
don't take a hammer
and hit the light.

00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:49.841 align:middle line:90%
>> Right [laughter].

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:51.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay, most will go, "Huh.

00:36:51.176 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a light, a signal
that's come up on my dashboard.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.216 align:middle line:84%
Let me take out to the
mechanic to see what's going on.

00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:00.552 align:middle line:84%
Let me open up the hood,
look underneath the hood

00:37:00.552 --> 00:37:02.387 align:middle line:84%
to see what's causing
the light."

00:37:02.387 --> 00:37:03.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:03.522 --> 00:37:07.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when we have
these emotions of doubt,

00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:09.027 align:middle line:90%
these feelings of fear...

00:37:09.027 --> 00:37:10.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Fear.

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:12.064 align:middle line:84%
>> ...when we have
these emotions of guilt,

00:37:12.064 --> 00:37:16.668 align:middle line:84%
or of being embarrassed, or
ashamed, these are signals

00:37:16.668 --> 00:37:22.341 align:middle line:84%
that something in the
engine, okay, is triggering.

00:37:22.341 --> 00:37:24.409 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't take the time

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:28.213 align:middle line:84%
to recognize why is
this feeling here?

00:37:28.213 --> 00:37:30.582 align:middle line:90%
What's causing this feeling?

00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:35.954 align:middle line:84%
Why do I want to revert back to
my old self, my old thinking?

00:37:35.954 --> 00:37:41.560 align:middle line:84%
What's that compelling pull-back
feature that everybody has?

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.932 align:middle line:84%
And so, one of the first keys to
any growth, any financial growth

00:37:46.932 --> 00:37:52.704 align:middle line:84%
or any type of growth, is
to recognize the emotions,

00:37:52.704 --> 00:37:58.744 align:middle line:84%
the feelings, the
thoughts, the body sensations

00:37:58.744 --> 00:38:02.247 align:middle line:90%
that feel uncomfortable.

00:38:02.247 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Most people feel
that discomfort...

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:38:06.318 --> 00:38:07.652 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and they move
away from it.

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, they run from
it and out from it, yes.

00:38:09.855 --> 00:38:12.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Right. But if we
think about this,

00:38:12.491 --> 00:38:16.695 align:middle line:84%
how does a firefighter
learn to run into...

00:38:16.695 --> 00:38:17.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:19.297 align:middle line:84%
>> ...a fire when
everybody else's running out?

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Running out, yeah.

00:38:20.999 --> 00:38:22.334 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they start off

00:38:22.334 --> 00:38:25.937 align:middle line:84%
by teaching them,
okay, how fires work.

00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:28.206 align:middle line:84%
You know, the fires
require oxygen.

00:38:28.206 --> 00:38:31.576 align:middle line:84%
What causes them, you
know, to gain momentum?

00:38:31.576 --> 00:38:33.578 align:middle line:90%
What causes them to dissipate?

00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:36.348 align:middle line:84%
And they start off
with little fires

00:38:36.348 --> 00:38:39.751 align:middle line:84%
and they learn the basics
and the fundamentals.

00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, with some knowledge,
some skills, some application...

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:46.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Practice.

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:49.261 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and practice, they
start to upgrade their level

00:38:49.261 --> 00:38:53.498 align:middle line:84%
of awareness, confidence,
and certainty.

00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:56.068 align:middle line:84%
And when you raise your level
of awareness and confidence

00:38:56.068 --> 00:39:01.973 align:middle line:84%
and certainty, instead of
reacting, you learn to respond.

00:39:01.973 --> 00:39:04.443 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you have that
picture that you put

00:39:04.443 --> 00:39:07.546 align:middle line:84%
on your vision board of
the house that you wanted,

00:39:07.546 --> 00:39:11.283 align:middle line:84%
did you have any idea how
you were going to get that?

00:39:11.283 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.351 align:middle line:90%
>> No idea?

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:16.988 align:middle line:84%
>> As a matter of fact, when I
used to look at that picture,

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:20.492 align:middle line:84%
I mean the only relationship
to that picture

00:39:20.492 --> 00:39:23.762 align:middle line:84%
that I had was watching
Lifestyles of the Rich

00:39:23.762 --> 00:39:25.497 align:middle line:90%
and Famous with Robin Leach.

00:39:25.497 --> 00:39:26.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:29.534 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was taught
something different though.

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:33.438 align:middle line:84%
You see, when most
people look at a picture

00:39:33.438 --> 00:39:36.775 align:middle line:84%
of the home they want, or the
spouse that they'd like to have,

00:39:36.775 --> 00:39:40.345 align:middle line:84%
or the car, or the charity they
want to, you know, help support,

00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:42.848 align:middle line:84%
or the school they
want to help build,

00:39:42.848 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:90%
because they don't know how,

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.554 align:middle line:84%
that triggers a fear
response in their brain.

00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:51.957 align:middle line:84%
And the fear response
says, "Well,

00:39:51.957 --> 00:39:52.958 align:middle line:90%
you don't know how to do this.

00:39:52.958 --> 00:39:54.025 align:middle line:90%
You don't know the strategies.

00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:54.693 align:middle line:90%
You don't know the tactics."

00:39:54.693 --> 00:39:55.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:55.527 --> 00:39:56.094 align:middle line:90%
>> "You're not smart enough."

00:39:56.094 --> 00:39:56.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>> "You're not good enough."

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.165 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that happens,
it actually will shut

00:40:00.165 --> 00:40:03.602 align:middle line:84%
down the genius part
of your brain

00:40:03.602 --> 00:40:06.471 align:middle line:84%
which we now know is the
left-prefrontal cortex.

00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:10.709 align:middle line:84%
The part of your brain that
is able to imagine solutions,

00:40:10.709 --> 00:40:12.177 align:middle line:90%
"Well, maybe I can do this."

00:40:12.177 --> 00:40:12.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:40:12.944 --> 00:40:14.212 align:middle line:90%
>> "Maybe I could do that.

00:40:14.212 --> 00:40:15.947 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I could get some help.

00:40:15.947 --> 00:40:19.184 align:middle line:84%
Who could I find that
might have this knowledge?"

00:40:19.184 --> 00:40:21.319 align:middle line:84%
What most people
do or what happens

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:23.989 align:middle line:84%
to most people is they look
at something they want,

00:40:23.989 --> 00:40:27.192 align:middle line:84%
and they set a goal that they
want, and the first thing

00:40:27.192 --> 00:40:30.962 align:middle line:84%
that our brain does, is it
goes into the memory banks

00:40:30.962 --> 00:40:35.066 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and it
remembers another time --

00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:38.937 align:middle line:84%
or two or 10 or 100
where you set a goal

00:40:38.937 --> 00:40:40.872 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you haven't
achieved it.

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:42.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:42.274 --> 00:40:44.743 align:middle line:84%
>> And it brings all of those
memories into the present moment

00:40:44.743 --> 00:40:51.683 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and then you
feel the memory of the past

00:40:51.683 --> 00:40:53.018 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:40:53.018 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:90%
But that's not where it stops.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Your brain then moves to
the right prefrontal cortex

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:03.595 align:middle line:84%
and projects into the future
all the potential danger

00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:06.698 align:middle line:90%
and risk and emotional pain.

00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:10.035 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think
about a dot --

00:41:10.035 --> 00:41:14.339 align:middle line:84%
a point, imagine arriving at
a point and if you go right,

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:17.676 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be a
negative experience.

00:41:17.676 --> 00:41:20.412 align:middle line:84%
If you go left, it's going
to be a -- an experience...

00:41:20.412 --> 00:41:21.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Positive.

00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:23.315 align:middle line:84%
>> ...a possibility
and positivity.

00:41:23.315 --> 00:41:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Most people haven't
been taught to A --

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:30.655 align:middle line:84%
recognize that point where the
emotion is telling you there's

00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:34.659 align:middle line:84%
something dangerous, or fearful,
or potentially risky for you.

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:37.629 align:middle line:84%
Most people feel that
and automatically,

00:41:37.629 --> 00:41:42.167 align:middle line:84%
they go to the default setting
of fear, risk, danger, and pain.

00:41:42.167 --> 00:41:43.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:41:43.635 --> 00:41:47.072 align:middle line:84%
>> But through awareness
of, "Here's the light

00:41:47.072 --> 00:41:50.342 align:middle line:84%
that just got triggered
within me,"

00:41:50.342 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:84%
now I can choose to
override my past.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.218 align:middle line:84%
I can now choose to
respond by saying, "Hold on.

00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:01.386 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling.

00:42:01.386 --> 00:42:02.621 align:middle line:90%
It's not reality.

00:42:02.621 --> 00:42:04.656 align:middle line:90%
It's a potential reality."

00:42:04.656 --> 00:42:09.027 align:middle line:84%
But let's say I go to the
left prefrontal cortex

00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:12.364 align:middle line:84%
and I use the part of my
brain that allows me to come

00:42:12.364 --> 00:42:13.465 align:middle line:90%
up with possibilities.

00:42:13.465 --> 00:42:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Imaginative, creative
possibility.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.469 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine -- so,
who can I call?

00:42:17.469 --> 00:42:18.403 align:middle line:90%
Who can I talk to?

00:42:18.403 --> 00:42:19.337 align:middle line:90%
What could I read?

00:42:19.337 --> 00:42:20.472 align:middle line:90%
What could I search on Google?

00:42:20.472 --> 00:42:21.506 align:middle line:84%
>> How can I look
at this differently?

00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:22.641 align:middle line:84%
>> How can I look
at this differently

00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:23.942 align:middle line:90%
and go down that path...

00:42:23.942 --> 00:42:25.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yes.

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:28.313 align:middle line:84%
>> ...not react, okay,
versus going down the path

00:42:28.313 --> 00:42:33.184 align:middle line:84%
of automatic, okay,
automatic desire

00:42:33.184 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:90%
to avoid pain and any risk?

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.423 align:middle line:84%
>> This is why tools
and techniques that come

00:42:38.423 --> 00:42:40.392 align:middle line:84%
from your research
and background are

00:42:40.392 --> 00:42:41.393 align:middle line:90%
so completely helpful.

00:42:41.393 --> 00:42:42.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:42:42.093 --> 00:42:43.495 align:middle line:90%
>> And I love learning.

00:42:43.495 --> 00:42:46.131 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to take another
video with tools and techniques

00:42:46.131 --> 00:42:48.133 align:middle line:90%
and specifics of goal setting.

00:42:48.133 --> 00:42:49.234 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:42:49.234 --> 00:42:53.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is where I see
that most people get

00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:57.308 align:middle line:84%
into a challenging,
challenging time.

00:42:57.308 --> 00:43:03.815 align:middle line:84%
They have horrific, terrible
habits around strategies,

00:43:03.815 --> 00:43:06.918 align:middle line:84%
tactics, and process
to achieve their goals.

00:43:06.918 --> 00:43:10.588 align:middle line:84%
And so, they don't
have the consistency,

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:16.061 align:middle line:84%
or the right habits, or
daily rituals of two things.

00:43:16.061 --> 00:43:21.366 align:middle line:84%
Number one; they don't have
the daily rituals of thinking

00:43:21.366 --> 00:43:24.602 align:middle line:84%
about their goals
on a daily basis.

00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:28.707 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may think about why
does that make any difference.

00:43:28.707 --> 00:43:30.675 align:middle line:84%
Well, it makes all the
difference in the world

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:34.546 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as you
develop the habit to focus

00:43:34.546 --> 00:43:37.982 align:middle line:84%
on what you've written
down as a goal,

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:42.654 align:middle line:84%
you're creating a neurological
pattern, almost a map

00:43:42.654 --> 00:43:46.391 align:middle line:90%
of your new goal in your brain.

00:43:46.391 --> 00:43:50.261 align:middle line:84%
And then your brain starts to
see things in the physical world

00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:90%
that match up with the goal.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Most people never
write their goals down

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.669 align:middle line:90%
and that is problem number two.

00:43:57.669 --> 00:44:00.271 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the second
biggest mistakes people make.

00:44:00.271 --> 00:44:02.507 align:middle line:84%
They don't take the time
to write it down clearly

00:44:02.507 --> 00:44:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and precisely, and so they
think that they have some goals,

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.812 align:middle line:84%
or they write it
down once or twice

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:09.514 align:middle line:90%
and they never look at it again.

00:44:09.514 --> 00:44:11.916 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the biggest
fundamental mistakes,

00:44:11.916 --> 00:44:14.419 align:middle line:90%
number two, that people make.

00:44:14.419 --> 00:44:17.956 align:middle line:84%
What I want you to do is I want
you to write your goals down

00:44:17.956 --> 00:44:21.559 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to develop
a plan, a little blueprint.

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:26.931 align:middle line:84%
Think about this, if you were to
get on an airplane and you want

00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:30.568 align:middle line:84%
to go from where you live
right now and you want to go

00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:33.805 align:middle line:90%
across the ocean somewhere.

00:44:33.805 --> 00:44:37.909 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you demand that first
you have the destination,

00:44:37.909 --> 00:44:40.979 align:middle line:84%
the goal, and then
secondly, that the pilot

00:44:40.979 --> 00:44:43.715 align:middle line:84%
and the airline would
have the strategy for how

00:44:43.715 --> 00:44:45.650 align:middle line:84%
to get you there, the
tactics how to get you there,

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:49.487 align:middle line:84%
and the process to make sure
that everything was safe?

00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:52.157 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't you want them
to have the habits of going

00:44:52.157 --> 00:44:55.226 align:middle line:84%
through this checklist
and focusing on exactly

00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:57.228 align:middle line:90%
where they wanted to get you to

00:44:57.228 --> 00:45:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and what the process
was every single time?

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.937 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I found is most
people don't have the right

00:45:05.937 --> 00:45:08.873 align:middle line:90%
daily habits or rituals

00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:10.942 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the goals
that they want.

00:45:10.942 --> 00:45:12.744 align:middle line:90%
They have hopes and dreams

00:45:12.744 --> 00:45:17.081 align:middle line:84%
but they're also
locked in a habit loop.

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:20.485 align:middle line:84%
And a habit loop is something
that you just get accustomed

00:45:20.485 --> 00:45:22.720 align:middle line:90%
to doing every single day.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.559 align:middle line:84%
Now, for the most part, yours
and my brain is really lazy.

00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:29.861 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you
that know my work,

00:45:29.861 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm all around the neuro
science of maxi achiever,

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:36.501 align:middle line:84%
the neuro science of how do we
get people to think differently?

00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:84%
How do we get people
to behave differently

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:43.775 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly, how do we
get people to create the habits

00:45:43.775 --> 00:45:47.412 align:middle line:84%
that are duplicatable and
replicatable every single day?

00:45:47.412 --> 00:45:49.914 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I can share with you based

00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:53.718 align:middle line:84%
on the latest neuro science
research is that the habits

00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:58.656 align:middle line:84%
that you have right now are
specifically geared towards

00:45:58.656 --> 00:46:03.661 align:middle line:84%
helping you achieve everything
you've achieved right now.

00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to break
free to two or three or four

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.770 align:middle line:84%
or five times more income or
a different, you know, weight,

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:18.076 align:middle line:84%
or a better relationship, you
have to break the habit loop

00:46:18.076 --> 00:46:21.279 align:middle line:84%
that is causing you to think
and behave a certain way.

00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:25.683 align:middle line:84%
And let me share with you
a very simple process.

00:46:25.683 --> 00:46:30.188 align:middle line:84%
Every day, when you wake
up, whatever time it is,

00:46:30.188 --> 00:46:34.692 align:middle line:84%
certain things are triggered
and you have the same triggers

00:46:34.692 --> 00:46:39.430 align:middle line:84%
that cause the same routines
that give you the same rewards.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:43.334 align:middle line:84%
So you have a trigger,
a routine, and a reward.

00:46:43.334 --> 00:46:45.136 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is a trigger?

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:48.439 align:middle line:90%
A trigger can be waking up.

00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:50.575 align:middle line:84%
A trigger can be
the phone ringing.

00:46:50.575 --> 00:46:54.913 align:middle line:84%
A trigger can be you
wanting, you know, coffee.

00:46:54.913 --> 00:46:56.247 align:middle line:90%
Okay? Because you used --

00:46:56.247 --> 00:46:59.183 align:middle line:84%
you're used to getting
coffee every single morning.

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:04.122 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you can learn that
all habits are, are triggers,

00:47:04.122 --> 00:47:06.858 align:middle line:84%
routines, and rewards,
neurologically,

00:47:06.858 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
something triggers you
thinking a certain way.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.629 align:middle line:84%
Something triggers you
behaving a certain way

00:47:11.629 --> 00:47:16.634 align:middle line:84%
and that behavior gives you a
reward, when you understand how

00:47:16.634 --> 00:47:21.139 align:middle line:84%
to identify your triggers
and you understand how

00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:25.009 align:middle line:84%
to change your routine, all of
the latest research suggests

00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:28.079 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have to change
the trigger or the reward.

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:30.949 align:middle line:84%
But if you can change
the routine,

00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:34.252 align:middle line:84%
then you can keep the --
the ends of the trigger

00:47:34.252 --> 00:47:36.054 align:middle line:90%
and the reward the same.

00:47:36.054 --> 00:47:37.989 align:middle line:90%
So what does that look like?

00:47:37.989 --> 00:47:41.459 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you wake
up in the morning

00:47:41.459 --> 00:47:44.796 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing you do is
you look at your cell phone

00:47:44.796 --> 00:47:48.333 align:middle line:84%
to see what emails
you've got coming in.

00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:49.634 align:middle line:90%
So why would you do that?

00:47:49.634 --> 00:47:51.235 align:middle line:90%
Well, you've done that or you do

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:54.105 align:middle line:84%
that because you're
habituated into doing it.

00:47:54.105 --> 00:47:56.741 align:middle line:84%
So there is a trigger,
a routine, and a reward.

00:47:56.741 --> 00:47:58.176 align:middle line:90%
So every time you look at it

00:47:58.176 --> 00:48:01.846 align:middle line:84%
and you communicate whether it's
text or whether it's responding

00:48:01.846 --> 00:48:06.217 align:middle line:84%
to an email or checking the news
or sports score that you like,

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.619 align:middle line:90%
something triggers it.

00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:10.722 align:middle line:84%
You pay attention, you do the
routine, and you get the reward

00:48:10.722 --> 00:48:15.059 align:middle line:84%
of getting that satisfaction,
the satiation point.

00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:18.396 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things that
we know you have to do in order

00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:21.833 align:middle line:84%
to earn two, or three, or four,
or five times more income,

00:48:21.833 --> 00:48:26.170 align:middle line:84%
is you have to break the
habit of being yourself,

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:30.041 align:middle line:84%
all of your habits, you
have garnered and gained

00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:33.644 align:middle line:84%
over the last 10,
20, 30, 40, 50 years.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:36.881 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to
achieve a different result,

00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:41.085 align:middle line:84%
you have to break the habits
that have got you thinking

00:48:41.085 --> 00:48:45.223 align:middle line:84%
and behaving the same
way every single day,

00:48:45.223 --> 00:48:47.725 align:middle line:84%
every single week,
every single month.

00:48:47.725 --> 00:48:52.196 align:middle line:84%
If you set goals and you create
the strategies, the tactics,

00:48:52.196 --> 00:48:56.501 align:middle line:84%
and the processes, these
are all left-brain --

00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:59.437 align:middle line:84%
we call deductive
reasoning abilities

00:48:59.437 --> 00:49:01.839 align:middle line:90%
or imaginative abilities.

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:08.579 align:middle line:84%
But the habits are what drive
the behavior every single day.

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:13.384 align:middle line:84%
And so we talk about achieving
goals, this part of the equation

00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:17.922 align:middle line:84%
up here is the setting of the
goals and setting of the plan.

00:49:17.922 --> 00:49:22.593 align:middle line:84%
Most people stop right
over here or they think

00:49:22.593 --> 00:49:25.563 align:middle line:84%
that if they set their
goals, that habits are going

00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:27.498 align:middle line:90%
to automatically follow.

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:31.102 align:middle line:84%
They don't for longer than a
day or two, or three, or four,

00:49:31.102 --> 00:49:35.940 align:middle line:84%
because all of the decisions
and the behavior for a day,

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.610 align:middle line:84%
or an hour, or a week,
is based on will power.

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:41.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay. So that's great,

00:49:41.746 --> 00:49:43.381 align:middle line:84%
setting strategies
is a great idea.

00:49:43.381 --> 00:49:45.817 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when you
set these new strategies

00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:48.019 align:middle line:90%
up and they don't work?

00:49:48.019 --> 00:49:50.955 align:middle line:84%
What if you have a great new
plan to do something and you go

00:49:50.955 --> 00:49:55.526 align:middle line:84%
after this new venture and it's
a moneymaker, and then it fails?

00:49:55.526 --> 00:49:57.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you think
about Edison

00:49:57.962 --> 00:50:02.066 align:middle line:84%
in inventing the light bulb,
when somebody asked him,

00:50:02.066 --> 00:50:04.836 align:middle line:84%
you know, "How did you deal
with so many failures?"

00:50:04.836 --> 00:50:09.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I didn't fail,
you know, 1799 times.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:14.879 align:middle line:84%
I discovered 1799 ways
that it didn't work."

00:50:14.879 --> 00:50:16.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Which led into the
one way that it did.

00:50:16.247 --> 00:50:18.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Which led him to the
one way that it works.

00:50:18.516 --> 00:50:21.919 align:middle line:84%
The meaning that we give
anything determines how we feel

00:50:21.919 --> 00:50:25.156 align:middle line:84%
about it so there's a real
big difference between,

00:50:25.156 --> 00:50:30.128 align:middle line:84%
"I'm a failure," and
something that I tried

00:50:30.128 --> 00:50:33.364 align:middle line:90%
or something that I did failed.

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:37.768 align:middle line:84%
If success was easy,
nobody would fail

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:41.072 align:middle line:84%
but what happens is that, you
know, we try different things.

00:50:41.072 --> 00:50:42.840 align:middle line:90%
We have our imagination.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.276 align:middle line:84%
We have different skills
and different tools

00:50:45.276 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to try different
combinations, recipes, okay,

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.382 align:middle line:90%
some work, some don't.

00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:54.852 align:middle line:84%
And if you're an
alchemist, okay, and --

00:50:54.852 --> 00:50:57.121 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
different things,

00:50:57.121 --> 00:51:02.126 align:middle line:84%
then somethings will work
out great but many will not.

00:51:02.126 --> 00:51:07.532 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the keys
is how resilient are you

00:51:07.532 --> 00:51:10.701 align:middle line:84%
in not taking it
personally, number one,

00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:13.604 align:middle line:84%
but then getting back
up and trying it again.

00:51:13.604 --> 00:51:17.275 align:middle line:84%
The other is how resourceful
are you because a lot

00:51:17.275 --> 00:51:18.576 align:middle line:90%
of people say that, you know,

00:51:18.576 --> 00:51:20.711 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
money, you need money.

00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:21.946 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:51:21.946 --> 00:51:23.648 align:middle line:84%
There are other people
who have money.

00:51:23.648 --> 00:51:25.416 align:middle line:84%
There's other people
who have ideas.

00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:28.085 align:middle line:84%
There are so many different
ways to be resourceful.

00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> You didn't.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.321 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I know.

00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:32.757 align:middle line:84%
I started with, you
know, negative accounts.

00:51:32.757 --> 00:51:33.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:37.762 align:middle line:84%
>> The key around failure
is once we've recognized

00:51:37.762 --> 00:51:41.232 align:middle line:84%
that something that
we've done hasn't worked,

00:51:41.232 --> 00:51:43.868 align:middle line:84%
it's really important
to learn the art

00:51:43.868 --> 00:51:47.038 align:middle line:90%
of not taking it personally.

00:51:47.038 --> 00:51:51.142 align:middle line:84%
You could own the
reality that you did it

00:51:51.142 --> 00:51:54.011 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't
define who you are.

00:51:54.011 --> 00:51:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you reserve judgment?

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.883 align:middle line:84%
I tell this to people all
the time, reserve judgment

00:51:58.883 --> 00:52:03.654 align:middle line:84%
on whether you are a success
or a failure to the last breath

00:52:03.654 --> 00:52:08.125 align:middle line:84%
of your life because in
the middle of the journey,

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:11.495 align:middle line:84%
there's again highs, lows, ups,
and downs, things that work,

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:15.366 align:middle line:84%
things that don't,
and when we fail

00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:18.703 align:middle line:90%
at something, we're learning.

00:52:18.703 --> 00:52:21.005 align:middle line:84%
And we can either learn
on our own or learn

00:52:21.005 --> 00:52:22.907 align:middle line:90%
from the experiences of others.

00:52:22.907 --> 00:52:27.678 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you have had, I think
five multi-million dollar

00:52:27.678 --> 00:52:31.349 align:middle line:84%
companies where you've created,
you started, and completed,

00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:35.152 align:middle line:84%
and started and you have
several of them still.

00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:39.357 align:middle line:84%
What do you attribute
to your success?

00:52:39.357 --> 00:52:43.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as you say that,
I want people to also know

00:52:43.027 --> 00:52:46.530 align:middle line:84%
that in the five or six
multi-million dollar companies

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.066 align:middle line:84%
that I've built, I've
had a couple of failures

00:52:49.066 --> 00:52:50.735 align:middle line:84%
that would make most
people cry...

00:52:50.735 --> 00:52:51.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:51.602 --> 00:52:53.037 align:middle line:84%
>> ...where I've
let people down.

00:52:53.037 --> 00:52:58.075 align:middle line:84%
I've lost millions of dollars,
hurt my self-esteem, hurt my --

00:52:58.075 --> 00:53:03.381 align:middle line:84%
my beliefs about myself,
hurt me personally

00:53:03.381 --> 00:53:05.483 align:middle line:90%
for a short period of time.

00:53:05.483 --> 00:53:10.588 align:middle line:84%
So in the midst of the losses
and the failures and the errors

00:53:10.588 --> 00:53:13.758 align:middle line:84%
in judgment, what
I've discovered is

00:53:13.758 --> 00:53:21.198 align:middle line:84%
that there are recipes that are
mind-set recipes, ways to look

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:24.568 align:middle line:84%
at things, beliefs
that you can have,

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:29.173 align:middle line:84%
perceptions of seeing the world
and things that don't work,

00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:33.010 align:middle line:84%
perceptions and ways
to behave with people

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:37.682 align:middle line:84%
that really work all the time
and habits, success habits

00:53:37.682 --> 00:53:42.553 align:middle line:84%
that when you repeat those on
an on-going basis, your chances

00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:46.524 align:middle line:84%
for success increase
exponentially.

00:53:46.524 --> 00:53:51.629 align:middle line:84%
In conjunction with the
inside stuff, the inner gain,

00:53:51.629 --> 00:53:55.833 align:middle line:84%
there are things whether it's
in the real estate market,

00:53:55.833 --> 00:54:01.005 align:middle line:84%
the stock market, the business
market, the collectible market,

00:54:01.005 --> 00:54:05.710 align:middle line:84%
any of the businesses, the
finance businesses that we have,

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:09.013 align:middle line:84%
there are fundamentals that when
you stick with the fundamentals

00:54:09.013 --> 00:54:13.684 align:middle line:84%
and then you layer on top of
that, more advanced strategies,

00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:18.322 align:middle line:84%
over a long enough period
of time, you will win.

00:54:18.322 --> 00:54:20.157 align:middle line:90%
What, unfortunately, happens

00:54:20.157 --> 00:54:25.463 align:middle line:84%
for most people is they don't
have enough experience or wisdom

00:54:25.463 --> 00:54:28.065 align:middle line:84%
to know that it's
just a matter of time.

00:54:28.065 --> 00:54:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh [chuckles].

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.202 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I'll give you
an example is, you know,

00:54:31.202 --> 00:54:35.172 align:middle line:84%
we're just coming out of one
of the worst economic times

00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:39.744 align:middle line:84%
that most people in our age
group have ever encountered.

00:54:39.744 --> 00:54:40.845 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:54:40.845 --> 00:54:42.313 align:middle line:84%
>> So we had the
Depression of '29, you know,

00:54:42.313 --> 00:54:45.483 align:middle line:84%
we had several major
depressions.

00:54:45.483 --> 00:54:46.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:46.851 --> 00:54:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we had, you know,
19 -- I'm sorry, 2008, 2009,

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.421 align:middle line:90%
where things just went...

00:54:50.421 --> 00:54:51.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:51.422 --> 00:54:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ... to all hell
in a hand basket.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:56.027 align:middle line:84%
Well, how is it that some
people with experience

00:54:56.027 --> 00:55:00.297 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge became
more wealthy in...

00:55:00.297 --> 00:55:01.065 align:middle line:90%
>> During those times.

00:55:01.065 --> 00:55:02.366 align:middle line:90%
>> ...during those times?

00:55:02.366 --> 00:55:05.803 align:middle line:84%
Well, they had the knowledge
and experience of history

00:55:05.803 --> 00:55:08.806 align:middle line:90%
and recognizing patterns.

00:55:08.806 --> 00:55:12.977 align:middle line:84%
Success, if you've been
around the game long enough,

00:55:12.977 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:84%
leaves clues and
leaves patterns.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:19.650 align:middle line:90%
The wise people follow patterns.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:24.955 align:middle line:84%
The inexperienced mind and
brain sees the pattern,

00:55:24.955 --> 00:55:31.061 align:middle line:84%
becomes fearful, and then reacts
versus responds based on wisdom

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:32.363 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge in history.

00:55:32.363 --> 00:55:33.998 align:middle line:84%
>> So you take it
all into account.

00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:37.067 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a judgment on
whether it's successful or not.

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:41.405 align:middle line:84%
You just move forward and you
use the wisdom that you gained

00:55:41.405 --> 00:55:42.973 align:middle line:90%
to create something really...

00:55:42.973 --> 00:55:47.578 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just for a walk on
the beach a couple of days ago

00:55:47.578 --> 00:55:51.215 align:middle line:84%
with a gentleman that lives
in Los Angeles that used

00:55:51.215 --> 00:55:54.218 align:middle line:90%
to manage billions of dollars.

00:55:54.218 --> 00:55:57.021 align:middle line:84%
And he's made hundreds
of millions

00:55:57.021 --> 00:55:59.523 align:middle line:84%
of dollars himself,
managed billions.

00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And some years, you
know, his fund --

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.496 align:middle line:84%
his hedge fund was
making 30, 40, 50, 60,

00:56:05.496 --> 00:56:08.499 align:middle line:90%
70% on billions of dollars.

00:56:08.499 --> 00:56:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.471 align:middle line:84%
>> One year just several years
ago, probably like 2009, '10,

00:56:13.471 --> 00:56:20.077 align:middle line:84%
he lost 75% of the whole fund
in three months, three months.

00:56:20.077 --> 00:56:20.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:56:20.911 --> 00:56:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And then he got out and then

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.349 align:middle line:84%
when the market started
getting better,

00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:26.884 align:middle line:90%
started reinvesting again

00:56:26.884 --> 00:56:30.421 align:middle line:84%
and he's almost back
to where he was.

00:56:30.421 --> 00:56:31.121 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my goodness.

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, what changed?

00:56:32.523 --> 00:56:37.528 align:middle line:84%
Well, wisdom told him when to
get out and wisdom gave him...

00:56:37.528 --> 00:56:38.662 align:middle line:90%
>> When to get back in.

00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:40.798 align:middle line:84%
>> ...the idea of when
to get back in and then

00:56:40.798 --> 00:56:42.633 align:middle line:90%
because he had experience,

00:56:42.633 --> 00:56:45.603 align:middle line:84%
he was able to recover
and recapture.

00:56:45.603 --> 00:56:48.639 align:middle line:84%
Well, he didn't just
run scared...

00:56:48.639 --> 00:56:50.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Or crumble because
of that [inaudible].

00:56:50.307 --> 00:56:51.375 align:middle line:90%
>> ...or crumble.

00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:54.712 align:middle line:84%
He just took it as a
short period of time

00:56:54.712 --> 00:56:56.680 align:middle line:90%
and what do we know about life?

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.883 align:middle line:84%
There's highs, there's
lows, there's good times,

00:56:58.883 --> 00:56:59.984 align:middle line:90%
there's challenging times,

00:56:59.984 --> 00:57:01.919 align:middle line:84%
there's good markets,
there's bad markets.

00:57:01.919 --> 00:57:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.556 align:middle line:84%
>> And when we learn how
to watch the rhythm of life

00:57:05.556 --> 00:57:07.291 align:middle line:90%
and not react to it...

00:57:07.291 --> 00:57:08.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:11.395 align:middle line:84%
>> ...during the tough
times, and we learn how

00:57:11.395 --> 00:57:15.299 align:middle line:84%
to manage the good times,
now we can have less

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:16.534 align:middle line:90%
of the highs and the lows...

00:57:16.534 --> 00:57:17.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:17.468 --> 00:57:18.302 align:middle line:84%
>> ...and more of
the equilibrium.

00:57:18.302 --> 00:57:20.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes. I remember once hearing

00:57:20.137 --> 00:57:23.541 align:middle line:84%
that you cannot run your
business with emotion.

00:57:23.541 --> 00:57:27.578 align:middle line:84%
The highs, the lows, the drama
should not affect your business

00:57:27.578 --> 00:57:28.879 align:middle line:90%
and your life.

00:57:28.879 --> 00:57:30.447 align:middle line:84%
It's actually good advice
for life as well [chuckles].

00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:32.016 align:middle line:84%
>> It's good advice
for life as well.

00:57:32.016 --> 00:57:33.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:57:33.117 --> 00:57:34.718 align:middle line:90%
You're just gems of wisdom.

00:57:34.718 --> 00:57:38.889 align:middle line:84%
I love looking at success from
a neuro scientific perspective

00:57:38.889 --> 00:57:41.592 align:middle line:84%
because it really shows us
the habits and the patterns

00:57:41.592 --> 00:57:44.528 align:middle line:84%
that we -- that we fall prey
to and that we also can be

00:57:44.528 --> 00:57:46.664 align:middle line:84%
in charge of in order
to be the captain

00:57:46.664 --> 00:57:48.699 align:middle line:90%
of our success ship [laughter].

00:57:48.699 --> 00:57:49.934 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:57:49.934 --> 00:57:50.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:50.868 --> 00:57:52.436 align:middle line:84%
>> And -- and the
key really is --

00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:55.673 align:middle line:84%
is if you just think of four
Rs, we've talked about a couple

00:57:55.673 --> 00:57:58.309 align:middle line:84%
of them is Recognize
what triggers you,

00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:59.944 align:middle line:90%
positive or negative.

00:57:59.944 --> 00:58:03.747 align:middle line:84%
Refrain the negative
things into positive.

00:58:03.747 --> 00:58:07.651 align:middle line:84%
Release whatever you need
to release, forgive quickly,

00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:09.320 align:middle line:90%
you know, yourself and others

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.956 align:middle line:84%
and release the things
that don't serve you.

00:58:11.956 --> 00:58:14.258 align:middle line:84%
And then learn how
to Retrain your brain

00:58:14.258 --> 00:58:16.627 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a
more positive outlook

00:58:16.627 --> 00:58:17.995 align:middle line:84%
and that you're doing
the right things

00:58:17.995 --> 00:58:19.997 align:middle line:84%
in the right order
at the right time.

00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:21.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I am really happy that
you're here [background noise].

00:58:21.665 --> 00:58:23.467 align:middle line:90%
Here's another R [laughter].

00:58:23.467 --> 00:58:25.202 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm really happy to be here.

00:58:25.202 --> 00:58:27.871 align:middle line:84%
>> [Laughter] Thank you
so much, John Assaraf.

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:30.507 align:middle line:84%
What a -- what a pleasure
and so much wisdom

00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:31.675 align:middle line:84%
that you've brought
to the show today.

00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:32.376 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:32.376 --> 00:58:33.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:58:33.744 --> 00:58:35.112 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you would like to
