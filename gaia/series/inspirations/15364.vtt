00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.984 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.652 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:20.754 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to you live
from the Gaiam Studios

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.389 align:middle line:90%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.857 align:middle line:10%
It's great to be with you.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.659 align:middle line:10%
And since this is a
live show, I encourage

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.294 align:middle line:10%
you to communicate
and interact with us

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:28.996 align:middle line:10%
via Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:30.664 align:middle line:10%
Many of you are
already participating,

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.165 align:middle line:10%
so keep those
comments and questions

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.001 align:middle line:10%
coming throughout the show.

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:35.369 align:middle line:10%
So let me ask you a question.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.004 align:middle line:84%
How would you live
your life differently

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.741 align:middle line:84%
if you absolutely knew that
the choices that you make

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:44.645 align:middle line:84%
in the next four years
determines the quality of life

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:48.148 align:middle line:84%
on this planet for
the next 1,000 years?

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.917 align:middle line:90%
Joining me today is Lynne Twist.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.785 align:middle line:84%
She's the author of
"The Soul Of Money,"

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.454 align:middle line:84%
an incredible global
activist and co-founder

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:55.923 align:middle line:90%
of the Pachamama Alliance.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:56.423 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.524 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.091 align:middle line:90%
>>LYNNE TWIST: Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:58.926 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Delighted to be here.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.361 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's an honor
for us to have you.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.329 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.198 align:middle line:84%
So what's the difference
between people

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:08.568 align:middle line:84%
that make a difference
in this world and people

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.405 align:middle line:84%
that talk about making a
difference in this world?

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.906 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Oh, well,
that's a big leap

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.175 align:middle line:84%
from thinking about doing
something to doing something.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.211 align:middle line:10%
So that's really where
a little bit of courage,

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.914 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of fearlessness,
a little bit of going for it

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:25.986 align:middle line:10%
and actually recognizing
that we're living at a time

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.888 align:middle line:10%
where we really need you.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.958 align:middle line:10%
We need each and every person
to step up and make a difference

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:31.625 align:middle line:10%
with their life.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:32.693 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: But what's
it start with?

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:33.961 align:middle line:90%
Does it start with a decision?

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.096 align:middle line:84%
Does it start with
an inspiration?

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:90%
How does it begin?

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.199 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, hopefully
it starts with your show.

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.667 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK, with the show.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:41.501 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.503 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: But I think it
starts with inspiration.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.505 align:middle line:84%
I think it starts with
observing other people.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.108 align:middle line:84%
I think it starts with
seeing a place where

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:50.277 align:middle line:90%
there's an opening for you.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:53.914 align:middle line:84%
I think it takes a little
listening to who you are

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.983 align:middle line:84%
and what your life is about
and actually listening

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:58.485 align:middle line:84%
to your heart rather than your
mind that might tell you, oh,

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.787 align:middle line:84%
you can't matter, you
can't make a difference,

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
don't worry about that,
that's somebody else's job.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.158 align:middle line:84%
And it takes
getting out of being

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:84%
any kind of a victim
about life, but really

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
being in charge of who you
are, what you're here to do,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.301 align:middle line:84%
and how incredible it is to be
alive at this time in history.

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.771 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was that pinnacle
moment for you in your life?

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Or has it always been
this way for you?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.944 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Oh gosh,
there's so many of those.

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:26.513 align:middle line:84%
It resources itself
all the time for me.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.582 align:middle line:84%
Like just sitting here
with you and talking to you

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:31.018 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that people are
out there thinking about what

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.686 align:middle line:90%
they can do, that resources me.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:33.186 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: But I think I
just was in the right place

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.658 align:middle line:84%
at the right time,
you could say,

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
when The Hunger
Project was born.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.432 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually a student
of Buckminster Fuller,

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:48.502 align:middle line:84%
the great teacher, the great
humanist, the great designer,

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:49.336 align:middle line:90%
engineer, architect.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.837 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you had
a major mentor.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.406 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:53.473 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And I also had taken the
EST training way back there.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.711 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:00.914 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And so Werner Erhard
was a really powerful voice

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:05.185 align:middle line:90%
in the world in the early '70s.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.422 align:middle line:84%
And Buckminster Fuller, I
was a student of him, of his.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:11.491 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that if Buckminster
Fuller and Werner Erhard

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:15.062 align:middle line:84%
met each other, that
there would be a miracle.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:18.098 align:middle line:84%
And so I, along with a couple
of friends of mine, Ron Landsman

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:20.333 align:middle line:84%
being one of them, we
made sure they met.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.836 align:middle line:84%
And when they did, The
Hunger Project was born.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:25.472 align:middle line:84%
And I was like in the right
place at the right time when,

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.407 align:middle line:90%
I think, a miracle occurred.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:90%
And I could not not participate.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.046 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
that sometimes there's

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.849 align:middle line:84%
a call that comes
to you or you start

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.251 align:middle line:84%
to realize that you're
moving towards something

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.986 align:middle line:90%
and there's an opening for you.

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.756 align:middle line:84%
But if you really listen
to and pay attention,

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.724 align:middle line:84%
the universe is calling
for all of us now.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:45.492 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All the time, right?

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.326 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: All the time.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.094 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All the time.

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.296 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: If you're really
willing to be open to it,

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:50.564 align:middle line:90%
you just can't miss it.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.265 align:middle line:84%
If you're closed to
it, you'll miss it.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.733 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:54.835 align:middle line:90%
It's there for everybody.

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well that, I
mean, obviously you

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.904 align:middle line:84%
were in the right place
at the right time.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.172 align:middle line:90%
But it was much more than that.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:01.508 align:middle line:84%
You had the vision initially
and you followed through

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:03.877 align:middle line:84%
with connecting those
two major visionaries.

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And look, they birthed
another visionary. [LAUGHS]

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.647 align:middle line:90%
Out of the whole thing.

00:04:07.647 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
There's some great questions
coming in on Facebook.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.518 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
saying, "Is it better

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:14.087 align:middle line:84%
to give of one's
time or one's money

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.655 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
making a difference?"

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.925 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Well I say do both.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:23.597 align:middle line:84%
I'm a global activist, so action
is really important to me.

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.532 align:middle line:84%
I'm also a fundraiser
and a philanthropist.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:28.235 align:middle line:84%
So how we use our money
is really important to me.

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:31.238 align:middle line:84%
And the word philanthropy,
just for everybody to know,

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:90%
it means love of humankind.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.641 align:middle line:90%
That's what that word means.

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:35.876 align:middle line:90%
Philanthropy.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:37.644 align:middle line:90%
So everybody is one.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And we get the
opportunity to express

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.649 align:middle line:90%
this in every way every day.

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:46.553 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great actions
you can take is giving money.

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:50.724 align:middle line:84%
So giving $50 or $1 or
$500, that's an action.

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:53.093 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As long as you know
that it's to the right place.

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:55.829 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: If you feel that
it's resonant with you

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.065 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that's
meaningful for you, making

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.601 align:middle line:84%
a difference with your money is
a very, very powerful action.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.136 align:middle line:90%
It's not a non action.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.906 align:middle line:84%
Then at the same time, you
want to give your whole self

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:07.274 align:middle line:90%
to something you believe in.

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:11.244 align:middle line:84%
So getting involved,
volunteering, understanding it,

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.413 align:middle line:84%
studying it, and sharing
it with other people.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.182 align:middle line:90%
So I say do everything.

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:16.216 align:middle line:90%
That's my motto.

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:16.816 align:middle line:90%
Do everything.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.285 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So Susanna
from Facebook is

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:20.153 align:middle line:84%
saying, "Do small
donations to nonprofits

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:20.954 align:middle line:90%
really make a difference?"

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:21.555 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:22.589 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And so they do.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.291 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: If you just
think about this,

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.093 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi's campaign in
India was funded, yes,

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:84%
by wealthy
industrialists, but also

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.033 align:middle line:84%
by literally
hundreds of thousands

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:35.468 align:middle line:84%
of people who gave
one rupee, two rupee.

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
the Obama campaign,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.240 align:middle line:84%
whether you are an
Obama fan or not,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.643 align:middle line:84%
that was the most robust
political financial campaign

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:44.377 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.379 align:middle line:84%
And the average donation
was something like $39.

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.281 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All done through
Facebook and Twitter,

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:48.815 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:49.416 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:51.117 align:middle line:84%
So small donations,
particularly now,

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:54.921 align:middle line:84%
when civil society is really
what's making everything

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:58.592 align:middle line:84%
happen, civil society being
the population, people,

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:01.828 align:middle line:84%
just general folks, that's
actually where the action is.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.797 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in
the Occupy Movement.

00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:06.366 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in almost
everything you look at.

Arab Spring.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.469 align:middle line:84%
It's really people
standing up for what

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.439 align:middle line:84%
they believe in that's turning
the world on its ear right now.

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:14.207 align:middle line:90%
So yes, yes, yes.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.509 align:middle line:84%
Small donations make a
really big difference.

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:17.577 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You heard it here.

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:27.721 align:middle line:84%
and who you are in your life led
you to the Amazon, didn't it?

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.923 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: It did.

00:06:29.923 --> 00:06:33.093 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful
and blessed to work

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:35.795 align:middle line:84%
with indigenous peoples of the
Amazon, the Achuar, the Shuar,

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
the Shiwiar, the Cofan, the
Koji, the Kayapo, the U'wa,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.803 align:middle line:84%
the Zaparo people, the
Kichwas, many, many more.

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:46.506 align:middle line:84%
People who are living in
their traditional ways.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:48.375 align:middle line:84%
People who are not
caught in this consumer

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:90%
trance that we're caught in.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.445 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
fiercely defending

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.981 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
ecosystems on Earth, the Amazon

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:55.649 align:middle line:90%
rainforest.

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:59.386 align:middle line:84%
And so with the Pachamama
Alliance we are their allies,

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:00.387 align:middle line:90%
we are their partners.

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:03.523 align:middle line:10%
It is an alliance between
indigenous people of the Amazon

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.358 align:middle line:10%
and the Andes and
conscious committed people

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:06.559 align:middle line:10%
in the modern world like you.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.728 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, I want to
actually show a clip of that

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:10%
and you can get a little bit of
an idea of what the Pachamama

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.564 align:middle line:10%
Alliance is.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.166 align:middle line:84%
And I want to find
out how you got

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.036 align:middle line:84%
that call to go
to the rainforest.

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:19.372 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that clip.

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:22.776 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:26.413 align:middle line:84%
-This is where the
Pachamama Alliance began.

00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:28.648 align:middle line:84%
With the Achuar
people of Ecuador,

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.151 align:middle line:84%
an ancient dream culture
still living in harmony

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
with their ancestral land,
nearly two million acres

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:90%
of pristine tropical rainforest.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.627 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1980s, the
Achuar elders and shamans

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:43.563 align:middle line:84%
began having dreams and
visions that a grave threat

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:46.566 align:middle line:90%
was coming to their people.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:48.601 align:middle line:10%
The Achuar soon realized
what that threat

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:52.672 align:middle line:10%
was as they began to see what
contact with the outside world

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:55.408 align:middle line:10%
and its thirst for oil
was doing to the land

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:59.145 align:middle line:10%
and cultures of their
indigenous neighbors.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:02.615 align:middle line:84%
And so the Achuar
made a bold move.

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.718 align:middle line:84%
They reached out to
create a partnership

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:08.488 align:middle line:84%
with the very world that was
threatening to destroy them.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.758 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, a call issued
forth from the heart

00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:14.561 align:middle line:84%
of the natural world that
was heard thousands of miles

00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:18.298 align:middle line:84%
away by a small group of
people in the modern world.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:20.967 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of that
year, in a remote village

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
in the rainforest, these
two worlds came together

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.373 align:middle line:84%
and the Pachamama
alliance was born.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:84%
Since that time, this
partnership has flourished.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.648 align:middle line:10%
With financial and
organizational support

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:38.284 align:middle line:10%
from the Pachamama Alliance
and its foundation in Ecuador,

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.486 align:middle line:10%
the Achuar have
gained skills that

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:43.123 align:middle line:10%
enable them to protect
their land and culture

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:45.425 align:middle line:10%
as well as assert their
legal and collective rights

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:47.761 align:middle line:10%
at the national and
international levels.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.532 align:middle line:84%
They've established their
own aviation company

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.602 align:middle line:84%
to service the Achuar owned
and operated Kapawi ecolodge.

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Through the Jungle
Mamas program,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.376 align:middle line:84%
Achuar women and men are
addressing birthing practices,

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:07.614 align:middle line:84%
family planning, and the
health of their communities.

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The Pachamama Alliance now
works with all the Achuar's

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
indigenous neighbors
in Ecuador, as well as

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.755 align:middle line:84%
with indigenous groups
in the neighboring border

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:19.325 align:middle line:84%
countries of Colombia,
Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil,

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.127 align:middle line:84%
helping to protect
tens of millions

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
of acres of pristine
tropical rainforest.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.165 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:26.499 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what led you there?

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:30.737 align:middle line:84%
What was the invitation that
got you to this incredible area

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.138 align:middle line:90%
and with these people?

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.741 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I had a
really profound experience

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.344 align:middle line:84%
with a shaman in Guatemala with
my friend John Perkins, who

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.481 align:middle line:84%
had spent a lot of time with
the Shuar people in the Amazon

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:43.716 align:middle line:84%
when he was in the Peace
Corps many years ago.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.852 align:middle line:84%
And knew that the
Achuar people, who

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:50.423 align:middle line:84%
were referenced in that video,
had been isolated by design

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:84%
but had received these
messages from their spirit gods

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.363 align:middle line:84%
in their dreams and visions
that contact was inevitable.

00:09:57.363 --> 00:10:00.467 align:middle line:84%
So they initiated the contact
through dreams and visions,

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:01.701 align:middle line:90%
which is how they communicate.

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.036 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of their telephone.

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:06.339 align:middle line:84%
And so John and I-- And
John understood that.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:06.906 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.575 align:middle line:84%
I was working on
hunger and poverty,

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.577 align:middle line:84%
so I was completely
clueless about what kind

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:14.581 align:middle line:84%
of weird visions I was having,
which were quite weird but very

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.249 align:middle line:90%
profound and very moving.

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:19.986 align:middle line:84%
But John really let me
know and made it clear

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:22.622 align:middle line:84%
that we were being called
to go to the Amazon

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.057 align:middle line:84%
and meet with the
Achuar and have

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:25.925 align:middle line:84%
a very primary first
encounter with them.

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:28.261 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you were having
those visions and experiences

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.029 align:middle line:84%
before you ever
went to the Amazon?

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:33.633 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: I was and I tried
not to have them and tired

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
to deny them because they were
very disturbing and erupting.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.205 align:middle line:84%
But eventually it
became clear that this

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.274 align:middle line:84%
was something we
needed to respond to.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:45.245 align:middle line:84%
So John and I and my husband
Bill and nine other people,

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
we went down to this
part of the Amazon,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.117 align:middle line:84%
down into a very, very deep
and remote part of the Amazon

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:52.085 align:middle line:90%
where there's no roads.

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:55.421 align:middle line:84%
We flew in a small plane
and had our first encounter

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:56.623 align:middle line:90%
with the Achuar leaders.

00:10:56.623 --> 00:11:00.159 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
experience over which

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.961 align:middle line:84%
I have never gotten
and never will

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:03.296 align:middle line:90%
and I hope never to get over it.

00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:06.866 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it birthed an
amazing journey, a movement.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.101 align:middle line:90%
It birthed an entire moment.

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:10.136 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: It birthed the
Pachamama Alliance, which

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:13.806 align:middle line:84%
is this alliance between
those indigenous people

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:84%
plus all the indigenous
peoples of the Amazon now

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.579 align:middle line:84%
and the conscious committed
people in the modern world who

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:23.016 align:middle line:84%
really realize that the
actual sustainability of life

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:23.917 align:middle line:90%
is under threat.

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:25.618 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the people
of the rainforest

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:28.555 align:middle line:84%
live in community
with the rainforest.

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:84%
They treat their plants
and everything around them

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:36.896 align:middle line:84%
like it is a mother,
a being, an animal.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:38.998 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about what you learned.

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:40.833 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, there's
a way of living

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:44.404 align:middle line:84%
that we're very
removed from now.

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:48.341 align:middle line:84%
We've become very isolated as a
species from all other species.

00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:51.377 align:middle line:84%
And we use other
species, we almost

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:84%
exploit other species, plants
and animals, for our own gain.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Whether that's
right or wrong, I'm

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.851 align:middle line:84%
not making too much of
a judgment about it,

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:01.487 align:middle line:84%
but indigenous people, they
just don't live that way.

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:04.857 align:middle line:84%
And they see that we are
living in a kind of a trance

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:08.928 align:middle line:84%
where we've kind of lost our way
and really don't actually see

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:11.364 align:middle line:84%
our place in the
universe the way they do.

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:13.166 align:middle line:84%
They don't make us
wrong for it, but they

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:16.536 align:middle line:84%
live in total communion
with the natural world,

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:19.138 align:middle line:84%
with every plant, with
every bug, with every snake,

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
with every animal.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.111 align:middle line:84%
They see a giant
otter, they see a deer,

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.347 align:middle line:84%
or they see a dolphin,
a river dolphin,

00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:29.215 align:middle line:84%
they have beautiful
pink river dolphins

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:31.184 align:middle line:90%
in rivers in the Amazon.

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:34.354 align:middle line:84%
And they consider it their
brother or their sister.

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:38.224 align:middle line:84%
They actually relate to
the forest not as someplace

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:41.227 align:middle line:84%
they live, but that
they're of the forest.

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:45.565 align:middle line:84%
And plants and animals are
their kin, their teachers,

00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:48.901 align:middle line:84%
their brothers and
sisters, and even

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.104 align:middle line:84%
feel they're carrying the
energy of their ancestors.

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:54.073 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tremendous
reverence for life.

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:56.142 align:middle line:84%
And it's humbling when
you're in their presence

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.144 align:middle line:84%
and in the presence
of that reverence.

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:00.647 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so
different in a way.

00:13:00.647 --> 00:13:02.882 align:middle line:84%
There's a teaching plant
there, the ayahuasca plant

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:06.719 align:middle line:84%
I've heard a lot about here
as being a mother, teacher,

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:09.155 align:middle line:90%
a messenger in a sense.

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:10.757 align:middle line:84%
Have you had
experience with that?

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:12.258 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little about that?

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:12.925 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yes.

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:14.994 align:middle line:84%
Really when you work
with indigenous people,

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:19.465 align:middle line:84%
they live in a cosmology, I
could say, an understanding

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:23.436 align:middle line:84%
of the world that has a
huge spiritual component.

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:28.307 align:middle line:84%
And rather than just what we
can see, feel, hear, and touch,

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:31.044 align:middle line:84%
they see a whole
nother set of realms.

00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:33.146 align:middle line:84%
And in order to be effective
in working with them,

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.014 align:middle line:84%
it's important to
connect with that.

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:39.252 align:middle line:84%
And their access to that,
their portal to that, really

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:41.654 align:middle line:84%
the doorway to that
is a teaching plant

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.957 align:middle line:84%
called ayahuasca or for the
Achuar it's called natem.

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:47.427 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a drug.

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:50.863 align:middle line:90%
It's not chemically produced.

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:53.132 align:middle line:90%
It's not a hallucinogenic.

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:55.234 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a plant.

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:56.536 align:middle line:90%
They consider it a teacher.

00:13:56.536 --> 00:14:00.873 align:middle line:84%
They consider it a direct
teacher from mother earth.

00:14:00.873 --> 00:14:02.408 align:middle line:90%
They consider it a woman.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:05.912 align:middle line:84%
And the shamans prepare it
with great sacred reverence.

00:14:05.912 --> 00:14:09.282 align:middle line:84%
It takes days to prepare
an ayahuasca ceremony.

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:12.452 align:middle line:84%
And then it always
is done at dark.

00:14:12.452 --> 00:14:15.121 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman administers
it and he gives you

00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:18.057 align:middle line:84%
a particular potion that
he has made and blown

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:84%
his spirit into that comes from
this plant, which is actually

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.795 align:middle line:90%
a vine.

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:26.265 align:middle line:84%
And it's in a kind of a brown,
very bitter tasting liquid.

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.735 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's not something you
would want to do on your own.

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:30.436 align:middle line:84%
You want to do this
with the assistance

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:35.208 align:middle line:84%
of the cultural ceremonial
process administered

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.676 align:middle line:90%
by the shaman, right?

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:38.811 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: I would say yes.

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:41.914 align:middle line:84%
I know there's people
who do it in other ways.

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:45.017 align:middle line:84%
I would say my experience is
this is where it comes from,

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:48.654 align:middle line:84%
these people have been doing
it for thousands of years.

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:51.724 align:middle line:84%
Their expertise, their
reverence for it,

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.326 align:middle line:90%
it's a sacred ceremony for them.

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:56.996 align:middle line:84%
And also it's not necessarily
a pleasant experience.

00:14:56.996 --> 00:15:00.066 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it'll
ever be too recreational.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:04.504 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a toxicity
to it and it makes you purge.

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:06.773 align:middle line:84%
Not every single person
every single time,

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:10.076 align:middle line:84%
but most people have a kind of
an experience where they purge.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:10.777 align:middle line:90%
They vomit.

00:15:10.777 --> 00:15:12.078 align:middle line:90%
They cleanse.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.346 align:middle line:90%
They consider it purging.

00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:15.915 align:middle line:84%
They consider it a
part of the process,

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.017 align:middle line:84%
purging this way
or the other way.

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:21.287 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the toxicity of
your thoughts and your body?

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:22.221 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: And your body.

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:25.091 align:middle line:84%
And also your doubts
about yourself,

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.993 align:middle line:90%
your anger with your mother.

00:15:26.993 --> 00:15:29.996 align:middle line:90%
It comes out of you physically.

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:32.632 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very important
part of the whole process,

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:33.566 align:middle line:90%
but it's not pleasant.

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:36.269 align:middle line:90%
You feel very, very, very ill.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.906 align:middle line:84%
Then it passes eventually
and then the visions come.

00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:42.975 align:middle line:90%
And the visions are very vivid.

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:90%
They're very unique.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.313 align:middle line:84%
You've never seen the kinds
of things you see before.

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:49.882 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can see
inside of your hand.

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:51.784 align:middle line:84%
You can see inside
of a leaf sometimes.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:52.885 align:middle line:90%
It's very personal.

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.987 align:middle line:90%
It's different for every person.

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:57.957 align:middle line:84%
You see what she
wants to teach you.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.492 align:middle line:90%
I'll put it that way.

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:01.727 align:middle line:84%
You'll often see the
face of the shaman who's

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:03.596 align:middle line:90%
administering the whole process.

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:06.098 align:middle line:84%
He stays with everybody
all night long.

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:08.434 align:middle line:90%
It lasts for many, many hours.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.837 align:middle line:84%
You look in the sky
and the sky becomes

00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:15.274 align:middle line:84%
a panoply of colors and
shapes, geometric shapes.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:19.011 align:middle line:84%
It's a spectacular
experience for most people.

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.583 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what it is.

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:24.851 align:middle line:90%
You can't make sense of it.

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:26.352 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you
remember everything.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: But you
remember everything.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.054 align:middle line:90%
You don't go unconscious.

00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:30.623 align:middle line:84%
You may not be able to walk,
but you don't go unconscious.

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:32.892 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is where
the vision for the Pachamama

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:34.527 align:middle line:90%
Alliance came through?

00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:38.097 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: In a way, it's when we
realized that this was not just

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:41.467 align:middle line:84%
a trip to the Amazon that was
pretty exciting and impressive

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:42.969 align:middle line:84%
and we would tell
everybody about it

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:84%
when we went home,
but rather this was

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.674 align:middle line:84%
a call, a very deep and
profound call, that was not

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.009 align:middle line:90%
part of our plan for ourselves.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:53.346 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about when I say
us, my husband Bill and I.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:55.882 align:middle line:90%
We had our plates totally full.

00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:58.751 align:middle line:84%
We had no extra space to
take anything on, take

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:02.421 align:middle line:84%
on another project or
another cause or anything.

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:05.458 align:middle line:84%
But it became clear to us
although this wasn't our plan

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:08.261 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves, it was
absolutely our destiny.

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And that came to us that
night, you could say,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.367 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't make sense of
that until a few days later.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:18.436 align:middle line:84%
And now when we look back years
later, it's absolutely clear.

00:17:18.436 --> 00:17:21.507 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like the
messages come in technicolor

00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:23.541 align:middle line:90%
and then you understand them.

00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:25.511 align:middle line:84%
You actually need
to integrate it.

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:28.013 align:middle line:84%
And a shaman's very
helpful with that too.

00:17:28.013 --> 00:17:30.216 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But then you came
and made it a reality.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And you taught people how
to respect the forest.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.622 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that, you
created an entire movement

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:37.657 align:middle line:90%
with an alliance.

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:39.659 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is the alliance?

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:41.027 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well,
the word Pachamama

00:17:41.027 --> 00:17:44.797 align:middle line:84%
means the earth, the sky,
the universe and all time

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:47.466 align:middle line:90%
to the Quechua people.

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.201 align:middle line:90%
Shorthand means Mother Earth.

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So the Pachamama
Alliance is an alliance

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.674 align:middle line:84%
between these people that are
living in this way and people

00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:55.775 align:middle line:90%
like us.

00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:58.077 align:middle line:84%
And we've all become
allies with them.

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an
organization, yes,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.349 align:middle line:84%
but it's almost
like an organism.

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:07.586 align:middle line:10%
And we work to preserve the
Earth's tropical rainforest

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.522 align:middle line:10%
by empowering the
indigenous people who

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:10%
are its natural custodians.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.161 align:middle line:10%
And they are the most effective
defender of those forests.

00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:10%
So empowering them is
the core of our work.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.466 align:middle line:84%
And then from the lessons
learned from them,

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.601 align:middle line:84%
of which there are
many and they're

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:26.939 align:middle line:84%
amazing and very profound,
the second part of our mission

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:29.575 align:middle line:84%
is to bring forth
a thriving, just,

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:31.444 align:middle line:84%
and sustainable way
of life on Earth.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:35.114 align:middle line:84%
Or to bring forth an
environmentally sustainable,

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:84%
spiritually fulfilling,
and socially just human

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.452 align:middle line:90%
presence on this planet.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.654 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well there's
a whole campaign

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:44.423 align:middle line:84%
that you've started and
launched as a result of this

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:47.159 align:middle line:84%
that really-- it's very,
very inspiring and motivating

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:48.494 align:middle line:90%
and I want to show a clip of it.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.196 align:middle line:84%
But how did this
campaign get started?

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
It's called Four
Years Go, right?

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.231 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:55.034 align:middle line:84%
Four Years Go really
came from the Awakening

00:18:55.034 --> 00:18:56.869 align:middle line:84%
the Dreamer symposium,
which I think

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:59.105 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about maybe
after Four Years Go, which

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:03.509 align:middle line:84%
is an educational program that
we've created to literally

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:05.945 align:middle line:84%
change the dream
of the modern world

00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
from a dream of
consumption and more

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.783 align:middle line:84%
to a dream that's
environmentally sustainable,

00:19:10.783 --> 00:19:13.519 align:middle line:84%
spiritually fulfilling,
and socially just.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:16.989 align:middle line:84%
And we began to see
that the tide was not

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:20.793 align:middle line:84%
turning fast enough away from
a dangerous future to a future

00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:21.694 align:middle line:90%
that we all want.

00:19:21.694 --> 00:19:25.631 align:middle line:84%
And that that unpleasant,
unsustainable, violent,

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:29.568 align:middle line:84%
inhospitable future was moving
towards us faster than anybody

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
predicted, including
the scientists,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.372 align:middle line:84%
and that we needed
to turn the tide away

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:37.843 align:middle line:84%
from that future faster before
things are irreversible.

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:42.181 align:middle line:84%
And so we named these four
years 2011, last year, 2012,

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:46.018 align:middle line:84%
this year, 2013, 2014,
as the four years

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.988 align:middle line:84%
that can turn the tide
where the choices we make,

00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:52.191 align:middle line:84%
as you said, as a human
community, can really

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.226 align:middle line:84%
and probably will determine
the future of life

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:55.995 align:middle line:84%
on Earth for the
next 1,000 years.

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:59.565 align:middle line:84%
And if we wake up to that,
rather than being afraid,

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:04.036 align:middle line:84%
we get to see the power and
privilege and the leverage

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.572 align:middle line:84%
of being alive at a time
when our lives can make such

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.941 align:middle line:84%
a profound difference
for future generations.

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:12.378 align:middle line:84%
So we created a media
campaign, a shout out

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:13.846 align:middle line:84%
to everybody to
let them know that.

00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:14.847 align:middle line:90%
And it's called Four Years Go.

00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:16.449 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is what we're
going to take a look at.

00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:18.717 align:middle line:84%
And where your Facebook
comments are coming in,

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:21.654 align:middle line:84%
Joel asks, "What's the best
hope for the world right now?"

00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:26.826 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this clip and
you'll see what that means.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.141 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:31.777 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you showed
that to a room of us,

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:33.679 align:middle line:90%
we all stood up and cheered.

00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:36.215 align:middle line:84%
It's so inspiring
and motivating.

00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to get out
there and do something.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:42.154 align:middle line:84%
Show that to your organization,
your school, wherever,

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:45.758 align:middle line:84%
because it really gives you
inspiration and motivation.

00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So why specifically
now that campaign?

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.497 align:middle line:84%
What is the importance
of this time in history?

00:23:51.497 --> 00:23:52.765 align:middle line:90%
What's been prophesized?

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well,
there's a lot of ways

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.169 align:middle line:84%
to answer that question, why
this important time history.

00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:00.439 align:middle line:84%
But the prophecies
themselves are

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:03.108 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that really points to,

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:05.344 align:middle line:84%
especially this
year, actually, 2012.

00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's the Mayan
prophecy, the Mayan calendar

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.014 align:middle line:90%
ends in 2012.

00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And really what that is is
not the end of something,

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.453 align:middle line:84%
it's the rebirth of
the human family.

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.688 align:middle line:90%
The White Buffalo prophecy.

00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:16.055 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's the beginning.

00:24:16.055 --> 00:24:17.756 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: It's the
beginning of something.

00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:19.525 align:middle line:84%
It's a transformational
prophecy.

00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:22.628 align:middle line:84%
There's the Eagle and the
Condor prophecy prophesying

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:25.764 align:middle line:84%
that the eagle people, the
people of the mind, people

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:29.568 align:middle line:84%
in the kind of Western
mindset and the condor

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:31.036 align:middle line:84%
people, the people
who live in kind

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:32.905 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
relationship with the earth,

00:24:32.905 --> 00:24:35.908 align:middle line:84%
the indigenous people, will
come together during this time

00:24:35.908 --> 00:24:38.544 align:middle line:84%
and fly together in the
same sky wing to wing.

00:24:38.544 --> 00:24:40.746 align:middle line:84%
And the whole world will
come back into balance.

00:24:40.746 --> 00:24:43.215 align:middle line:84%
That's the Eagle and
the Condor prophecy.

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:46.151 align:middle line:84%
Been told for millennia in
the Amazon and the Andes

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.519 align:middle line:90%
about right now.

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:50.222 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
White Buffalo prophecy.

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:52.024 align:middle line:90%
And there's the--

00:24:52.024 --> 00:24:52.558 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hopi.

00:24:52.558 --> 00:24:56.261 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Hopi prophecy, exactly,
about this time in history.

00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:58.163 align:middle line:84%
And then there's--
even in the "I Ching,"

00:24:58.163 --> 00:25:02.334 align:middle line:84%
there's a prophecy about 2012
being the time when we move

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:07.272 align:middle line:84%
as a human community from
living in a culture of habit

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:10.776 align:middle line:84%
to a culture that begins
to enter into novelty.

00:25:10.776 --> 00:25:15.781 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that all of
this is you can either buy it

00:25:15.781 --> 00:25:16.515 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:25:16.515 --> 00:25:18.083 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter if you do.

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:21.854 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think about
it, thousands of years ago

00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:25.057 align:middle line:84%
and until now, people have
been waiting for this time.

00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:27.025 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
pay attention to that.

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.026 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's no mistake.

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:28.994 align:middle line:90%
It's not an accident.

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:30.562 align:middle line:90%
This is here for this reason.

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:33.265 align:middle line:84%
Why our consciousness is
raising and this shift

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:35.033 align:middle line:84%
is occurring right
now is intentional.

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:39.037 align:middle line:84%
It's been prophesized way beyond
our time and before our time,

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:39.905 align:middle line:90%
I should say.

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:42.674 align:middle line:84%
And there's planetary alignments
and everywhere that you

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:45.177 align:middle line:84%
look is this direction
of this shift in history.

00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:46.645 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do is
we're going to take a break,

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.046 align:middle line:84%
and when we come
back, we're going

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:51.683 align:middle line:84%
to find out what other journeys
that Lynne has been on that

00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:84%
has guided her on her journey
and how we specifically

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.358 align:middle line:84%
can make a difference in this
wonderful, critical, important

00:25:59.358 --> 00:26:02.394 align:middle line:84%
time in history and why
it's so important right now.

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.862 align:middle line:90%
So we will be right back.

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:06.098 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:09.802 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:15.207 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is Lynne Twist,
global activist, visionary,

00:26:15.207 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
author of "The Soul of Money"
and co-founder of the Pachamama

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.078 align:middle line:84%
Alliance, which we just
talked a little bit about.

00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:21.914 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this is a
live interactive show,

00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:23.348 align:middle line:84%
so I want you to
keep communicating

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:24.716 align:middle line:84%
with us via Facebook
and Twitter.

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:26.318 align:middle line:90%
I love your comments.

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:27.853 align:middle line:84%
I want you to post
on there what you

00:26:27.853 --> 00:26:29.888 align:middle line:84%
think you can do to
make a difference.

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.423 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
this is all about

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.959 align:middle line:84%
is Lynn is an amazing
inspiration for all of us.

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:90%
But what can you do?

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.662 align:middle line:84%
And I want to read
some of those comments

00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:39.164 align:middle line:84%
so that we can also
inspire others.

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:41.567 align:middle line:84%
Lynne is going to take us on
a little journey here of some

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:44.603 align:middle line:84%
of the places that
she has been that she

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:48.941 align:middle line:84%
has brought massive change to
indigenous cultures and people

00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.977 align:middle line:84%
and had communication with
people like Mother Teresa.

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:54.446 align:middle line:84%
We have some slides
here to show you.

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Where's this?

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.416 align:middle line:90%
This is a school that you were--

00:26:57.416 --> 00:27:00.486 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Yes, I worked
for The Hunger Project,

00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:02.955 align:middle line:84%
an organization dedicated to
ending world hunger that still

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:05.991 align:middle line:84%
is robust, beautiful,
global movement for 20

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:06.725 align:middle line:90%
years of my life.

00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:07.759 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Still there, yes.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:10.762 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And managed the
global fundraising operations

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:12.498 align:middle line:90%
in 47, 57 countries.

00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:13.599 align:middle line:90%
I can't even remember.

00:27:13.599 --> 00:27:17.369 align:middle line:84%
And was really privileged to
work in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:20.506 align:middle line:84%
India, Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka, Botswana, Ethiopia.

00:27:20.506 --> 00:27:25.377 align:middle line:84%
And this is an example of
being in Asia in a school

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:28.547 align:middle line:84%
where they had
never educated girls

00:27:28.547 --> 00:27:32.317 align:middle line:84%
and where girls were
considered not educable.

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:33.552 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that's a word.

00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But that girls and women didn't
have the same value as men.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:43.695 align:middle line:84%
And that's a huge, huge
important part of understanding

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:46.031 align:middle line:84%
hunger and poverty
is the suppression

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
or the brutal subjugation
of women and girls.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.069 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually at the
heart of hunger and poverty.

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And the liberation and
ending the brutal subjugation

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.644 align:middle line:84%
of women and girls is the
most powerful intervention

00:27:58.644 --> 00:28:00.646 align:middle line:84%
for eradicating
hunger and poverty.

00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:02.848 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
particular situation,

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:05.717 align:middle line:84%
we were working to bring
girls into that school,

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:08.887 align:middle line:84%
to have girls actually
be taught to read.

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:11.623 align:middle line:84%
Because they say, particularly
in Africa and also in Asia,

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:14.593 align:middle line:84%
if you educate a man or
boy you educate a person.

00:28:14.593 --> 00:28:15.661 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that.

00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:18.564 align:middle line:84%
If you educate a girl or a
woman, you educate a nation.

00:28:18.564 --> 00:28:21.166 align:middle line:90%
Because females just do that.

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:23.335 align:middle line:90%
They share with each other.

00:28:23.335 --> 00:28:25.537 align:middle line:84%
So educating girls was
a really important part

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.339 align:middle line:84%
of our initiative and
that's a school where

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:30.509 align:middle line:84%
were working to bring girls
into the educational system

00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and set up a literacy center.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.446 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A really incredible
way to make a difference.

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:36.281 align:middle line:90%
And this is with Bill Clinton.

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:39.017 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: This is when President
Clinton was president.

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:41.286 align:middle line:84%
We gave-- we being
The Hunger Project--

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
gave an award each year
to a great African leader

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:49.695 align:middle line:84%
to really hold up that there
are great people in Africa doing

00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:53.465 align:middle line:84%
good jobs leading countries
and leading initiatives.

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Because mostly we hear
about the corruption.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So to really have people
see Africa in a new light.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.539 align:middle line:84%
And that year we
gave the Africa prize

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:02.507 align:middle line:84%
for leadership, which is
the name of the award.

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:04.943 align:middle line:84%
And that's Joan Holmes, the
president of The Hunger Project

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:07.946 align:middle line:84%
at the time, and President
Clinton, and myself.

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:09.982 align:middle line:90%
We gave it to Nelson Mandela.

00:29:09.982 --> 00:29:12.551 align:middle line:84%
And so President Clinton
came to honor Mandela

00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:14.653 align:middle line:84%
and to the African
prize ceremony

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:16.254 align:middle line:84%
which was in
Washington that year.

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:17.889 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Talk about
making a difference.

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:19.424 align:middle line:90%
He definitely has done that.

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.959 align:middle line:90%
All right, this is you with--

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:23.795 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: These are
children in Senegal.

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:26.999 align:middle line:84%
I worked a lot many years
ago in the Sahel Desert

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:31.203 align:middle line:84%
where you don't even see a blade
of grass for hundreds of miles.

00:29:31.203 --> 00:29:34.806 align:middle line:84%
And the sand is kind of red and
your lungs are filled with sand

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:36.808 align:middle line:84%
and you're covered
with silt all the time.

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:40.512 align:middle line:84%
The Sahel moves about a
half a kilometer each year

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:44.616 align:middle line:84%
and is covering more
and more of West Africa.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.918 align:middle line:84%
And in this
particular arena, this

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:84%
was a group of children
who welcomed us

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.257 align:middle line:84%
as we came to work with some
women who had an intuition

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:55.327 align:middle line:84%
and had had dreams
that there was water

00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:57.729 align:middle line:84%
under the desert where they
were living where there were

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:01.667 align:middle line:84%
17 villages stringed together
and no water and no food.

00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:03.935 align:middle line:84%
And people were really
starving to death.

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:06.538 align:middle line:84%
And these women had an
intuition that there

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:09.307 align:middle line:84%
was water under the
ground and it was deep.

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.677 align:middle line:84%
And it was a Muslim
community and the mullahs

00:30:11.677 --> 00:30:13.578 align:middle line:90%
would not allow women to dig.

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a man's job.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.481 align:middle line:84%
And the women
couldn't get the men

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.884 align:middle line:84%
to dig because they didn't
believe the water was there.

00:30:18.884 --> 00:30:25.257 align:middle line:84%
And so through some very, very
heartfelt and very challenging

00:30:25.257 --> 00:30:29.628 align:middle line:84%
conversations, I was able
to meet with the women

00:30:29.628 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:84%
privately, meet
with the mullahs,

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:35.867 align:middle line:84%
and in a kind of breakthrough
they allowed the women to dig.

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:39.337 align:middle line:84%
And the women spent the
better part of a year

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:41.773 align:middle line:84%
and a half digging and
digging and digging

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:44.176 align:middle line:84%
with shovels and
ropes and buckets.

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:45.911 align:middle line:84%
And they hit an
underground lake.

00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:50.182 align:middle line:84%
And it saved 75,000
people in 17 villages.

00:30:50.182 --> 00:30:52.117 align:middle line:90%
And now there's water storage.

00:30:52.117 --> 00:30:53.919 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:30:53.919 --> 00:30:55.887 align:middle line:90%
And that's that place.

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Those are the children
of that region.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.859 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's an
incredible, incredible time

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:90%
in their history.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.063 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever wonder why
you are in the middle

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:06.398 align:middle line:90%
of these types of things?

00:31:06.398 --> 00:31:07.899 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: I have no idea.

00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:09.434 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever
think about that?

00:31:09.434 --> 00:31:10.736 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at you.

00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:12.003 align:middle line:90%
This is just one of the slides.

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.105 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's amazing.

00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:16.374 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: That just
blows my mind, too.

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:17.442 align:middle line:90%
I can't explain it.

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:19.444 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you actually
one thing I do say

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:23.081 align:middle line:84%
when I have the opportunity,
and you're giving it to me,

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:27.886 align:middle line:84%
that I have chosen to live
what I call a committed life.

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:32.557 align:middle line:84%
And a committed life is a
life where your commitments,

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:35.594 align:middle line:84%
your deepest commitments, they
wake you up in the morning.

00:31:35.594 --> 00:31:36.695 align:middle line:90%
They tell you what to wear.

00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:84%
They tell you what to
do and where to go.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.466 align:middle line:84%
Rather than your wants
or even your needs.

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:43.168 align:middle line:90%
And it just changes everything.

00:31:43.168 --> 00:31:46.471 align:middle line:84%
And I could never have
dreamed of working side

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:47.639 align:middle line:90%
by side with Mother Theresa.

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:50.308 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have targeted
that and made it happen.

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:53.278 align:middle line:84%
But out of taking a
stand in world hunger,

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.815 align:middle line:84%
out of taking a stand
to really bring forth

00:31:56.815 --> 00:32:01.219 align:middle line:84%
a thriving just and sustainable
way of life, that promise,

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:05.056 align:middle line:84%
that commitment has taken me all
over this extraordinary planet.

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:06.825 align:middle line:84%
It has me be sitting
here with you.

00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:08.426 align:middle line:90%
And it had me go to Senegal.

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.195 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I couldn't
have planned that.

00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:12.330 align:middle line:84%
If I'd done that one
thing with my life,

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.066 align:middle line:84%
I would've been living
a life worthy of--

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:16.601 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of course,
if we all would

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.303 align:middle line:84%
have done just one
thing like that.

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:19.905 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
I'm talking about.

00:32:19.905 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm
talking about in terms

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.841 align:middle line:90%
of making a difference.

00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:26.378 align:middle line:84%
Now here you are in the clinic
with Mother Theresa, right?

00:32:26.378 --> 00:32:30.048 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: This is a orphanage in
Calcutta where Mother Teresa's

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:33.118 align:middle line:84%
mother house is, and
an orphanage where

00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:34.953 align:middle line:84%
they take only
girls, because girls

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:38.023 align:middle line:84%
are the unwanted sex in
that part of the world

00:32:38.023 --> 00:32:40.826 align:middle line:84%
also still, but not as
much as it was then.

00:32:40.826 --> 00:32:44.796 align:middle line:84%
And those are baby girls
on little like gymnastics

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:46.932 align:middle line:84%
mats in Mother
Teresa's orphanage.

00:32:46.932 --> 00:32:51.803 align:middle line:84%
And through The Hunger Project I
had so many amazing privileges,

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.239 align:middle line:84%
and one of them is to get
to know and work directly

00:32:54.239 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Teresa.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.842 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a picture of
you working directly with her.

00:32:56.842 --> 00:32:58.476 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: She was a
great teacher for me

00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and really, truly everything
you wanted her to be times 10.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.949 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was
just one of the gems

00:33:03.949 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that you took away
from that experience?

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Or your experience with her?

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:13.525 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, she
taught me so much.

00:33:13.525 --> 00:33:17.896 align:middle line:84%
She taught me to have
compassion for people of wealth.

00:33:17.896 --> 00:33:21.132 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is a really odd thing
to learn from Mother Teresa,

00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:24.736 align:middle line:90%
but I have a natural love.

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:30.008 align:middle line:84%
I have almost unlimited,
unbounded compassion

00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:32.577 align:middle line:84%
for the underdog,
for people living

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:34.512 align:middle line:84%
in resource poor
circumstances, for people

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:35.947 align:middle line:84%
that other people
would call poor,

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:37.983 align:middle line:84%
I would never call them
that, because I know them

00:33:37.983 --> 00:33:39.618 align:middle line:84%
and I know that
they're not poor.

00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:41.987 align:middle line:84%
They're rich in so
many ways and it's

00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:44.756 align:middle line:84%
their circumstances
that are poor.

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:47.792 align:middle line:84%
And in a session I had with her
were some very, very wealthy

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:52.797 align:middle line:84%
people who were very over the
top, entitled, and arrogant,

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:56.067 align:middle line:84%
and kind of bossy and rude,
interrupted our meeting.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:59.771 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself being so
angry with them internally.

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:01.006 align:middle line:90%
My blood was kind of boiling.

00:34:01.006 --> 00:34:02.474 align:middle line:90%
And she was kind to them.

00:34:02.474 --> 00:34:04.075 align:middle line:90%
And they were not kind to her.

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:06.378 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine someone not
being kind to Mother Teresa,

00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:07.879 align:middle line:84%
but these people
were not kind to her.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:08.545 align:middle line:90%
They were rude.

00:34:08.545 --> 00:34:09.813 align:middle line:90%
They were nasty.

00:34:09.813 --> 00:34:11.949 align:middle line:90%
They were ugly with her.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And when they left
this precious meeting

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.922 align:middle line:84%
I was having with
Mother Teresa, it

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:20.958 align:middle line:84%
was my first encounter with
her, my first meeting with her,

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:27.431 align:middle line:84%
I saw that she had no
animosity towards them.

00:34:27.431 --> 00:34:30.268 align:middle line:84%
She extended the same love,
compassion, kindness to them

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:32.536 align:middle line:90%
as she did to me and to anyone.

00:34:32.536 --> 00:34:33.871 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't do that.

00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:37.309 align:middle line:84%
And so when I left, I went
back to my hotel in Delhi.

00:34:37.309 --> 00:34:40.110 align:middle line:84%
This was in Delhi, the meeting
at her orphanage in Delhi.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a
letter to her saying

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.716 align:middle line:84%
that I'd gotten the greatest
teaching of my life seeing

00:34:44.716 --> 00:34:48.018 align:middle line:84%
her interact with people
who were so nasty,

00:34:48.018 --> 00:34:49.254 align:middle line:90%
arrogant, entitled.

00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:52.456 align:middle line:90%
I actually hated these people.

00:34:52.456 --> 00:34:58.496 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that it's
easy to have compassion,

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:03.301 align:middle line:84%
for me, for people who
are in a place of need.

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:06.571 align:middle line:84%
But that one of the
things that I needed to do

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:08.974 align:middle line:84%
was expand my
circle of compassion

00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:11.009 align:middle line:84%
to include the very,
very, very wealthy.

00:35:11.009 --> 00:35:15.447 align:middle line:84%
Because the vicious cycle of
wealth can be as intractable

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and as suppressing as a
vicious cycle of poverty.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never even
thought that thought.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.723 align:middle line:84%
And it broke me through
to a whole new level

00:35:24.723 --> 00:35:27.092 align:middle line:84%
of my own compassion
and kindness

00:35:27.092 --> 00:35:30.929 align:middle line:84%
for people caught in
sometimes the tyranny

00:35:30.929 --> 00:35:32.931 align:middle line:90%
of excess resources.

00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:33.765 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:34.399 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:36.501 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Really, really
interesting teaching from her.

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:37.335 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:35:37.335 --> 00:35:37.969 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:39.704 align:middle line:84%
She taught about
compassion for all.

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:40.538 align:middle line:90%
She really did that.

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Did not
leave anyone out.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.844 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the wealthiest,
bossiest, rudest people

00:35:45.844 --> 00:35:47.078 align:middle line:90%
need our compassion as well.

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:47.779 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:51.082 align:middle line:84%
And now this is a picture
of you in Bangladesh?

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: That's in Bangladesh.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.986 align:middle line:84%
Bangladesh is one of the
countries that I most love

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:55.887 align:middle line:90%
and respect.

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:58.823 align:middle line:84%
There's a resilience in the
people of Bangladesh given

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:01.826 align:middle line:84%
the intensity of the
population of that country.

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:03.128 align:middle line:90%
And they live in the low lands.

00:36:03.128 --> 00:36:05.497 align:middle line:84%
It used to be all
rainforest and it's

00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:07.198 align:middle line:90%
been completely deforested.

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:08.833 align:middle line:90%
And it's often flooded.

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.935 align:middle line:84%
You read about that
quite frequently.

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:14.639 align:middle line:84%
And people seem to have the
capacity and the courage

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.408 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild their life
over and over again.

00:36:16.408 --> 00:36:18.743 align:middle line:84%
And I love, love, love
the people of Bangladesh.

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:21.179 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've learned so many
lessons from so many people

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.381 align:middle line:84%
that you get to share
with us and bring to us.

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:24.649 align:middle line:90%
And then this is a picture--

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:25.683 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: That's in Ghana.

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:28.219 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, people in Ghana
almost have blue black skin.

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:29.320 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.489 align:middle line:90%
I love the Ghanaian people.

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:36.394 align:middle line:84%
And this is a place where I was
where Women's World Banking was

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:40.031 align:middle line:84%
really created by Esther
Ocloo, Dr. Esther Ocloo, who

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:44.235 align:middle line:84%
was a very, very modest
rural woman who created

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:47.138 align:middle line:84%
a whole worldwide
movement of microcredit

00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:50.542 align:middle line:84%
along with the Grameen Bank in
Bangladesh and other places.

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:53.578 align:middle line:84%
And this a meeting
of some of the women

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:57.182 align:middle line:84%
who were being trained
in understanding money.

00:36:57.182 --> 00:36:59.484 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
never really had it.

00:36:59.484 --> 00:37:02.454 align:middle line:84%
So that they could
manage their small basket

00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:04.956 align:middle line:84%
weaving business or
their microcredit center.

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:07.292 align:middle line:90%
A very inspiring encounter.

00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:11.029 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is

the net center where

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:20.205 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of training
going on that we were doing.

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:23.408 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have definitely
had an amazing-- this is just

00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:84%
a small quarter of
what you've experienced

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.479 align:middle line:90%
and it's been incredible.

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:30.148 align:middle line:84%
So with your experiences
and all of this

00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:33.818 align:middle line:84%
led you to eventually
the Amazon rainforest?

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:35.253 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, The
Hunger Project,

00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:38.189 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was going to
be for the rest of my life.

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:40.758 align:middle line:84%
Ending world hunger's
kind of a big to do.

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:43.561 align:middle line:84%
You can't really check
it off all that fast.

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:47.899 align:middle line:84%
And I became The Hunger Project
is really more accurate.

00:37:47.899 --> 00:37:49.501 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a job for me.

00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:51.069 align:middle line:90%
It was who I was.

00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:54.906 align:middle line:84%
And I was responsible
for hundreds of thousands

00:37:54.906 --> 00:37:56.641 align:middle line:84%
of volunteers all
over the world.

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't
imagine anything else.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.813 align:middle line:84%
And then this call came
from the rainforest

00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:06.718 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up with my husband
being in the rainforest

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:08.453 align:middle line:84%
and the Pachamama
Alliance got born there.

00:38:08.453 --> 00:38:11.656 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, just
to be transparent,

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:14.459 align:middle line:84%
I resisted doing
something different.

00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:17.529 align:middle line:84%
I was so dedicated
to what I was doing.

00:38:17.529 --> 00:38:18.396 align:middle line:90%
But I got malaria.

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:21.733 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, malaria
is a terrible disease.

00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:22.634 align:middle line:90%
I don't recommend it.

00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:26.004 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we're felled
at exactly the right time

00:38:26.004 --> 00:38:30.175 align:middle line:84%
by an illness that gives us that
downtime to recreate our lives.

00:38:30.175 --> 00:38:31.476 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened to me.

00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:31.943 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:38:31.943 --> 00:38:32.377 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:38:32.377 --> 00:38:32.777 align:middle line:90%
So that was--

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.279 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: So I'm very, very
grateful for that illness.

00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:35.914 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've turned that
into so many different things.

00:38:35.914 --> 00:38:37.448 align:middle line:84%
And all that you've
made a difference

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:39.684 align:middle line:90%
for to people around the world.

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:42.654 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our listeners are
chiming in with their Facebook

00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:44.956 align:middle line:84%
posts about how they've made
a difference in the world.

00:38:44.956 --> 00:38:48.426 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is taking
their bike to work.

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:51.296 align:middle line:84%
There's walking to the
store, not buying plastic,

00:38:51.296 --> 00:38:54.432 align:middle line:84%
starting a recycling
program at your school,

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:56.634 align:middle line:90%
Nancy at her company.

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:57.602 align:middle line:90%
So many different ways.

00:38:57.602 --> 00:38:59.637 align:middle line:84%
Keep those coming in,
because they in turn

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:01.105 align:middle line:90%
inspire other people.

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:06.144 align:middle line:84%
So I want to show the people
another clip from the Awakening

00:39:06.144 --> 00:39:07.979 align:middle line:90%
The Dreamer video.

00:39:07.979 --> 00:39:12.817 align:middle line:84%
And this is also showing how
now is such an important time

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:15.553 align:middle line:84%
and how this is the time in
history where people need

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:18.523 align:middle line:84%
to know it's about
a mind shift as well

00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:20.091 align:middle line:90%
as doing these physical things.

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:22.527 align:middle line:84%
It really is mostly
about a state of mind

00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:25.129 align:middle line:84%
that you experienced
when you had the malaria

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:27.565 align:middle line:84%
or when you went through
these different cultures

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:29.701 align:middle line:84%
and experienced what
they had to go through.

00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:32.036 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look at that and see

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:36.975 align:middle line:84%
what it means to really
shift your mindset.

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.645 align:middle line:10%
-From the very beginning,
our indigenous partners

00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:42.413 align:middle line:10%
told us that it was
really, really great

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.616 align:middle line:10%
that we were working with
them in the Amazon shoulder

00:39:44.616 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:10%
to shoulder.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.019 align:middle line:10%
But that was only
half the battle.

00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:49.754 align:middle line:84%
They told us that
if we really wanted

00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:52.190 align:middle line:84%
to protect their
lands permanently,

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.693 align:middle line:84%
we would need to go to work
in our part of the world.

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:57.962 align:middle line:84%
And as they put
it, we would need

00:39:57.962 --> 00:40:00.765 align:middle line:84%
to change the
dream of the North,

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:03.568 align:middle line:90%
the dream of the modern world.

00:40:03.568 --> 00:40:06.804 align:middle line:84%
A dream rooted in
consumption and acquisition,

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:08.973 align:middle line:84%
without any regard
to the consequences

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:13.144 align:middle line:84%
to the natural world
or even our own future.

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.946 align:middle line:10%
-Out of our work
with them, we came

00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:17.615 align:middle line:10%
to see that we in
the modern world

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:22.987 align:middle line:10%
truly are in some kind of a
trance, living a dream that's

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:26.157 align:middle line:10%
threatening not only the
rainforest and their way

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:29.961 align:middle line:10%
of life, but the health and
well being of the entire planet.

00:40:34.966 --> 00:40:36.668 align:middle line:84%
-So in response to
the request that

00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:38.636 align:middle line:84%
came from its
indigenous partners,

Actually, one of our
Facebook listeners

00:41:02.694 --> 00:41:06.164 align:middle line:84%
is asking, "How do you balance
living a life of impact

00:41:06.164 --> 00:41:08.533 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time
making a difference?"

00:41:08.533 --> 00:41:09.667 align:middle line:90%
Julie is asking that.

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:11.202 align:middle line:90%
So how have you done that?

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:14.305 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I think
there's something

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:18.009 align:middle line:90%
that I've learned about balance.

00:41:18.009 --> 00:41:20.378 align:middle line:84%
That we sort of misunderstand
what that is, I think.

00:41:20.378 --> 00:41:23.047 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
a teeter totter.

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:26.918 align:middle line:84%
If you ever have balance,
it's kind of boring.

00:41:26.918 --> 00:41:29.253 align:middle line:90%
You want to go up and down.

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:30.988 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I live on
either side of balance.

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:32.357 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever really
hit that middle.

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:32.924 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Yeah.

00:41:32.924 --> 00:41:35.259 align:middle line:84%
Life is really just
so juicy if you're

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:38.696 align:middle line:84%
willing to see it that way and
live in a state of wonderment

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:40.331 align:middle line:90%
rather than want.

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:45.236 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of constant siren
song of needing and wanting

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:49.574 align:middle line:84%
more and needing to
accumulate and acquire.

00:41:49.574 --> 00:41:53.578 align:middle line:84%
If we could actually
begin to see our lives

00:41:53.578 --> 00:41:57.715 align:middle line:84%
to be known for what we allocate
rather than what we accumulate,

00:41:57.715 --> 00:42:00.818 align:middle line:84%
what we give rather
than what we hoard,

teachers now his Brother David

Steindl-Rast.

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:13.131 align:middle line:84%
And he has this
really cool thing.

00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:17.468 align:middle line:84%
He's the living icon of
gratitude and gratefulness.

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:18.803 align:middle line:90%
And I was in a meeting with him.

00:42:18.803 --> 00:42:20.171 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to tell
this one little story.

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:21.038 align:middle line:90%
Can I do that?

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.807 align:middle line:84%
Because it kind of
answers that question.

00:42:22.807 --> 00:42:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And gratitude and gratefulness
are so key to life today

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and really key to living
a fulfilled life, frankly.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.315 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Brother
David once what's

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:33.751 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
gratitude and gratefulness?

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:37.221 align:middle line:84%
And he's this wonderful
85-year-old Benedictine monk

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.824 align:middle line:84%
who just-- everything he says
just you want to write it down.

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:41.726 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "That's a
great question, Lynne."

00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:45.897 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Gratitude
has two great branches.

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:47.598 align:middle line:90%
One is gratefulness.

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:49.667 align:middle line:90%
The other is thanksgiving.

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:53.104 align:middle line:84%
Gratefulness is the experience
of life, when the bowl of life

00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:57.708 align:middle line:84%
is so full that it's almost
overflowing, but not quite.

00:42:57.708 --> 00:43:01.145 align:middle line:84%
It's so full that it's
absolutely bowed at the top

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:04.649 align:middle line:84%
but not yet dribbling over the
edges of that bowl of life.

00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:10.087 align:middle line:84%
And that's the experience of
the great fullness of life.

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in the
great fullness of life,

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.793 align:middle line:84%
you're one with God, you're
one with the universe.

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.395 align:middle line:90%
There is no other.

00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:20.198 align:middle line:84%
And it's so fulfilling
that the bowl of life

00:43:20.198 --> 00:43:22.934 align:middle line:84%
overflows and suddenly
becomes a fountain

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:25.403 align:middle line:84%
and you move over to the
other branch of gratitude,

00:43:25.403 --> 00:43:26.838 align:middle line:90%
which is thanksgiving.

00:43:26.838 --> 00:43:30.641 align:middle line:84%
And the bowl of life is a
constant fountain of bounty.

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you're so
grateful that there's

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.212 align:middle line:84%
an other, because
all you want to do

00:43:34.212 --> 00:43:37.715 align:middle line:84%
is share and contribute
and give and make

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:38.883 align:middle line:90%
a difference with your life.

00:43:38.883 --> 00:43:40.785 align:middle line:84%
And that's so
fulfilling that that's

00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:43.421 align:middle line:84%
put you in the great
fullness of life."

00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:45.656 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You can
live your whole life

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:48.459 align:middle line:84%
in the two branches
of gratitude."

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.695 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
answer to that question.

00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:52.096 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So where
she's asking was

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.564 align:middle line:84%
how do you balance
the-- I didn't

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:54.966 align:middle line:84%
ask the question
quite correctly.

00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:57.368 align:middle line:84%
How do you balance
the art of giving

00:43:57.368 --> 00:44:00.471 align:middle line:84%
with still being
able to make money?

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:04.909 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying if your cup
is overflowing with fullness,

00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:07.478 align:middle line:84%
that it will continue to
come to you because you're

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:10.348 align:middle line:90%
in that place of generosity.

00:44:10.348 --> 00:44:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I think I'm
answering a different question

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:13.718 align:middle line:90%
than she asked.

00:44:13.718 --> 00:44:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So let me go a little
bit more to her question.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.524 align:middle line:84%
I actually think
that if you really

00:44:19.524 --> 00:44:22.059 align:middle line:90%
follow what's yours to do.

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:27.965 align:middle line:84%
You know they say
follow your bliss.

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.867 align:middle line:84%
There's this
wonderful other quote

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that says don't ask
what the world needs.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.775 align:middle line:84%
Ask what makes your heart sing
and what makes you come alive.

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:39.143 align:middle line:90%
And do that.

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:42.813 align:middle line:84%
Because what the world needs is
people whose hearts are singing

00:44:42.813 --> 00:44:44.549 align:middle line:90%
and people who've come alive.

00:44:44.549 --> 00:44:46.918 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, I
invite you to find a way

00:44:46.918 --> 00:44:51.389 align:middle line:84%
to earn that's consistent with
what makes you come alive.

00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:53.624 align:middle line:84%
And in the earning, you'll
be making a difference.

00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:55.059 align:middle line:90%
It's not an either/or.

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:57.562 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was also wondering
the same thing is that then how

00:44:57.562 --> 00:45:00.965 align:middle line:84%
do you make, if you're
in financial trials

00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:02.867 align:middle line:84%
or if you're losing your
house, and you really

00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:06.837 align:middle line:84%
want to be able to give,
how do you teach that?

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:11.842 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Well, I think there's
always a space and grace

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:12.543 align:middle line:90%
to give.

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.612 align:middle line:84%
It's always there even
if you have nothing.

00:45:14.612 --> 00:45:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
another wonderful quote

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.282 align:middle line:90%
that I can't remember properly.

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:21.285 align:middle line:84%
But it's a Tagore
quote, where people

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:25.523 align:middle line:84%
who have the least amount
are often the most generous.

00:45:25.523 --> 00:45:26.591 align:middle line:90%
And it's really true.

00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It's that sense of
generosity does not

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:84%
depend on having more
than you need or doesn't

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.231 align:middle line:84%
depend on any
amount of anything.

00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:36.901 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very
concept or what

00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:39.303 align:middle line:84%
I call distinction
of sufficiency,

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:41.472 align:middle line:84%
enoughness or the
experience of enough

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:43.307 align:middle line:90%
isn't an amount of anything.

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:45.676 align:middle line:84%
It's an experience
of being deeply

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:48.779 align:middle line:84%
grateful for what
you already have.

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:53.884 align:middle line:84%
Instead of wanting what you
don't have, to love what you do

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:56.153 align:middle line:84%
have is the source
of real prosperity.

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:56.988 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not kidding.

00:45:56.988 --> 00:45:58.422 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds so
kind of Pollyannaish.

00:45:58.422 --> 00:45:59.223 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, it makes sense.

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.024 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: It is so true.

00:46:00.024 --> 00:46:01.092 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It makes
sense with everything

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about, Lynne.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.395 align:middle line:84%
All the way back to
the Pachamama Alliance

00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:05.396 align:middle line:90%
and The Hunger Project.

00:46:05.396 --> 00:46:07.365 align:middle line:84%
It all circles together
because it's really

00:46:07.365 --> 00:46:09.100 align:middle line:90%
all part of the same thing.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.869 align:middle line:84%
Giving back to each other,
giving back to the rainforest,

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:15.539 align:middle line:84%
giving back to the people
who don't have enough

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:20.144 align:middle line:84%
and circling back to
yourself of receiving.

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:22.847 align:middle line:84%
There's a great clip on
your "Soul of Money" website

00:46:22.847 --> 00:46:25.116 align:middle line:84%
that is really great
about generosity.

00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I want people to check this out.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:27.151 align:middle line:90%

that anyone can do.

-Learning to be
generous really has

00:46:36.394 --> 00:46:38.062 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with economics.

00:46:38.062 --> 00:46:42.066 align:middle line:84%
-Even a smile to
someone who looks sad.

00:46:42.066 --> 00:46:46.037 align:middle line:84%
-Listening deeply is an
amazing act of generosity.

00:46:46.037 --> 00:46:48.039 align:middle line:84%
-You have to experience
it to really understand

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
how it changes the
way you see the world.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.777 align:middle line:84%
-If you're simple, if
you are service hearted,

00:46:52.777 --> 00:46:55.212 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
sense of surrender,

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:57.782 align:middle line:84%
and accepting things
as they are, not

00:46:57.782 --> 00:47:00.651 align:middle line:84%
always as you want
them to be, then I

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:04.221 align:middle line:84%
think you can really
engage in a lifestyle that

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:06.057 align:middle line:90%
is rooted in generosity.

00:47:06.057 --> 00:47:08.626 align:middle line:84%
-There's nothing you need that
you don't have to be generous.

00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:14.331 align:middle line:84%
-The smile cards
really encourage

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:19.603 align:middle line:84%
people to think in small,
daily, very easy to do terms.

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:24.041 align:middle line:84%
-I actually used a smile card
to switch seats with someone

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:26.343 align:middle line:84%
on a plane, because
for whatever reason

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:30.047 align:middle line:84%
I got surprisingly
upgraded to first class.

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:35.019 align:middle line:84%
There was this older
lady in the coach class

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:36.187 align:middle line:90%
who had just sat down.

00:47:36.187 --> 00:47:39.056 align:middle line:84%
She looked very tired
and in need of some rest.

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:41.525 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, oh,
can we switch seats?

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.327 align:middle line:90%
She was so happy.

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:45.296 align:middle line:84%
-You can be generous
in those small moments.

00:47:45.296 --> 00:47:47.298 align:middle line:90%
And that's really what life is.

00:47:47.298 --> 00:47:50.901 align:middle line:84%
-The only way to get there
is not to be consumed by me,

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:53.037 align:middle line:84%
but to be really
concerned about the we.

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:32.243 align:middle line:84%
We've got some great

and leaving it there.

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:40.217 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to fly

This is great.

00:48:46.157 --> 00:48:47.992 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
I wanted to happen,

00:48:47.992 --> 00:48:49.760 align:middle line:84%
was a way for people

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.829 align:middle line:84%
and to make a
difference and to really

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:55.299 align:middle line:84%
do something on an active
level rather than just talking

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:56.033 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.635 align:middle line:84%
As we mentioned at the
beginning of this show,

00:48:57.635 --> 00:49:00.104 align:middle line:84%
there's a difference between
talking about it and doing it,

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:01.338 align:middle line:90%
and it's easy.

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:02.139 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to do.

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:03.741 align:middle line:90%

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:59.330 align:middle line:84%
like that will give you
hundreds and hundreds,

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.299 align:middle line:84%
and Pachamama too,
hundreds of examples.

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:04.368 align:middle line:90%

to know that it's

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.711 align:middle line:90%
so easy to take a paper bag.

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to take no bag
or bring your little canvas

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.050 align:middle line:90%
bag to the store.

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:56.053 align:middle line:84%
I always touch the homeless
people I encounter.

00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.655 align:middle line:84%
Because homeless
people, they wouldn't

00:50:57.655 --> 00:50:59.857 align:middle line:84%
be out there if they
were connected really

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:02.026 align:middle line:84%
to somebody that
cared about them.

00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:04.895 align:middle line:84%
So they say they want
money, but what they really

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:06.897 align:middle line:84%
want is they want to
connect with somebody

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and have a little conversation
with them from time to time

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.302 align:middle line:90%
when I can.

00:51:11.302 --> 00:51:14.638 align:middle line:84%
Things like that,
they seem so little.

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:18.175 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, what happens
is they change your life.

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:21.145 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel
different about yourself

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:22.313 align:middle line:90%
and the whole world.

00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:24.982 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman come and see me
after I wrote "Soul of Money,"

00:51:24.982 --> 00:51:27.818 align:middle line:84%
and she said, I have
$150,000 of credit card debt.

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:28.686 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

00:51:28.686 --> 00:51:29.186 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:31.355 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: And the interest
is just killing me.

00:51:31.355 --> 00:51:32.122 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:34.725 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a financial expert.

00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:37.194 align:middle line:84%
I know about people's
relationship with money.

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:40.331 align:middle line:84%
And I told her to do something
kind of seemed so unrelated

00:51:40.331 --> 00:51:40.998 align:middle line:90%
to her.

00:51:40.998 --> 00:51:44.368 align:middle line:84%
But I said for the
next seven days,

00:51:44.368 --> 00:51:48.038 align:middle line:84%
make a difference with
every single person you see.

00:51:48.038 --> 00:51:51.141 align:middle line:84%
So when you're at the cleaners,
compliment or acknowledge

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:53.711 align:middle line:84%
the person who brought
you your cleaning.

00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:55.879 align:middle line:84%
Say something nice
about their hair.

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.815 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the
grocery line, let

00:51:57.815 --> 00:52:00.417 align:middle line:84%
someone who has fewer
things than you go ahead

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:01.952 align:middle line:90%
of you if they're in a hurry.

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Do as many acts of kindness,
make as many differences

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:08.959 align:middle line:84%
as you can each day for
the next seven days.

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:11.095 align:middle line:84%
Don't do anything
about your debt.

00:52:11.095 --> 00:52:14.164 align:middle line:84%
And then she came back
to me and I'll just

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:16.934 align:middle line:84%
say the day that she
came, she was a person

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:20.004 align:middle line:84%
who was-- she was
$150,000 in debt.

00:52:20.004 --> 00:52:21.038 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She was her debt.

00:52:21.038 --> 00:52:21.739 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: She was her debt.

00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:22.306 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:52:22.306 --> 00:52:25.009 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: When she came back the
next Monday, it was a Monday,

00:52:25.009 --> 00:52:27.911 align:middle line:84%
she was a human
being who loved life,

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:84%
who could feel she
made a difference.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:32.449 align:middle line:90%
And she had $150,000 in debt.

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:33.817 align:middle line:90%
So then we could talk about it.

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:34.218 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the difference.

00:52:34.218 --> 00:52:36.286 align:middle line:84%
This is the inspiration
that you serve.

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:39.189 align:middle line:84%
Just those little tidbits and
the enormous amount of impact

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.058 align:middle line:90%
that you've made on this planet.

00:52:41.058 --> 00:52:42.226 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:52:42.226 --> 00:52:43.193 align:middle line:90%
>>TWIST: Oh, thank you.

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:43.927 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lynne Twist--

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:45.529 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: It's been
a joy to be here.

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:47.564 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's been honor for me.

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:48.665 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:49.767 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: You light
up the world, too.

00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:50.334 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're just going
to have a love fest here.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.938 align:middle line:84%
>>TWIST: Shining
your light on me

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:56.206 align:middle line:90%
and allowing my light to shine.

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.608 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And keep those
smile cards coming through.

00:52:57.608 --> 00:52:59.877 align:middle line:84%
Someone is going to pay
the next person's toll.

00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:02.046 align:middle line:90%
So that's fabulous.

00:53:02.046 --> 00:53:04.114 align:middle line:84%
All right, well, thank you
so much for joining me.

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:05.682 align:middle line:84%
