00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is
Dr. Baskaran Pillai.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.160 align:middle line:84%
He is a spiritual scientist,
an academic scholar,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:90%
and a world thought leader.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We had an interview with
Dr. Pillai here on Gaiam TV.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
opportunity for him

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:84%
to join us again because
I had so many more

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
questions about realizing our
huge, beautiful, full human

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, you had mentioned
something slightly

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:90%
about doing a blessing.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
you call Shaktipat.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BASKARAN PILLAI: Yeah.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.965 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could you explain
what Shaktipat is?

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Shakti is energy.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the Sanskrit word
which means the energy.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.555 align:middle line:90%
Pat is transmission.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
This is something I
told Wayne Dyer, too.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.695 align:middle line:84%
I can give a talk for
two hours, three hours.

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:90%
It's an intellectual exercise.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.150 align:middle line:84%
You may or may
not appreciate it.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:90%
And then you leave.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:84%
But Shaktipat is something
where no words are used.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.059 align:middle line:90%
It is a transmission.

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:90%
It is my intention.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.086 align:middle line:84%
It is the intention
of the teacher

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
to go and enter the
consciousness of the students

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
to make changes in
his consciousness.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.604 align:middle line:90%
So silently, without words.

00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is what happened when
I said in the last interview

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that Carl Jung went to
see the Raman Maharshi,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.605 align:middle line:90%
and no words were uttered.

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he said he was in
a profoundly altered state

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By being
in the presence?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.748 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: By being
in the presence.

00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.429 align:middle line:84%
So you can make the
person's kundalini to rise.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
When I move this, I
can catch the kundalini

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:90%
and then raise it.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, you can.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.854 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:31.354 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.915 align:middle line:90%
By the power of your intention?

00:02:36.915 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Yeah, by the
power of my intention.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
It depends on certain
conditions, the receptivity

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
of the student, and
the student's level

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.405 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and
also the teacher's level.

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So that is important to
take into consideration.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I read once
that it's essentially

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:90%
a transfer of a seed of energy.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
I'm talking about,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:84%
where it's like a seed
of energy that you're

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
transplanting into
the other person?

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain
that a little more?

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: It's my intention--

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the seed.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:84%

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And also the raising
of the kundalini.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
The kundalini is the energy
that stays in sixth chakra,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.840 align:middle line:90%
and below it too.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.992 align:middle line:84%
And when I raise it,
and I bring it up,

00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:48.552 align:middle line:84%
bring it up, and then go
to the third eye, and then

00:03:48.552 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:90%
the crown chakra.

it's about a minute or two.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Yeah people have
to only focus on that.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It is on my YouTube videos.

>>LISA: So in this video,
your eyes changed shape?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you do that by
slowing down the REM movement

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:90%
in your eyes?

I don't remember even
if I ask them to do it.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in the beginning, I
say, this is Particle Darshan.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:90%
And it was a while ago.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:90%
So I don't remember.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.289 align:middle line:90%
But there is one.

way to start a meditation,

rapid eye movement?

00:07:16.364 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Yeah, you could keep
your eyes completely still,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.710 align:middle line:84%
no thoughts will
come to the brain.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.529 align:middle line:84%

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was born with that
ability to do that.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And your
teachers, did they

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.912 align:middle line:84%

>>PILLAI: Well, in India--
it's a magical country.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:90%

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:84%
You can go to my

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they will-- you
just give your thumbprint.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.855 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is asked.

00:08:02.855 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Then there are scriptures there,
written thousands of years ago.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And from that,
they will find out

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
your name, your father's
name, your mother's name.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you're married,
your husband's

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
name, and what you are
doing for a living,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.735 align:middle line:90%
and why you are suffering.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:90%
All these things will be there.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
They won't know
anything about you.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%

this not being from India?

>>PILLAI: Yeah, you can
do it on Skype also.

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:90%
I just introduced that.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.868 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:08:39.868 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: You can
do it on the Skype.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It is called astroved.com.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is it?

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.478 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Astroved.com.

00:08:47.478 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
All that you need to do
is you just send your--

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.255 align:middle line:84%
if you are a woman,
left thumbprint.

00:08:57.255 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:84%
If you are a man,
the right thumbprint.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.495 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:03.012 align:middle line:84%
You just scan it, and
then send it to them.

00:09:03.012 --> 00:09:04.595 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
set an appointment.

00:09:04.595 --> 00:09:07.155 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And only certain
people can do that

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.585 align:middle line:90%
who are born in that family.

00:09:10.585 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And they have the
leaves, palm leaves,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
on which everything
was written to you.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness!

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: In a very
coded language.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.326 align:middle line:90%
So they will come.

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And then they will ask you.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I once had in
New York 500 people

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:90%
watching this on the video.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.275 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness,
watching it live?

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Watching it live.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.537 align:middle line:84%
I can do it for
you on a show, too.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.314 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Anybody can do it.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to be present.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And why the
left finger-- thumb

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:84%
for the woman and
right for the man?

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: I don't know why.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't know?

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is a family, a
lineage of family members

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:90%
that have this gift?

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: There
about maybe totally

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
about less than 200
people who can do that.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.967 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:02.967 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Are you one of them?

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.595 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: No, I'm not.

00:10:05.595 --> 00:10:07.954 align:middle line:84%
These are people
who work for me.

00:10:07.954 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the ashram?

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.225 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: In the ashram, yeah.

00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.185 align:middle line:84%
What is your ashram
called in India?

00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It is a
private one that I

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:90%
don't allow other people.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.965 align:middle line:84%
Because even here, I don't
allow public to come.

00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:90%
It is only a very closed one.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:29.445 align:middle line:84%
But then I have services
rendered through two websites.

00:10:29.445 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
One is pillaicenter.com.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.802 align:middle line:90%
And the other is astroved.com

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't believe in
opening my esoteric teachings

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And those people who
are committed to me,

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:90%
they have access to it.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's a closed setting.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And why is
your choice for that?

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.192 align:middle line:84%
What is your choice
in doing that?

00:10:55.192 --> 00:10:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It's because
people have to be ready.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's not, you know, like, I
truly believe Jesus is saying,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:84%
don't throw the pearls
before the swines.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a waste of time.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
In your experience as
a spiritual teacher,

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
do you find that
there are people

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that will follow you
and only follow you

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.422 align:middle line:84%
without going on and
living their lives?

00:11:23.422 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
That they will just
dedicate themselves--

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: No, my
teaching is 200% life.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain.

00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: 100% material
and 100% spiritual.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:41.649 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to leave
your profession or business

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:44.065 align:middle line:84%
or anything that you are doing
in order to be enlightened.

00:11:44.065 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
You can do everything
that you want

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.515 align:middle line:90%
to do and still be enlightened.

00:11:52.515 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's just
a lopsided reality.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Look at the Buddha's reality.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.200 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha could
have been a king.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
He was the only
heir to the throne.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But he elected to become
an ascetic and a recluse.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.694 align:middle line:84%
That is not a model
agreeable to me.

00:12:12.694 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not
condemning the Buddha.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:90%
He's a great being.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:90%
But that's what he chose to do.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.385 align:middle line:84%
He chose to leave his wife,
his son, and his father

00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:23.995 align:middle line:90%
and kingdom.

00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But my model is that you
can do it both together.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:90%
That is my lineage.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
My lineage, all the Siddhas,
we are married people.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:90%
And then they live this life.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
also simultaneously

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:90%
live the other world, too.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're still
in constant contact

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:90%
with your wife and your child?

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Of course.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I have a daughter who
is grown up and married.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And did she go on to
study your tradition as well?

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Well, she's a
professor in a law school.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:90%
So she does her thing.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.785 align:middle line:90%
But she is spiritual, too.

00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:01.349 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's wonderful.

What is your overarching goal?

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:90%
What did you come here to do?

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: I just came here

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that through changing your
mindset, or consciousness,

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
which is basically changing
how the brain works,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.105 align:middle line:84%
you can change anything
that you want to change.

00:13:29.105 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:90%
You can heal your body.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:90%
You can change your finances.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:84%
You can also fix
your relationships.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
All these things, these are
the major areas of human life.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.977 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you have to
want it first, don't you?

00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Of course.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want it first,
then nothing can be done.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a choice
that people make.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But sometimes people
don't know what they want.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.439 align:middle line:84%
As you said, they don't
have any prior knowledge.

00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:84%
They're just living
in the suffering.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: But everybody
wants a nice home.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants a little bit
of cash for them to spend.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And everybody wants
a good relationship.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.065 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't want
it, then it's difficult.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:90%
They have to want it.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:90%
They have the want.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's not a
big deal, because everybody,

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
if you ask anybody, do you
want to live in poverty,

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:84%
or do you want to
live in abundance?

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going to say, no,
I just want a Rolls Royce.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I want a Ferrari.

well-- in your case,

>>LISA: Mhm.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: His guru came and
told him the previous night,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:84%
there is a building
waiting for you.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Go get it.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:84%
That was the only building
where the Hollywood stars were

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
staying at that time because
there were no five star

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:90%

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:90%
The guru had come and told him.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
By the time Paramahansa
had come here,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
had no visa, nothing,
there was a woman

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:84%
was driving him around
and telling him,

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:90%
what are you looking for?

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for the building
that my guru had shown me

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:90%
in a dream.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.625 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you thinking?

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.115 align:middle line:90%
This is a really posh area.

00:15:54.115 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Are you in your mind?

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.656 align:middle line:84%
He said, I am not in
my mind, of course.

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So when he came to this
building, he said stop.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.135 align:middle line:84%
This is the building
I want to buy.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:84%
You can go and look
at the building.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
It was used to play tennis
and everything there

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.055 align:middle line:90%
in that building.

00:16:16.055 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It was gorgeous, gorgeous
building with a lot of land.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And he had no money, literally
no money to buy that building.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:90%
So the lady-- he bought it.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's a long story.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Well,
he asked the lady

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:84%
to stop the car to find
out if it is for sale.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
She came back and
said, it is for sale.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Then I will buy it.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:90%
And how did he do it?

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.551 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: He used
to heal people.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:90%
So he healed some rich people.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.310 align:middle line:90%
And some money came.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:90%
At that time, it was $40,000.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Today, it would be like-- that
building will be like $10,

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:90%
$20 million.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.570 align:middle line:90%
And there were challenges.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And then he had--
Of course, the house

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:17.516 align:middle line:84%
was in like a 90 day--
what do they call?

00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Escrow?

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.574 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Escrow, 90 day escrow.

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:90%
Time was running out.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:90%
He could not get the $5,000.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The last $5,000?

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: The last,
$35,000 he was able to pay.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the $5,000 was
really a big problem.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, he called--
a woman called from Boston.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
I have the $5,000.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But I have to drive from
Boston to Los Angeles.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.684 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To give it to you.

00:17:46.684 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: To give it to you.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
But then you'll run out of time.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:90%
But he called the owner.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:84%
The owner said, I want to
give it to you, regardless.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Although I have a better offer,
but I don't want to do that.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:90%
I want my building to go to you.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And he-- this is the
most important point.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
The lady who was
driving him asked him,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:90%
how did you manage to do this?

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Because I believed in it.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.112 align:middle line:90%
And you didn't believe in it.

00:18:13.112 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%

somebody else doesn't.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.695 align:middle line:84%
Who is responsible

00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:26.786 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.786 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: That happens most
of the time between couples.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It's really ironic
and painful, too.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%

you are off the wall.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I have so many

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%

>>PILLAI: And they

were to intend the well being

But it still can be done.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It depends upon

police department of DC

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
that we will bring
down the crime

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:90%
rate by 25% in three months.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Just 3,000 people sitting
in one place and meditating

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:40.295 align:middle line:84%
brought down 25% percent of
the crime in Washington, DC.

00:21:40.295 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a scientific fact.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And now the police department

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.046 align:middle line:84%
So group consciousness
is very, very important.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.039 align:middle line:90%

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:90%

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ego, yes.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It's because of
ego, which is ignorance.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
To me, it doesn't
matter whether it

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.665 align:middle line:84%
is a Muslim group
or a Christian group

00:22:22.665 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%

Bahai or whatever group,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Native American group.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:90%
They all can join together.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And then let them
do whatever they

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:84%
want to do because they
are calling on God.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.205 align:middle line:84%
And God understands

Then the frontal lobe, which

am just $10, or $20.

00:23:07.426 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:90%
And I have a bad relationship.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't look good.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:90%
And then I am overweight.

Aging is time.

This is what I hear

There's a lot of

come with the body
breaking down.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: You arrest time.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:84%
If you arrest time, stop
time, then everything

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
happens, whether it's
changing your money situation

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
or your relationship
or your health.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything will change if
you just stay in the now.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And the now is the
absence of the mind,

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:90%

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So if that you do, it
is just a make believe.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:90%
The mind is a make believe.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And we all do that.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.942 align:middle line:84%
When we go to
sleep, what happens?

00:26:03.942 --> 00:26:04.775 align:middle line:90%
The mind disappears.

00:26:04.775 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:90%

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: See, the mind creates

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the mind conceives
of, let's say, $1 billion.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.900 align:middle line:90%
That also a limited reality.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But it cannot do
anything to the body.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Now you will be a billionaire.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I know so many
billionaires with cancer.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.105 align:middle line:90%
And then they are crying.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I think a person who is
very healthy with no money,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.975 align:middle line:84%
his life is better off than
having cancer and money.

>>PILLAI: He's a party animal.

00:27:39.969 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a very
bad concept of God.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:84%
In the Hindu tradition,
it's very different.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:52.177 align:middle line:84%
There is Krishna, who is a
dancer and who is a musician.

00:27:52.177 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:90%
And he has a lot of girlfriends.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:90%
That bothers a lot of people.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.285 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.285 --> 00:28:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And there is another god who is
a dancer, Shiva, Dancing Shiva.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So without dance and music,
the life will be miserable.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So we are talking about this

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.220 align:middle line:90%
This is a lot of fun here.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you just put
God on a pedestal

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and then conceive of him, well,
God is here, and money is here.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:90%
God is not a killjoy.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:84%
We have created a
God who is a killjoy.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:90%
He's not a killjoy at all.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:90%
He loves fun.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.252 align:middle line:90%

Or she?

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Or are we God?

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes, yes we are.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.690 align:middle line:84%
God created man
in his own image.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
If God looked like someone,
he looks like the human being.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:84%

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you mean by that?

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.085 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: So I am
is not the ego.

00:29:15.085 --> 00:29:16.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:84%
It is the capital letter I
am, where you don't associate

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:29.230 align:middle line:84%
yourself with the individual,
small self, but with a God.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.050 align:middle line:90%
So the I am is God.

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.406 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.406 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:90%

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Capital I.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Capital I.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Versus Lisa, which
is a small I. It is not that.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:90%


00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:84%
A small I is identity
with what you are doing,

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and what are the events
here in this world.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But the bigger I is you
identify yourself with God.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Like Jesus said, me and
the father are the one.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.750 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.690 align:middle line:84%
That got him into
trouble because people

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:84%
thought he is
claiming to be God.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.330 align:middle line:90%
So it's a blasphemy.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:90%
It got him into trouble.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But the truth was-- then he
changed the language and said,

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I am not God, but I
am the Son of God.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And even then, the Jews
didn't believe him.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.769 align:middle line:90%
They said, maybe.

00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It was a story, again, I think
of showing us who we can be

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and that when we
separate ourselves

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:84%
from that God within us
is when we feel suffering.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:35.854 align:middle line:90%


00:30:35.854 --> 00:30:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Separation
is suffering.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.061 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Separation.

00:30:38.061 --> 00:30:39.160 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And then how could we then get
back-- if you realize that,

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
how can you get back
into that alignment of--

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Changing your
mindset through meditation.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Through meditation,
you dissolve your mind.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.335 align:middle line:84%
You dissolve your
I consciousness.

00:30:57.335 --> 00:30:58.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you
ever recommended

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:90%
a meditation saying, I am God?

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: I have
not done that one.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I have so many other
meditations that I use.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, can you
explain some of them?

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Of all the
meditations that-- I

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:84%
know about 1,000
meditation techniques.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:32.410 align:middle line:84%
The most powerful technique
are using the sound waves,

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.170 align:middle line:90%
using the mantras.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.910 align:middle line:90%


00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.210 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there
is a mantra that I

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.170 align:middle line:90%
use for people to get wealth.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a mantra that was
given to me specially

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.160 align:middle line:84%
in the special scriptures I
talked about where you get

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:84%
your name, father's
name, mother's name.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
In one of the
scriptures, it came to me

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:84%
that this particular Yogi
meditated for 1,500 years

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and then found out a particular
sound that will give you money.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Because he
was a king previously.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted to give
money to all his citizens.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was no money to
give it to all his citizens.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:90%
So he went into meditation.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And in that meditation,
the goddess of wealth

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.540 align:middle line:84%
came and told him,
this is the sound.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.080 align:middle line:84%
If people use this
sound, then they

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.680 align:middle line:90%
will be able to manifest money.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And that sound is
brzee, B-R-Z-E-E.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.900 align:middle line:90%
It's there on my YouTubes, too.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I experimented this with
so many people, even

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.245 align:middle line:90%
with a financial institution.

00:32:44.245 --> 00:32:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:84%
One financial institution,
I can't say the name, so

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:84%
that particular division, the
director said to me, well,

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:middle line:84%
this division is
under my control.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.090 align:middle line:84%
There are 30 people--
senior people working here.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.880 align:middle line:90%
How can we do this?

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.755 align:middle line:84%
I said, get up 5:00
in the morning.

00:33:08.755 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And for two hours,
do this technique.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.930 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So the boss got up,
and then on the phone.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And they will all chant
this sound, brzee.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.485 align:middle line:90%


00:33:23.485 --> 00:33:23.985 align:middle line:90%
Brzee!

00:33:23.985 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Brzee!

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Brzee!

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Brzee!

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.976 align:middle line:90%

Brzee!

00:33:33.765 --> 00:33:35.307 align:middle line:90%
For two hours.

00:33:35.307 --> 00:33:35.890 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:84%
While they were doing that,
another company came forward,

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.295 align:middle line:84%
another international
company this is also

00:33:44.295 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:84%
an international company, we
want to buy this division.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.607 align:middle line:84%
He told the director,
can you bring your team?

00:33:53.607 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.540 align:middle line:90%

And I also will give
money to other people

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:06.723 align:middle line:90%
according to their levels.

00:34:06.723 --> 00:34:08.451 align:middle line:90%

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.199 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: 12, 13
years ago, I was

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:84%
blessed with a very powerful
mantra to attract money.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And it came directly
from Vishwamitra.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:50.335 align:middle line:90%
Vishwamitra used to be a king.

00:34:50.335 --> 00:34:55.469 align:middle line:84%
And he was upset with
the fact that he was not

00:34:55.469 --> 00:35:02.835 align:middle line:84%
able to make every one of
his citizens to be affluent.

00:35:02.835 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So he could not
find any way that he

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:84%
could do it other than
through his spiritual method.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:90%
So he went and studied.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a long story.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:25.580 align:middle line:84%
But then he became
a rajarishi, a king

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:84%
as well as a rishi, who
was able to create anything

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and everything through
his consciousness.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.960 align:middle line:90%


00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:48.015 align:middle line:84%
He came through a palm
leaf and gave me a mantra,

00:35:48.015 --> 00:35:51.930 align:middle line:90%
a sound called brzee.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And it took several hours for
the mantra to come through.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:84%
You just can go and look at
the entire list of mantras.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:09.220 align:middle line:84%
You won't find brzee, B-R-Z-E-E.
And he said that I should have

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:13.670 align:middle line:84%
the name of brzee, and currently
Lakshmi is known by brzee.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Then whoever works with this
mantra will get all the wealth

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:90%
they want.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:90%


00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I did assume the
name for some time.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.815 align:middle line:84%
And then I am more
hard-nosed, again,

00:36:27.815 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:90%
to really think I am to be.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:90%


00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:33.970 align:middle line:90%
I used it for a long time.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:90%
And I changed.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So I discontinued using
that or even promoting that.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.060 align:middle line:90%


00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But later on, again, as
destiny would have it,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that I came back to it
about a year and a half

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:84%
ago, because I'd found
incredible success that people

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:57.600 align:middle line:84%
were getting from the
use of the sound brzee.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
People became millionaires and
bought houses for $18 million.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:90%


00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Some even named their
homes after brzee

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
because there was a tremendous
amount of power in that sound.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The other video that
you mentioned to me was about

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.610 align:middle line:90%
the, uh, the--

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: See, another thing,
this is a very important point.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I have been able to help
people to become millionaires.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Some millionaires have
also become billionaires.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.330 align:middle line:90%


00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:34.200 align:middle line:84%
But what is difficult
for me to do

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.260 align:middle line:84%
it is to make a
person who is making

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.150 align:middle line:90%
$2,000 to even make $2,500.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.967 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: That I
have to confess,

00:37:45.967 --> 00:37:51.280 align:middle line:84%
because-- it is
because of karma.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, let's
talk about that.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Yeah, karma
is very, very key.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a very key concept.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.985 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha did not
believe in God.

00:38:00.985 --> 00:38:02.640 align:middle line:90%
He did not believe in a soul.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:90%
But he believed in karma.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:90%
What is karma?

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:90%
The mindset is karma.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:84%
These people who
are making $2,000

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:19.160 align:middle line:84%
has a very strong mindset that
they are not able to change.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.270 align:middle line:90%
And that is what is karma.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Don't think it is a
metaphysical concept.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Karma is simply a mindset.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:30.210 align:middle line:84%
If you can change that mindset,
then you can just move on.

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.930 align:middle line:90%
But the mindset is so strong.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.560 align:middle line:90%


00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.260 align:middle line:90%
And where is it?

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It is, again, in the frontal
lobe, because this is the law.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's
attached to the ego.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.909 align:middle line:90%


00:38:41.909 --> 00:38:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: You are
strongly, strongly,

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.210 align:middle line:84%
strongly believe
that I am $2,000.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I cannot, in the
world, make $2,500.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this what the people
that are stuck in a certain

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.389 align:middle line:84%
economic level are-- you
consider this is they're--

00:38:56.389 --> 00:38:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: It can be
like for people--

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.120 align:middle line:84%
like $5,000 people,
$10,000 people.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:90%
They have the same, too.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.830 align:middle line:90%
They cannot get beyond that.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.792 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, right, no
matter how hard they try.

00:39:06.792 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: No matter how hard.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.220 align:middle line:84%
That's way I teach these
karma removal techniques.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.690 align:middle line:84%
There is this mantra
called Thiru Neela Kantam.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:90%


00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
videos on that, too.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So you visualize the
blue light on the throat.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And then keep on chanting this
mantra, Thiru Neela Kantam,

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.325 align:middle line:84%
Thiru Neela Kantam,
Thiru Neela Kantam.

00:39:33.325 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You do it two hours, and then
definitely, the consciousness

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.270 align:middle line:90%
will change.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Your mindset will change.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And, interestingly,
there was somebody

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.895 align:middle line:84%
who was given a Nobel
Prize this morning I

00:39:45.895 --> 00:39:49.045 align:middle line:84%
saw because he has
worked on the blue light.

00:39:49.045 --> 00:39:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And the blue light is
a miraculous light.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.780 align:middle line:84%
The blue light can
change your karma.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.576 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:40:00.576 --> 00:40:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: The blue light,
if we visualize blue light,

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and maybe put blue lights in
the house or the bedrooms,

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.510 align:middle line:84%
this will change
your consciousness.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:14.436 align:middle line:84%
The mindset will be
changed by the blue light.

00:40:14.436 --> 00:40:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about the color
blue, wearing the color blue?

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Yes, the blue
color, whether we wear,

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:23.137 align:middle line:84%
it will definitely
change your mindset.

00:40:23.137 --> 00:40:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting!

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.166 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting!

00:40:25.166 --> 00:40:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: So that's
the most important.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I am committed to
the people who are

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:36.625 align:middle line:84%
unable to get beyond $3,000,
$4,000, or even $10,000.

00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Health, this can be applied
to the field of health also.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, can it really?

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
there's health karma?

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yes.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.580 align:middle line:90%
There is health karma.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.070 align:middle line:90%
There is wealth karma.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.260 align:middle line:90%
There is relationship karma.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.307 align:middle line:90%


00:40:48.307 --> 00:40:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
video that Dr. Pillai

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.200 align:middle line:84%
does where he's talking
about Thiru Neela Kantam.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.226 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at it.

00:40:56.226 --> 00:40:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Karma is basically
responsible for all

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.710 align:middle line:84%
your problems, and as well
as for your success as well.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Whether you have financial
problem, a relationship

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.760 align:middle line:84%
problem, or health problem,
they're all due to karma.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.975 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very
important that you

00:41:21.975 --> 00:41:28.240 align:middle line:84%
keep an eye on
resolving your karma.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have spoken
extensively on karma

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:36.300 align:middle line:84%
when I started making
YouTube videos.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So once a day, you
should go and do

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:84%
the karma busting video
clips because karma

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.455 align:middle line:90%
is a very powerful force.

00:41:54.455 --> 00:41:55.930 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.930 --> 00:42:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It will not allow
you to make money

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.530 align:middle line:90%
if you don't have money karma.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.975 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be sitting
like a zombie.

00:42:06.975 --> 00:42:08.300 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And you will have no
concept of time passing by.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.070 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:18.550 align:middle line:84%
The same with the
health karma, too.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.390 align:middle line:90%
The health will be failing.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And you will not do
anything about it.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:32.245 align:middle line:84%
In every area, karma
has its own strong hand.

00:42:32.245 --> 00:42:33.720 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And you have very little
freedom on a conscious level

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to counteract it unless you go
and use this sound, Thiru Neela

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Kantam.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.215 align:middle line:90%
That is very powerful one.

00:42:49.215 --> 00:42:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And I also prescribe the sacred
ash as a karma removing device.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:02.925 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of information on

So without the

00:43:12.537 --> 00:43:13.620 align:middle line:90%
there will be no progress.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.430 align:middle line:90%


00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:84%

biggest complaint that people

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.724 align:middle line:84%
come to you about, or

00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Money.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Money.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Universally, this
is what you have?

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Universally, money
is the number one problem.

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:30.335 align:middle line:90%


00:43:30.335 --> 00:43:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it is truly
so, because if you have money,

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:84%
you can deal with the
stress in different ways.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have money,
it's really crippling you.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.440 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.895 align:middle line:84%
That's why money is
the number one problem.

00:43:52.895 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.320 align:middle line:84%
If you have so many problems,
at least if you have money,

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:84%
you can just go to Switzerland
and spend some time,

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.174 align:middle line:90%
and then come back here.

00:44:02.174 --> 00:44:03.580 align:middle line:90%


00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people who are
fighting in the same house,

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:11.924 align:middle line:84%
and the reason why they are
staying in the same house is

00:44:11.924 --> 00:44:13.465 align:middle line:84%
they cannot afford
a second mortgage.

00:44:13.465 --> 00:44:15.910 align:middle line:90%


00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:17.350 align:middle line:90%
The guy can't go.

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:20.295 align:middle line:84%
So he has to really
live in the same house.

00:44:20.295 --> 00:44:21.229 align:middle line:90%

interesting-- well,

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.730 align:middle line:84%
why not just address
the relationship

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.320 align:middle line:84%
rather than getting
another house?

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult, because
there are children involved.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:33.070 align:middle line:90%
And there are so many problems.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But money can solve
all the problems.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.880 align:middle line:84%
You can have the children and
the bad husband or bad wife,

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:90%
and still get out.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:39.970 align:middle line:90%

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Happiness is
something inside you.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And money helps to buy toys and
pleasure and things like that.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is something you can--
that is a matter of the soul.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Because
you are detached.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.230 align:middle line:84%
You are detached because
you only love the person.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
You love the person because that
person, for whatever reason,

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.875 align:middle line:84%
you created that person
in the first place.

00:45:19.875 --> 00:45:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You attracted them?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.872 align:middle line:84%

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, but you don't
hate them, hate that person.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.400 align:middle line:90%
You are detached.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.815 align:middle line:84%
And if there is money, you

here, take my money.

00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:34.740 align:middle line:90%

reliant upon that other person

00:45:37.339 --> 00:45:38.130 align:middle line:90%

00:45:41.326 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So many people say, that

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Or that person upsets me.

>>PILLAI: That's the problem.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.086 align:middle line:84%
You are responsible for your
own happiness or unhappiness.

00:45:50.086 --> 00:45:51.780 align:middle line:90%


00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.260 align:middle line:84%
You should not depend

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.169 align:middle line:90%

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.550 align:middle line:84%
When you know that your

You are creating everything.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Then why do you want

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I am just completely sovereign.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.540 align:middle line:90%

>>PILLAI: Yeah, I'm sovereign.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And I control my own
destiny, own state.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And if that person
is not helping me,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that's-- it's not
going to affect me.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:24.849 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:26.890 align:middle line:84%

the other person can do--

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: All that
I do is I create

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:33.720 align:middle line:84%
an environment in which the

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.320 align:middle line:90%
bother me.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why money
is very important,

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.960 align:middle line:84%
because that money
gives you the ability

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.260 align:middle line:90%
to do whatever you want to do.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what I used

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.140 align:middle line:84%
If you have money, then you
can go and tell your boss

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.389 align:middle line:90%
what you really think about him.

00:46:53.389 --> 00:46:55.555 align:middle line:84%

tell that to your spouse?

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: Because his spouse
is a different situation.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.069 align:middle line:84%
You have to live with her,
with the spouse all the time.

>>LISA: Right, yes.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: The boss is
a different situation.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.285 align:middle line:90%
You are committed to the spouse.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you want

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:16.650 align:middle line:84%
that you would want to help
that spouse, regardless,

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.096 align:middle line:90%

come and help that person.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness!

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And is that god accessible
to anyone of any faith?

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:14.294 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Yeah, anyone.

00:49:14.294 --> 00:49:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Any religion,
it doesn't matter?

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.600 align:middle line:90%
That's so interesting.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.400 align:middle line:90%
And, wow!

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.615 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
that you still want?

00:49:24.615 --> 00:49:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Is there say anything that
you, Dr. Pillai, want?

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Me?

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PILLAI: I want a world
without any suffering

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:37.165 align:middle line:90%
for anyone of any race.

00:49:37.165 --> 00:49:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.834 align:middle line:90%
No diseases.

00:49:41.834 --> 00:49:44.285 align:middle line:90%
This is my prayer.

00:49:44.285 --> 00:49:51.910 align:middle line:84%
My prayer is it doesn't make
sense for anyone to suffer,

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.065 align:middle line:84%
either financially,
physically, relationship-wise.

00:49:54.065 --> 00:49:55.180 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.180 --> 00:50:01.450 align:middle line:84%
People should live life in
abundance, and in happiness,

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and in God.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.570 align:middle line:90%


00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:06.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful way to end.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for spending
so much time with us, even

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:13.152 align:middle line:84%
though it really
isn't time to you.

00:50:13.152 --> 00:50:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PILLAI: Thank you.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.
