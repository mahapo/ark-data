00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and we're broadcasting from the
Sounds True Wake Up Festival

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.110 align:middle line:84%
in the beautiful Rockies
surrounding Estes Park,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Colorado.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So my guest today experienced
tonic seizures for 25 years,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.100 align:middle line:84%
where in many cases her
heart would just stop,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.200 align:middle line:90%
and she had to be resuscitated.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Lisa Wimberger taught
herself to combine meditation

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and neuroscience to
create the process that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
would help her retrain
her nervous system.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:90%
She calls this neurosculpting.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.009 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA WIMBERGER: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:90%
So neurosculpting.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.981 align:middle line:84%
You had to teach yourself this
out of a necessity to live.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.188 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I had a lifelong
experience and relationship

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
with seizures that went
undiagnosed for most of my life

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:90%
until I was 30.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So I would have these
seizures and wake

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:84%
up in places-- in
the bathroom wedged

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:90%
between the toilet and the tub.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:90%
I'd wake up with black eyes.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.925 align:middle line:90%
I would have bumps on my head.

00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:90%
But as I got--

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.745 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No idea of
what was happening?

00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: No.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.529 align:middle line:90%
No idea.

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did it-- any
onset cues or clues?

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I would have
a few seconds of uh oh,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:90%
something is not right.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And at first they were
short; they were more

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:90%
like fainting spells.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:84%
My first one at 15, I
recovered very quickly.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.844 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:90%
My friends were there.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:90%
They helped me up.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.049 align:middle line:90%
I felt fine.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What was it from?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.589 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
it was caused from?

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Well,
at 15 on my birthday

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I was hit by lightning
in the base of the spine.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.799 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did
that feel like that?

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: That was horrible.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.596 align:middle line:84%
That felt like a
sledgehammer just smashing

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:90%
into the base of the spine.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Another friend was with me.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
He also got hit.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the group of
friends that were around us

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.042 align:middle line:90%
were in shock and reacting.

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
know what happened.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe them
when they told me

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
we had catapulted off the wall
that we were leaning against.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
were hit, you were hit.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.859 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They saw a ray of
lightning come down, and--

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Well, we
heard the crack of thunder,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.108 align:middle line:90%
and then there was lightning.

00:02:20.108 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
I'm on the ground, and so

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:90%
was the boy who was next to me.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And they all told us this
story that we were hit

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and we had flown off the wall.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really know
if that was true or not,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:84%
but my watch had stopped
precisely at that moment.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
maybe this is true.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:90%
But I'm conscious.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.512 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So did you feel
the impact, hurt, anything?

00:02:46.512 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge jolt to
the base of my spine

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
as though someone had
taken a sledgehammer.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.665 align:middle line:90%
And I was sore.

00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:90%
But I was conscious.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I was functioning.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And from my
interpretation of what

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
it must be like to
be hit by lightning,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't possibly have been.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.005 align:middle line:90%
I don't have scorch marks.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:10.660 align:middle line:90%
My hair was already curly.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So I thought maybe this
wasn't exactly that.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But shortly after that
I start blacking out.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
That was the summer I
started having the blackouts.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.614 align:middle line:84%
That weekend I had my
first fainting spell.

00:03:23.614 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you ever
say to the doctors,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I was hit by lightning?

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: I told my parents.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And when we got back
to my friend's house,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:84%
we all told their parents,
and they didn't buy the story.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.102 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Who
knows what's going

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
on with a bunch of 15-year-olds
who seemingly look fine.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So I had some episodes of
blacking out that summer,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and my parents did
take me to a doctor.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Having not witnessed
a blackout, they

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:84%
were just going off me
saying I was blacking out.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%
They took me to a doctor.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They did a blood test
for I don't know what,

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and said she's fine.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.680 align:middle line:90%
She's low blood pressure.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe she's
hormonal, or maybe she

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.177 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have enough
salt in her diet.

00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:08.135 align:middle line:90%
So it went undiagnosed.

00:04:08.135 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I
was 17-ish, I wasn't

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
recuperating very
quickly from them.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
So I remember one time in the
bathroom-- normal morning,

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and my face in the
mirror starts melting.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
this is not right.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And I hear my voice yell, no,
as though someone else were

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:90%
yelling it.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I don't remember
being on the ground.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
But I had an entire experience
in my mind going on.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:90%
I was somewhere else.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I awoke to excruciating
pain through my body,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
pins and needles,
and I'm in a puddle

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:90%
on the ground in the bathroom.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking did I urinate?

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Now I can't get up.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:90%
And I can't walk.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So this was the first time
the fainting became something

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
now I can't recuperate
so quickly from.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.034 align:middle line:84%
So I had to crawl
back to my bedroom.

00:05:07.034 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What was the puddle?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.622 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.622 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I
didn't find out what

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
the puddle was until I was
30 when it was diagnosed.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But I would wake up in these
puddles with every blackout.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
It turns out the puddle
is from the seizure.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a
tonic seizure, which

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
is to curl inward, and
your muscles contract

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:84%
with everything they have,
and you are curled in,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:84%
your muscles expel
all of their energy.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And you drench all of your
energy out your pores.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you don't hold
your bowels or your urine

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:90%
during this time.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, it was sweat.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:90%
But imagine.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That much?

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.038 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: That much.

00:05:46.038 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So imagine every muscle
you have contracting

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
so hard that they've just
expelled all of their energy.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Now there's nothing to walk;
there's nothing to get up.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:90%
You have no reserves.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've
just spent it all,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.247 align:middle line:84%
and you're completely
unconscious.

00:06:00.247 --> 00:06:01.621 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: You've
spent it all.

00:06:01.621 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:90%
You're unconscious.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when you awake,
you have to mobilize,

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
left to mobilize with.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did your
parents start to see

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
these and witness
these seizures.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: These happened
a few times a year,

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:90%
usually when I was by myself.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And by the grace of a
higher force, at age 30--

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
After having them
happen for so long I

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
just stopped telling
people about them.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's
back up for a second,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:84%
because when you're having
these types of extreme moments,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
do you live in fear of them
happening over and over again?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you live your
life differently

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:90%
as a result of those?

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Absolutely.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I was-- Because the
onset was so random

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and it could not be
tracked to any pattern

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.567 align:middle line:84%
that I could discern,
I was afraid these

00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
would happen all the time.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
One episode came on while
I was driving my car,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't turn
the wheel of the car,

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.315 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't remain conscious.

00:07:03.315 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate enough
to veer off the road.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:90%
I was in fear a lot.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was using meditation at
the time to cope with the fear.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So my rich meditation practice
was really a coping mechanism

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:84%
for the fallout of
all of these episodes.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The fear afterwards,
or right as it's coming on?

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Both.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I was meditating when I was
healthy to deal with the fact

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that I lived a very reserved,
controlled, fear based life.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the fallout after,
during the recuperation,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to try to make sense of this, to
try to convince myself there's

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:84%
nothing wrong with
me, I'm fine, to try

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to move into action
and functionality

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and just brush it off.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.925 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you were
kind of ignoring them?

00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I
was ignoring them.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.487 align:middle line:90%
I'm great at denial.

00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, aren't we all.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
But you actually had-- You
didn't tell anybody about them,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't have any
physical effects afterwards?

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever go
back to the doctor?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever take
seizure medicine?

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.526 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: No.

00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:84%
No seizure medicine,
because the original doctor

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
visit when I was 16, the
blood tests showed nothing.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.165 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So I
just ignored them.

00:08:15.165 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.640 align:middle line:90%
A few friends witnessed them.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
A couple boyfriends would
help me up, you know,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.995 align:middle line:84%
when I would fall and blackout
and wake up with a black guy.

00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I would just sort of brush
them aside and say, I'm fine.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But the gift came in a
doctor's exam when I was 30.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I was in a routine exam,
and I said to the doctor

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:90%
I feel faint.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:90%
One was coming.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:90%
There are seconds, only seconds.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:90%
And here it was.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh I feel faint.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, just lie down.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I lied back,
the episode came,

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was in a completely
other consciousness.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I awoke, I awoke
to the image of a panic

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
stricken doctor--
not what I wanted

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:90%
to see-- leaning over me.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And I remember he
wore a bow tie, which

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:90%
stands out in my mind.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
So he's got this look of panic.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And he has that
needle of Atropine,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:90%
which is adrenalin, right here.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:90%
The scene out of Pulp Fiction.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:90%
I look at him.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
He's shaking.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:90%
His hand is shaking.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
He's about to plunge
adrenaline into my heart.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said you didn't tell
me you had this condition.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And in my denial, I
said what condition

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:90%
are you talking about?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:32.927 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:34.759 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: And he
said, you had a seizure,

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:90%
and you flat lined.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what does that mean?

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:90%
He said, your heart stopped.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get you to breathe.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.250 align:middle line:90%
You were turning blue.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.661 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:43.535 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For how long?

00:09:43.535 --> 00:09:44.257 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.257 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: I don't know.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Long enough for the nurse
to go into the next room,

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
load the needle with
Atropine and come back.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
My guess, maybe that takes
45 seconds, a minute.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:90%
I didn't ask him.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:90%
He was shaken.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:90%
I was shaken.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, well, I'm
in a puddle, did I urinate?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
He said this happens when you
have these types of seizures.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
him, and I said I've

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
been waking up in these
puddles since I was 15.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said you've been
doing this for that long.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And he described the condition
to me, which to his description

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
was called vasovagal
syncope, which

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.767 align:middle line:84%
is a very fancy
term for fainting.

00:10:24.767 --> 00:10:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Except there's a spectrum.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve,
cranial nerve 10,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.460 align:middle line:84%
has a spectrum of
nervous system responses:

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
blushing, light
headedness, embarrassment,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
dropping the heart rate,
flutter in the chest,

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to the very extreme is stopping
the heart to play dead.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a very reptilian
fear response.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: And so he
gave me this diagnosis,

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.691 align:middle line:84%
and he said, well,
it's not epilepsy.

00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.645 align:middle line:84%
Because my EKGs, my
EEGs all came back fine.

00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's
no medication?

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: No medication.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not epilepsy.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:90%
No restrictions.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And what he told
me was the onset

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
was typically, in these
cases, stress or fear.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.235 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Didn't make
sense to you, did it?

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I've been
meditating my whole life.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.537 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing nameable.

00:11:19.537 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it could
be the stress or fear

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
from the seizures.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Right.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
gnawing at the back of my mind

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:84%
saying there's
something there that's

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
causing me to exit in
such a profound way.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask
you, where do you go?

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Oh goodness.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.905 align:middle line:90%
Interesting places.

00:11:37.905 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I've had full visceral
experiences in these times

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.260 align:middle line:84%
where people tell me that
I'm not alive or functioning.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you one example.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:84%
One is comical, which
I was with Elvis.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Not what I expected.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
But one wasv very--
one was comical,

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and one was very different.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I flat lined in
front of my daughter.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:90%
She was three.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:90%
We were in a food court.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
It came on from nowhere.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I think I had bitten
into a chicken bone.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So my recollection of the event
was I bit into a chicken bone,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and I did this, oh
no, my tooth is loose.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:90%
I grabbed her by the hand.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:90%
I walked into the bathroom.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at
myself in the mirror.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm examining my tooth.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I see my daughter
in the periphery.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.417 align:middle line:90%
I feel her hand.

00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
There's blood.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:90%
I taste it going down my throat.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:90%
This is all visceral memory.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:90%
And none of that happened.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I open my eyes to paramedics.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was I bit into
a chicken bone, had a seizure,

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:84%
flipped over backwards,
and flat lined.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.436 align:middle line:90%
But my mind--

00:12:45.436 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Took you
to the bathroom.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Took me through
a logical mental process,

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
a visceral experience,
a somatic experience.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I was troubleshooting what
dentist I would go to.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.835 align:middle line:84%
I was making sure my
daughter had my hand.

00:12:58.835 --> 00:13:00.592 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.592 --> 00:13:02.425 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
remember from the episode.

00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: None of that happened.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: No.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how was your
daughter after that?

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.793 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: She was
very traumatized.

00:13:06.793 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know where she was.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.484 align:middle line:90%
And she was off to the side.

00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Someone else had been
in the food court.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And she ran over, and she
put her hand on my-- No,

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
she came next to me, and I
said, put your hand on my chest.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And the paramedics were
working, and she said, mommy,

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:90%
did you die?

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.464 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I
thought, well, I'm not

00:13:26.464 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:90%
ready for that conversation.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: But at
three, after I got out

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
of the hospital that
day, we had to start

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.686 align:middle line:90%
rehearsing 911 scripts.

00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And talking about it.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So this of course
caused you to dive

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
into neurological
functioning, neuroscience.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And you combined it with
your meditation practice.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So how did you-- And
now I want to mention,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the
seizures anymore, right?

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:53.956 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: No.

00:13:53.956 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had a
seizure in five years.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Five years.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And do you think that
you've trained yourself out

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.107 align:middle line:90%
of this permanently?

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:02.815 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.605 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying yes.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
What ended up happening was
the doctor told me there

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:84%
was a thought trigger,
a stress trigger.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So I took that
information, went on

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:84%
to get certificates
in neuro leadership,

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
neurobiology, the study
of synapses and neurons,

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and medical
neuroscience to find out

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
what does cranial
nerve 10 do, and why,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and how can I start
directing through

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.402 align:middle line:84%
positive neuroplasticity a new
message to cranial nerve 10.

00:14:39.402 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this
the same nerve that

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.345 align:middle line:90%
is responsible for Bell's Palsy?

00:14:42.345 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Bell's
Palsy can affect

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's the
trigeminal nerve, which

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.154 align:middle line:84%
is the nerve that
controls facial muscles.

00:14:50.154 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Vagus nerve as well.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Vagus nerve
is lower in the brain stem.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:15:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's down in the medulla
of the brain stem, which

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
controls more of the heart rate
and the reticular activating

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:84%
system of the brain, the
part of the brain that alerts

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
the cortex to wake
up and be conscious.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So this part-- you deciphered
through all of your training

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:90%
the specific nerve.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
You did a lot of
research, I'm sure.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.412 align:middle line:84%
And you came up with the term--
found the term tonic seizures?

00:15:22.412 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Well, the doctor
told me I had tonic seizures.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.328 align:middle line:84%
And when he described
them to me he

00:15:26.328 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:90%
said those were not convulsive.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.271 align:middle line:90%
They were contractive.

00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So I
took my information

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and determined, through
neuroscience's revelations

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
around self-directed
neuroplasticity,

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:84%
that if I could tell a new
story with the right environment

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:84%
of the brain so the
brain would buy it,

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and if I could repeat
that story enough,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I could entrain a
process, a neural network

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:07.525 align:middle line:84%
so well that it would become a
usable tool, a usable response.

00:16:07.525 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally telling
yourself a new story

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:90%
so that you believe it.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Absolutely.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The brain fully
has to believe it.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.605 align:middle line:90%
So how do you do that?

00:16:17.605 --> 00:16:18.505 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.505 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Trial and
error was a big piece of it.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I started doing
after the last two episodes--

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
The one in front of my daughter
was very traumatic for her,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
but the one after that
was most traumatic for me

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't maintain
breathing after that one.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:90%
I was going.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I was making a decision,
I'm not coming back.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.697 align:middle line:84%
And my husband had to
keep re-resuscitating me.

00:16:41.697 --> 00:16:43.655 align:middle line:84%
So after that one I said
I'm going to fix this.

00:16:43.655 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was I went
into meditative states

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
over and over again,
and I realized

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I had to first quiet my
fight or flight mind.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And my fight or flight
mind wants certain things

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:90%
in order to get quiet.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:90%
So had to feed it those things.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I had to feed it
a sense of safety,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
a sense of predictability,
a sense of repetition

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and consistency.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
had to come first

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
before I could tell a new
story, before I could breathe

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:84%
in love, before I
could open the spirit.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:84%
I had to know my needs
were met: the roof

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:23.295 align:middle line:84%
is not going to cave in,
I'm nourished, safety first.

00:17:23.295 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Safety.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.889 align:middle line:90%
What was the other two?

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Consistency.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:26.555 align:middle line:90%
Predictability.

00:17:26.555 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you lived your
life in a very consistent way.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Well,
in my meditations

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to go there to
feed my fight or flight brain

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:90%
what it needed to calm down.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
If the fight or
flight mind can say,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.697 align:middle line:84%
whew, everything is
just as we expect it.

00:17:43.697 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you didn't become a
shut in and live in your house.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.592 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: No.

00:17:46.592 --> 00:17:47.092 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:47.092 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You, in
your meditations,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.962 align:middle line:90%
fed your mind that information.

00:17:49.962 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
That was step one, learning
how to down regulate that.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Step two was how do I access
the part of the brain that

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
can do self-directed
neuroplasticity.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
front of the brain.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And the front of the brain
really loves novelty.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:90%
So I started focusing on--

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stories.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: New aspects,
different aspects of my body

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't normally aware of.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I started going into
places of novelty

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and priming my brain so that
I could now tell a new story,

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and my prefrontal
cortex might believe it.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And my fight or flight mind
wouldn't get in the way

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and say, no, no, no.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you told
your mind that-- What

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
do you mean new
parts of your body?

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
neuroplasticity of the brain.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:90%
The brain loves something new.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So the brain likes to learn
through novel stimulation.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Here I am in a
meditation, I'm relaxed,

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and now I want to novelly
stimulate my brain.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I want it to focus on things
I don't normally focus on

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
so my brain says,
ooh, what's that?

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So I will imagine a tiny
centimeter of skin right

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.070 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of my right knee.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, what does that feel like?

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Never felt that before.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
What if I drew my awareness
to the underside of my tongue?

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:90%
What would that feel like?

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Oh, what if I drew my awareness
to the back of my ear?

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just
random areas of my body,

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.390 align:middle line:84%
wondering with curiosity
what is that like there.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So I am giving a lot
of attention fodder

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.660 align:middle line:84%
to the front of my brain so it
can just start getting engaged

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:90%
and waking up.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.434 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I brought in
images of random things,

00:19:39.434 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
like the cutest
little puppy would

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.735 align:middle line:84%
walk in the room in my
mind's eye, and I would say,

00:19:43.735 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:90%
oh that's so cute.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm stimulating this novel
sense of directed awareness.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm entraining an ability.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.650 align:middle line:90%
So I'm priming the brain.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But now I have the task
of creating a new story.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
The old story was, when I
have a wave coming at me,

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I seize, I freeze, and I die.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So
that's the old story.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:90%
I need a new story.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.746 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I don't know
what's making me seize or freez,

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:90%
or die, so I can't go there.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But I can go to
option B. I fight.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:90%
I scream.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:90%
I kick.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:90%
I punch.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:90%
What if I did that?

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So in my mind I'd
prime my brain.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:90%
I'd relax it.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd stimulate this novel
sense of attention,

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'd rehearse a script that
the next time a wave came,

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:90%
I would be a banshee.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:90%
I would fight it, kick it.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And I rehearsed,
as though I were

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:90%
in a play, a full blown tantrum.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that people
would hear you, assist you?

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.231 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So that I
wouldn't go to the quiet freeze

00:20:55.231 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Unconsious.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:56.595 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:56.595 --> 00:20:57.095 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:20:57.095 --> 00:20:58.167 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.167 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Fight it off.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:90%
I didn't care if it was ugly.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I didn't care if it
was the right response.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:90%
I wanted a different response.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:90%
So I took it, I made it a play.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:90%
I was the actress in the play.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I rehearsed it over
and over again.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.670 align:middle line:90%
I rehearsed it in recuperation.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:90%
I rehearsed it when I felt fine.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I would go into meditations
and rehearse my script.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:90%
How would I act the next time?

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:28.065 align:middle line:84%
And it was about a year later
that I had an episode come on.

00:21:28.065 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:90%
And seconds.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Seconds came.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.860 align:middle line:90%
I was with my husband.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:90%
We were in the car.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed the side of--
I grabbed the door,

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
about to disappear.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And the script kicked in.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:90%
And I screamed like a banshee.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It was ugly.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.950 align:middle line:90%
It was not graceful.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I started punching
the dashboard,

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:90%
punching the door of the car.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:90%
I got out of the car.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:52.845 align:middle line:90%
He pulled over.

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:90%
I got out of the car.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I started ripping
things out of the car,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.264 align:middle line:84%
screaming, not knowing why,
just knowing I'm not fainting,

00:22:00.264 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not seizing.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:01.535 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stay conscious.

00:22:01.535 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Stay conscious.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.118 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: I was conscious.

00:22:03.118 --> 00:22:03.680 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:90%
And then the magic unraveled.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And the magic was suddenly a
narrative came out of my mouth

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that I was not planning that
narrated a very old childhood

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:84%
trauma I have no
recollection of.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So I want to say I don't
know if it were true or not,

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:90%
but it was there.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did you check?

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: I did not.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
it was underneath,

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
whether it was my imagination,
my perception, a real event.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:90%
All irrelevant to me.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
What was relevant was I
entrained to a new response.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:90%
I enacted the new response.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And bubbling up
underneath it all

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
was a narrative that
had been so hidden

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that it was causing
me all of this.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And when that
narrative came out,

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I went into full tremor
shaking, which I now

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
know is a parasympathetic
release of trauma.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:90%
And I shook for hours.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.005 align:middle line:90%
And I felt victorious.

00:23:08.005 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I felt-- I didn't
have a seizure.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was embarrassed for
being so ungraceful about it,

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:90%
but I felt victorious.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
two more episodes

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.622 align:middle line:84%
snuck up during the
years, and I said, oh, I

00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:90%
don't have to go there.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.886 align:middle line:90%
And they just dissipated.

00:23:25.886 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you mind if I asked
what the childhood trauma?

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: The
childhood story was

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:84%
of someone molesting
me in the crib.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.235 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
if that happened.

00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I know enough about
neuroscience to know memory

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is completely fallible
and completely

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.295 align:middle line:90%
an active construction.

00:23:43.295 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So I know enough to say that may
or may not have ever happened.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But the story was there, and the
consequence of the story being

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:54.820 align:middle line:90%
there was real.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:84%
That is an amazing,
amazing story.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So once you came to terms
with that story bubble

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
up and out of you,
the traumatic shaking

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.085 align:middle line:84%
was the releasing of
the energy of the story.

00:24:07.085 --> 00:24:08.085 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Absolutely.

00:24:08.085 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You then faced
these traumas, the seizures,

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:90%
with a different mindset.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Completely
different mindset.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And then they never manifested.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So the two other times
I felt that wave,

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:84%
the wave just dissipated
before it even hit me.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:90%
I felt, oh, it's gone.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:90%
It passed.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.075 align:middle line:84%
It passed like a wave
that I could ride.

00:24:31.075 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You didn't even have to
go do the thought pattern, or--

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I didn't
even have to go to fight.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
It just took once to
physically embody the script

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.162 align:middle line:84%
I had been practicing, and
bam, the whole pattern shifted.

00:24:45.162 --> 00:24:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you still
practice the script?

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.504 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just
neurologically there?

00:24:48.504 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I
believe it's there.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.461 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:24:50.461 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It seems like it.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I practice
a lot of other scripts

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:84%
to help me evolve through
other areas and edges of growth

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:90%
But that script is entrained.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:90%
It's embodied.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.696 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you teach
this to other people.

00:25:05.696 --> 00:25:08.195 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote a book about it
called "Neurosculpting," which

00:25:08.195 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:84%
is-- What is the process
that you teach-- Out

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.410 align:middle line:84%
of that incredible story, what
are the processes that you

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:84%
extrapolated from the story
to actually teach people?

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So what I did
was I distilled the method

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
of the meditation that enabled
me to entrain the new story.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:90%
So I had steps.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Step one, take three
to five minutes

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to calm the fight
or flight center

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.280 align:middle line:84%
by feeding it what
it needs to be calm.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And we go through
at the Institute

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
a series of those things:
predictability, stability,

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
consistency, autonomic
processes, safety.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So in a meditation,
the first three

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to five minutes I am just
having people become aware

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:84%
of gravity, not
wavering, breath,

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.859 align:middle line:84%
repetitious and automatic,
the fact that they're

00:25:56.859 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
nourished enough to be
there, they're safe.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.233 align:middle line:84%
We bring in all sorts
of ways for them

00:26:00.233 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:90%
to focus on their needs are met.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Step one.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Step two.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
We move into let's tease
the prefrontal cortex

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:90%
into a novel activation.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So I have them visit
places in their body

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:84%
they would never have
thought of, obscure places.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I have them notice
how their clothes feel

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.800 align:middle line:90%
against their skin.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I have them remember
a funny joke,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
all things that we know
through neuroscience

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.930 align:middle line:90%
will stimulate this.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The newness,
novelty thing.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.381 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Right.

00:26:28.381 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So now what we've done is
we've shifted the brain dynamic

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
into its most self-directed
neuroplastic state.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.541 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Out of survival into
where it can actually work.

00:26:39.541 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Absolutely.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:90%
So that was step two.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Step three.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.564 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people getting
stuck in their patterns.

00:26:45.564 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:90%
This is about re-patterning.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, many of us can be left
brained, typically associated

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:84%
with logical thought and
details and linear thinking.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Or some of us can be right
brained, typically associated

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:84%
with abstract, no time,
no space experience.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to stay in
either of those defaults.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.066 align:middle line:84%
We're about creating
a new pattern.

00:27:08.066 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So what we do at
the Institute is

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
we use our language
to guide the meditator

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.740 align:middle line:84%
through an alternating
sequence between left

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:90%
and right hemisphere.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.800 align:middle line:90%
So I will use my language.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:90%
I will spell words.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I will count.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I will sequence so that I slam
that person into left brain.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:84%
If I'm spelling, think
of joy, J-O-Y. Suddenly

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.790 align:middle line:84%
the meditator spells
out joy in their mind.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:84%
This is left brain
saying I can participate.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And then right away I move them
into a right brain experience.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:84%
What color, what texture,
what vibration is joy?

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.250 align:middle line:90%
What would joy sound like?

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So we go back and forth
with our languaging.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So the person is
forced, effortlessly,

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.930 align:middle line:84%
to toggle in this alternating
manner so we don't get stuck.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.610 align:middle line:90%
So it gets the brain active.

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Active.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Engaged,
responsive, alert.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: In a way that
wouldn't be their normal way.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're breaking
their pattern simply

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:90%
by toggling them back and forth.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Their normal
way would just

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.165 align:middle line:84%
be their typical left brain
pattern or right brain.

00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Correct.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So
that was step three,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
have them get into a
bi-hemispheric alternating

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:20.790 align:middle line:90%
activation.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.204 align:middle line:90%
Step four.

00:28:22.204 --> 00:28:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that thing is
they're thinking about,

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.780 align:middle line:84%
whatever that thing they've just
attributed a color or a texture

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to, where does that
live in the body,

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:84%
because the body is the
voice of the thought.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So we have them go
through a body scan.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And when they find an
area where they imagine,

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:84%
sense, feel, perceive
that that-- they're

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:50.010 align:middle line:84%
holding that thing, we
have them imagine however

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:53.440 align:middle line:84%
they want to release
it, negotiate it.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we bring in
a somatic awareness.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:84%
We have them tap,
or put their hand

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:84%
there so that we are
embodying emotion

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and a touch and a
sensory motor perception

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to a new perception, which
is I'm releasing this thing.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or I'm safe,
back to safety.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Or I'm safe.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Because when you add in a
somatic motor experience,

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.160 align:middle line:84%
you enhance the plasticity
of the perception

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.300 align:middle line:90%
you are thinking of.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The new memory, the
new thought, the new reaction.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.370 align:middle line:84%
You've broken that
down so precisely.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I could see why, because out
of necessity in your life,

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:84%
you needed to break these
moments down over 25 years

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.051 align:middle line:90%
to figure out how to live.

00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yeah.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
methodical process.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you, people
coming into the Institute

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:43.645 align:middle line:90%
don't want theory.

00:29:43.645 --> 00:29:44.710 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:90%
They don't want theory anymore.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They want a practice that
works, that gives them results.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And until I found
a way to articulate

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
a methodical process,
I had nothing

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:90%
but hope to give someone.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.352 align:middle line:90%
And hope is beautiful.

00:29:58.352 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For a short
amount of time.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: But you have to
know what to do with hope.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Now, the Institute, what is it?

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Well, it is a brick
and mortar, beautiful space

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that is a home for non-dogmatic
healing through this process.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
People come from
all walks of life

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:84%
to study, to take introductory
classes, to do deep dives.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:84%
We have those who are in
high trauma come and study.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Those who want
personal transformation

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:90%
come and learn these techniques.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We also have a
nutritional therapist

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:84%
who teaches about feeding
the body and the brain

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:90%
to support this process.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is the
Neurosculpting Institute?

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.539 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Neurosculpting
Institute in Denver.

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But we have a very robust
online and live stream option.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have students
around the world

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.432 align:middle line:84%
who can take classes
via live stream.

00:30:49.432 --> 00:30:51.015 align:middle line:84%
They just have to
look at the calendar

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and pick which
ones are available.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:90%
We have download audio.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:84%
We have classes now
that we're loading

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:84%
which are downloadable
in MP3 format.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So are people
releasing traumatic memories?

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.585 align:middle line:90%
And you can do this online.

00:31:03.585 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.311 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:31:05.311 --> 00:31:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:06.647 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:31:06.647 --> 00:31:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: And it works.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
safe for people?

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I do
want to qualify that.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.600 align:middle line:84%
In the introductory classes,
some people will unwind.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And we create a safe
environment for that.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.040 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is not
therapy, so we always

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:84%
let people know that
we're teaching you

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.480 align:middle line:84%
a meditative process
that you can apply,

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:84%
but that if you
have deep trauma,

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.580 align:middle line:84%
you may need to
see a professional

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:84%
or use this to support
a therapeutic modality

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.100 align:middle line:90%
you're using.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So I do like to be
clear with people

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.860 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, you can unwind a lot,
and you have to be ready for it

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and have your support
networks in place.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have helped
first responders,

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.875 align:middle line:84%
policemen re-frame
situations for the people

00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that they're helping
or for themselves?

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: For themselves.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.098 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For themselves.

00:31:58.098 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:03.165 align:middle line:84%
When they go to
a site where they

00:32:03.165 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
might be traumatized by
what they see but they have

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to be in action, what
have you taught them?

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So
since 2006, I've been

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:84%
on a mission to teach
law enforcement.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:13.032 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.032 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why specifically
law enforcement?

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: I don't know.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:90%
It came as a heart message.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:22.893 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: And I
didn't question it.

00:32:22.893 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do have
family members who

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.040 align:middle line:90%
I saw traumatized by being NYPD.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:84%
I saw the fallout
with their children.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But I had a very
strong heart message

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to
go help officers.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And I started that
program in 2006.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I've personally,
to date, trained

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
1,200 officers across
the country-- CIA,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
FBI, Secret Service,
some Homeland Security,

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and local Colorado, and
then outside of Colorado.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I train them for
preventative wellness.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:00.816 align:middle line:84%
So officers have the highest
suicide rate of any profession.

00:33:00.816 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Statistics are arguable, but
in general, from two years ago

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.460 align:middle line:84%
the statistics from the National
Police Suicide Foundation

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.040 align:middle line:84%
were that 57 officers
died in the line of duty

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.761 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would expect
that's their greatest

00:33:18.761 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:90%
risk, dying by gunshot, right?

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:90%
57 died in the line of duty.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.225 align:middle line:90%
454 committed suicide.

00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: It's
astronomically disproportionate.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's not-- that is
definitely not reported.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: No.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And now, with the way we see
police officers misbehaving

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:84%
in the media, is
directly why I do this.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:84%
My whole mission is if you have
a pain body, or a trauma story,

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:84%
or if you have seen a
collection of 10 years of crimes

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:84%
against children,
or you go to a call

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's an infant already
dead because of someone

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:84%
who was drunk or abusive, and
you've collected those stories,

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and you've held them
in a container, what

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.890 align:middle line:84%
is your outlook
to another human?

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.989 align:middle line:84%
Might you not
disregard humanity?

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:21.384 align:middle line:84%
So my idea is these people
are carrying loaded guns.

00:34:21.384 --> 00:34:22.560 align:middle line:90%


00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them
behind a loaded gun

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.679 align:middle line:84%
if they can't come
back to center.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they're
driving around in society.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.573 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:31.573 --> 00:34:32.989 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So
my mission was how

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.440 align:middle line:90%
do I get them back to center?

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered in the
process was that these are,

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.340 align:middle line:84%
by and large-- There's always
exceptions to the rule.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.600 align:middle line:84%
There will always be an aberrant
officer who is trigger happy,

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
but by and large, this
is a body of people

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:84%
who have chosen to
support and serve,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and don't know how to deal
with what they're asked to do.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how to cope,
and they've collected trauma,

00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:59.810 align:middle line:90%
and they are traumatized.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And their way out is
to kill themselves.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.957 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do they receive
therapy and training

00:35:04.957 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:84%
when they're training
to be police officers?

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But not to this level
that you're talking about.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:90%
So what do you teach them to do?

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I go
into the agencies,

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and I teach classes
on neurosculpting.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So I teach them how to
recognize their trauma state,

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.360 align:middle line:84%
how to recognize a
stress cycle, how

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to notice what it's doing to
their perception of the world.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I help them notice how
that perception is now

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:90%
the result of a story.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I teach them
the methodical process,

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
how to rewrite those
stories so that they

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:84%
can start releasing their
negativity bias which

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.667 align:middle line:84%
is very quickly
accumulating in their being.

00:35:44.667 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is beautiful.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.727 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip here of you
working with police officers.

00:35:48.727 --> 00:35:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.176 align:middle line:84%
This is Lisa Wimberger looking--
working with police officers.

00:35:53.176 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:59.753 align:middle line:84%
>>Effortlessly, right now, today
is incorporate healthy fats,

00:35:59.753 --> 00:36:06.650 align:middle line:84%
healthy proteins, cut down the
sugars, exercise, and shake,

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and you will change
your ability to deal

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.075 align:middle line:90%
with stress indefinitely.

00:36:10.075 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
If you did that every
day and nothing more,

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
you would be far healthier than
if you didn't do those things.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So now we know that to be
in our fight or flight state

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.975 align:middle line:90%
all the time is detrimental.

00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And it does so at the expense
of our ability to be here.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:34.275 align:middle line:84%
And when we're home from work,
we would like to be here.

00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It would serve us best.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It would help regulate
those hormones,

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.150 align:middle line:84%
help us enjoy life
a little bit more,

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:84%
help us maybe be a little more
relatable to those we love,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.185 align:middle line:84%
and to find a lot more enjoyment
and presence in our day

00:36:49.185 --> 00:36:52.270 align:middle line:84%
to day that doesn't
require us going back

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to an adrenalized state
to feel alive again.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:90%


00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.412 align:middle line:84%
So how do we do this
with mental entrainment?

00:36:59.412 --> 00:37:01.782 align:middle line:90%
Because food can do it.

00:37:01.782 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Exercise can help.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Shaking can help.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And then mental entrainment
is the icing on cake.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may have experience
with mental entrainment

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:84%
where you are
envisioning or rehearsing

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.355 align:middle line:84%
a mental script of how a certain
procedure is going to go,

00:37:20.355 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and you do that over
and over and over again

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.170 align:middle line:84%
so that, eventually
over time, you

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:30.219 align:middle line:84%
can react as though that
script had been practiced.

00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're working off a
script that you rehearsed

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:84%
until it becomes an
effortless, retrievable action

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:90%
or memory in your body.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:84%
This is how we get better
at use of firearms.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:84%
This is how we get better
at playing instruments,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:90%
at playing sports.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:90%


00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Any activity that we
want to get better at

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:59.640 align:middle line:84%
requires us to create
and rehearse scripts.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of those are scripts in
the body, physical motions,

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and some of those
are mental scripts.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.713 align:middle line:90%

survival for officers.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.240 align:middle line:90%
It's an hour long.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And our mission at
the Institute is

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.620 align:middle line:84%
to get resources to officers
outside of the agency

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.650 align:middle line:84%

need to learn resilience?

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And we need to teach
ourselves new stories

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.660 align:middle line:90%
and retrain our neuroplasticity.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.292 align:middle line:90%
How do you teach us to do that?

00:38:46.292 --> 00:38:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: I invite you to
the Institute to take classes.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to look at all
the resources we have online.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We also have a
robust free library

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.594 align:middle line:84%
of neuroscience
articles for people

00:38:55.594 --> 00:38:56.885 align:middle line:90%
who want to educate themselves.

00:38:56.885 --> 00:38:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:90%
And we do that there.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And we also have a team of
certified neurosculpting

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:84%
facilitators who take this
work out to other venues

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and are spreading it
around the country.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you teach
me a few tips when

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I get into a place of
extreme stress or I--

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.460 align:middle line:90%
so I can circumvent that stress.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yeah.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
if you're in it,

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:84%
you're in the
middle of a stress,

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.540 align:middle line:84%
the first thing is to
name what you feel.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So rather than say I am angry--
When you say I am angry,

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.310 align:middle line:84%
you are accessing a very
particular part of the brain.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:84%
When you change the verb
to feel, I feel angry,

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.800 align:middle line:84%
you have activity that
migrates to a different part

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.300 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, which then starts
to down regulate your stress

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's a power in
changing that verb.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.980 align:middle line:84%
There is a neurological change
when you change the verb.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So I would immediately go to I
am angry to I'm feeling angry.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I would start doing some deep
breathing, in through the nose

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.029 align:middle line:84%
and out as much as
possible, because you're

00:40:03.029 --> 00:40:04.695 align:middle line:84%
going to start
mitigating that response.

00:40:04.695 --> 00:40:05.800 align:middle line:90%


00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Third, I would shake
wildly, because you

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.890 align:middle line:84%
don't want to freeze
around the idea

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and repeat it so that
it's in this echo chamber.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Your muscles will
start to contract

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.660 align:middle line:90%
in this stress response.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
maintain that contraction

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:90%
unless you need to use it.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.050 align:middle line:84%
But if this is a
thought, you want

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.460 align:middle line:84%
to shake it in a
very wild manner

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.735 align:middle line:84%
and start dissipating the levels
of adrenaline and cortisol

00:40:33.735 --> 00:40:35.205 align:middle line:84%
that are now amped
in your system.

00:40:35.205 --> 00:40:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.360 align:middle line:90%
That whole chemical cascade.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Those are some immediate
things you can do.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
chronic stress,

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.220 align:middle line:84%
where you keep seeing
that bank balance lower.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:84%
You've gotten let go
of your job and you're

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.830 align:middle line:90%
looking for another job.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.604 align:middle line:90%
I mean, those chronic stressors.

00:40:51.604 --> 00:40:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: The
chronic stressors

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.460 align:middle line:84%
require you changing the
story and the relationship

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.350 align:middle line:90%
around that.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:02.316 align:middle line:84%
So for those chronic--
we would suggest classes,

00:41:02.316 --> 00:41:03.940 align:middle line:84%
taking those introductory
classes where

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.055 align:middle line:84%
we're teaching you that whole
methodical process, where we're

00:41:07.055 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:84%
holding your hand while we walk
you through it so you can start

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:84%
doing that at the
end of every day.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.140 align:middle line:84%
You can start doing that
after you open the bills

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and put them down for
a moment, and create,

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.512 align:middle line:84%
or go into this new
meditative story

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:22.970 align:middle line:84%
so that your reaction
is different.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.420 align:middle line:90%
And then go back to the bills.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the new story could
be this is going to work out,

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.130 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be
fine, this is temporary.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Those types of things?

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yeah.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:33.589 align:middle line:84%
I would say the new story
needs to be plausible to you.

00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Believable.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Believable to you.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.965 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want to go to the
rose colored glasses extreme.

00:41:39.965 --> 00:41:41.580 align:middle line:90%
We want it to be believable.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is temporary
is a great one.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Or this moment will pass
just as it always has.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Something believable.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you fit that
belief into the structure

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of neurosculpting, then
your brain grabs on to it

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.477 align:middle line:90%
and starts to believe it.

00:41:59.477 --> 00:42:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And it can help lower
the stress response

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:03.440 align:middle line:90%
and the chronic stress.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: And
change the pattern.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now there's
a wonderful girl

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.082 align:middle line:84%
that you worked
with who-- Heather.

00:42:09.082 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about Heather.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Heather is amazing.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:15.640 align:middle line:84%
She had an accident
about 11 years ago now.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.820 align:middle line:90%
She was thrown from a horse.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So her last recollection
is grabbing on

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.150 align:middle line:84%
for the last moment
of control, hoping

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:27.070 align:middle line:84%
to control the head of the
horse and not being able to.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And then she ended
up crushing her neck,

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and didn't sever
her spine but had

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.640 align:middle line:84%
a subluxation in the
back of her neck,

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:40.860 align:middle line:84%
ended up a quadriplegic in a
wheelchair, fully assisted.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.860 align:middle line:84%
So she has a team of
people around the clock who

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:84%
have to live with her,
help her out of bed,

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:90%
put her in the wheelchair.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.540 align:middle line:84%
She is a very dynamic
woman and refused

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:90%
to take that as her prognosis.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So she ended up doing a lot
of her own self therapy,

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.450 align:middle line:84%
getting an adaptive yoga
teacher, getting put in a pool,

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:02.600 align:middle line:90%
swimming, going to the gym.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:90%
They move her limbs.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that time, she
gained movement in her arms.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So when I met her last
year, paralyzed in her hands

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and unable to
walk, and she asked

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.060 align:middle line:84%
if I would work with her to help
raise money for her therapy.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me to
speak at an event.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'd
rather work with you.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So I took her on as
a pro bono client.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've been working
together since.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And we've been
using neurosculpting

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.090 align:middle line:84%
to have her enhance
the plasticity

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:40.750 align:middle line:90%
of her motor and sensory cortex.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she creates a
new story in her brain.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: She down
regulates her stress,

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:50.100 align:middle line:84%
activates the front, creates a
new story in the motor cortex,

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.935 align:middle line:84%
specifically in the cortex area
that controls hand movement.

00:43:53.935 --> 00:43:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Does she visualize?

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.005 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: She
visualizes this.

00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Moving.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:56.860 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: And in
that visualization,

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I have her open her
hands in her mind's eye.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.710 align:middle line:90%
I have her name each finger.

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.530 align:middle line:90%
We spell each finger.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.250 align:middle line:84%
We have her give
it a personality,

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.770 align:middle line:90%
abstract colors, textures.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I have her then take that thumb.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:21.850 align:middle line:84%
T-H-U-M-B is her thumb, and I
have her send that imagery down

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:84%
through her body
into her thumbs.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We have her do somatic
repetitious identification.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I then touch her
thumbs and let her

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:33.150 align:middle line:84%
know what it feels like
for external stimulation.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And just this summer she
has volitional movement

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:37.490 align:middle line:90%
in her thumbs.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:39.210 align:middle line:90%
She's opened her index fingers.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:90%
She has the pinch motion.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And just most recently,
she's picked up a rock

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.121 align:middle line:84%
and transferred it
to her other hand.

00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, we get to
see a video of that.

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:51.785 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this video of
Lisa working with Heather.

00:44:51.785 --> 00:44:53.270 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:56.735 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.385 align:middle line:84%
>>HEATER: Like whenever I'm
stressed out and I'm having

00:45:18.385 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:84%
a hard time sleeping, I'll just
start kind of thinking about

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.570 align:middle line:84%
what you tell me to do like
with my fingers and my arms

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:26.234 align:middle line:90%
and like--

00:45:26.234 --> 00:45:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: And you got that.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.125 align:middle line:90%


00:45:31.125 --> 00:45:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Index finger map.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.420 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Identification, location.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:42.565 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge this communication
between brain and index finger.

00:45:42.565 --> 00:45:44.545 align:middle line:84%
>>HEATHER:
Identification, location.

00:45:44.545 --> 00:45:47.875 align:middle line:90%
Acknowledge this commun--

00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Communication.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.041 align:middle line:90%
>>HEATHER: Communication.

00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:54.940 align:middle line:90%


00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Wow.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HEATHER: I was trying
to touch my thumb, but--

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Wow, Heather.

00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:58.848 align:middle line:90%
>>HEATHER: There we go.

00:45:58.848 --> 00:45:59.880 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.805 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Wow.

00:46:00.805 --> 00:46:02.628 align:middle line:90%
>>HEATHER: Look what I did.

00:46:02.628 --> 00:46:03.604 align:middle line:90%
I went like this.

00:46:03.604 --> 00:46:11.922 align:middle line:90%


00:46:11.922 --> 00:46:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a little
heavier in that case.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:23.909 align:middle line:90%


00:46:23.909 --> 00:46:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to
use my fingertips.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's nice that like it's
not-- There's a grip there.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:33.946 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: You
are holding that.

00:46:33.946 --> 00:46:35.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:38.010 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HEATHER: Like my
finger is-- I mean,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.792 align:middle line:84%
you can see the tip
of it moving like I'm

00:46:45.792 --> 00:46:47.125 align:middle line:90%
trying to squeeze them together.

00:46:47.125 --> 00:46:48.654 align:middle line:90%

opened that much.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.996 align:middle line:84%
I've never even gotten
it to open because most

squeeze together, you know.

>>HEATHER: I think
it's a great idea

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.063 align:middle line:84%
that we started at
my hands, because I

00:47:51.063 --> 00:47:55.340 align:middle line:84%
feel like a lot of my tension
has to do with my fingers.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.265 align:middle line:90%
Like it's so weird.

00:47:56.265 --> 00:47:57.295 align:middle line:90%

your refugee program.

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: Well,
I've partnered up

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:38.080 align:middle line:84%
with Her Many Voices,
which is a nonprofit.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And their mission is to respond
to humanitarian needs, whatever

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:90%
they may be.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.736 align:middle line:84%
And we have been wanting to
do this program for a while

00:48:48.736 --> 00:48:49.235 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:48:49.235 --> 00:48:50.240 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So we gathered a
group of refugees,

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.737 align:middle line:84%
women in the community
who were making

00:48:58.737 --> 00:49:00.070 align:middle line:90%
a big difference in their lives.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They had been refugees,
but they weren't

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.050 align:middle line:84%
letting that get in the way,
and they were forging ahead.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.925 align:middle line:84%
And these women were
now enrolled in college.

00:49:05.925 --> 00:49:06.750 align:middle line:90%


00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they volunteered
for this program.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And we took women from Nigeria,
Eritrea, Libya, Ethiopia,

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Somalia, Crow Nation,
and Cherokee Nation.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.860 align:middle line:90%
And we brought them together.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And we started training them
in neurosculpting so that they

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.710 align:middle line:84%
could start regulating
and releasing themselves

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:32.990 align:middle line:84%
from their traumatic
stories so they could go out

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and do their work
bigger in the world.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And we have a series of
trainings set up for them.

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.720 align:middle line:84%
They will become facilitators
over the next eight

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.030 align:middle line:90%
to nine months.

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
women, their mission

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:50.160 align:middle line:84%
is to go back to their
countries and offer a way

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.110 align:middle line:84%
to role model for
their communities

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.900 align:middle line:84%
how to become
grounded and centered,

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and not become victim
to the stories.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.040 align:middle line:90%


00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.772 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they're
learning the process,

00:49:59.772 --> 00:50:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
going to teach it.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: They're
learning the process first

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:03.650 align:middle line:90%
at the Institute.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:05.450 align:middle line:90%
You can't teach theory.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:06.710 align:middle line:90%
We don't do theory.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you have not used it
to unravel yourself and wind

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.770 align:middle line:84%
yourself back up in a better
way, you cannot teach it.

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:18.976 align:middle line:84%
So these women first are
learning the process.

00:50:18.976 --> 00:50:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And they're using it.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have follow
up sessions to make

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:24.680 align:middle line:84%
sure they're using it in
a way that works for them.

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And once they've demonstrated
that they've used it

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.630 align:middle line:84%
on themselves, then
we will train them

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:32.900 align:middle line:84%
on how to teach this
technique to other people.

traumatized me growing up.

00:51:21.346 --> 00:51:23.725 align:middle line:84%
And I think being

allow me to share
that with my community

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.990 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for us to let
go of a lot of things

that we go through
as refugees just

00:51:33.037 --> 00:51:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because we're on that
mode of survival.

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's unfortunate
that a lot of us

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:40.150 align:middle line:84%
don't really realize
the importance of having

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:42.183 align:middle line:84%
a healthy mind and
body and brain.

00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:44.016 align:middle line:84%

00:51:44.016 --> 00:51:46.599 align:middle line:84%
me to relax and just
focus on other things,

an opportunity to get to

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:23.344 align:middle line:84%
and just be sensitive to
where they're coming from

00:52:23.344 --> 00:52:26.810 align:middle line:84%

way to relate to them

00:53:33.461 --> 00:53:34.480 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have such an
amazingly inspirational story.

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so incredible
what you've been through,

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and what you've taught
yourself, and how

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.780 align:middle line:90%
you're teaching other people.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what's the
next step for you?

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:49.570 align:middle line:90%
You're doing so much.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:51.403 align:middle line:84%
How long have you been
doing neurosculpting?

00:53:51.403 --> 00:53:51.902 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.902 --> 00:53:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER:
Neurosculpting since 2007,

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.835 align:middle line:90%
before it had a word.

00:53:55.835 --> 00:53:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I sort of coined
the term in 2011,

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and the Institute
opened in 2012.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But I have been
doing it since 2007.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's as if this
is your mission in life.

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:10.761 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: This is
completely my mission.

00:54:10.761 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't question it anymore.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.490 align:middle line:90%
It just has a life of its own.

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.925 align:middle line:90%
So there are many next steps.

00:54:16.925 --> 00:54:18.430 align:middle line:90%


00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:21.650 align:middle line:84%
My job is to always be
a bridge and a teacher.

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So my next steps involve how
can I enrich the curriculum?

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:28.305 align:middle line:84%
How can I offer more to my
clients and my students?

00:54:28.305 --> 00:54:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.520 align:middle line:84%
How can I get this
out to the world

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:35.710 align:middle line:84%
in ways that make sense,
that invite people in?

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And with that mission,
we are crafting

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.680 align:middle line:84%
neurosculpting
yoga, which will be

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.610 align:middle line:84%
a combination of the mental
entrainment during the yoga

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.580 align:middle line:90%
asanas.

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're working together with
a licensed psychotherapist

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and yoga practitioner
to craft that modality.

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And we will be bringing that
out to the world very soon.

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it'll
be words with yoga.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: It will be the
exact merging of those two.

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So you're guided
through the meditations

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:05.350 align:middle line:84%
during the yoga
poses, and you are

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:07.710 align:middle line:84%
releasing in the
methodical process

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.295 align:middle line:84%
with the bi-hemispheric
activation.

00:55:09.295 --> 00:55:10.380 align:middle line:90%


00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we're bringing that
to the world via yoga.

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:15.060 align:middle line:90%


00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.960 align:middle line:84%
The work with the
refugees will continue.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And then my mission,
of course, is

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.080 align:middle line:84%
to go deeper not only
with police officers,

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.500 align:middle line:90%
but veterans need this.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So the military needs
so much help and support

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:34.350 align:middle line:84%
for what they're asked
to do, what they do do,

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:37.017 align:middle line:84%
and what they are not
prepared to deal with.

00:55:37.017 --> 00:55:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WIMBERGER: So the
mission is to bring

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.180 align:middle line:90%
this in that direction.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're also starting the
talks with a corrections

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:48.980 align:middle line:84%
facility to get a
prison project in place.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:50.485 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
women's shelters?

00:55:50.485 --> 00:55:51.630 align:middle line:90%


00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Absolutely.

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We have a number of
trainers who are survivors

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.930 align:middle line:84%
of deep physical trauma
or domestic violence.

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And together with
the trainers, we're

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.650 align:middle line:84%
looking at where do
we need to take this,

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and how can we get
it out to the world.

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the
trainer will bring it

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:84%
into their individual
environment as they need to.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:14.400 align:middle line:90%
That's very inspiring story.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.307 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
happy to meet you.

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: I am as well.

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for this time.

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I'm sure if I
talk to you in another year

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:26.319 align:middle line:84%
or so, you will have 10
more things under your belt,

00:56:26.319 --> 00:56:28.110 align:middle line:84%
because you're moving
quite fast with this.

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: Yes.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I can
see you're driven.

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:31.400 align:middle line:90%
You're committed.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.910 align:middle line:90%
You have a mission.

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:34.597 align:middle line:90%
And you're also a mom.

00:56:34.597 --> 00:56:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WIMBERGER: And I'm also a mom.

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:37.060 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, my whole mission
after I had my daughter

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.030 align:middle line:84%
was to teach her that all
dreams are attainable.

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:46.035 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:47.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful mission.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you do.

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have taught
people, as well,

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.310 align:middle line:90%
as they watched this video.

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:90%
So thank you again, Lisa.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.760 align:middle line:84%

And until next time, I
invite you to stay inspired.
