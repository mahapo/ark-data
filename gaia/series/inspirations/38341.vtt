So what is the story that
is running your life?

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.324 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that
happened in your childhood

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:28.628 align:middle line:84%
that made you decide whether
or not your good enough,

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.498 align:middle line:84%
smart enough, pretty enough,
strong enough, whatever it is

Welcome.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Gabriel Nossovitch:
Thank you very much.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you have
quite a story.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.329 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness what
a history you have.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.099 align:middle line:84%
So let's start off by
where did you grow up?

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I born
in Argentina in 1964

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.405 align:middle line:84%
in a small town called
Villa Maria

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.808 align:middle line:90%
and in a very unusual family.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:18.744 align:middle line:84%
My father was French,
born in France.

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:90%
His friends were Russian.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.417 align:middle line:84%
My mom was-- her parents
were Italian and so

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:28.988 align:middle line:84%
in my home we spoke all these
languages or people mixed

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.925 align:middle line:84%
up all these languages and it
was very unique and interesting.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.228 align:middle line:84%
And I had realized at a
very early age that I was

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:39.366 align:middle line:84%
in a small town where things
were pretty normal for that town

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.434 align:middle line:90%
and we were so different.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Eclectic.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:42.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Eclectic.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.037 align:middle line:90%
We were very eclectic.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.772 align:middle line:90%
We ate at different times.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yup, so-- and spoke
three different languages.

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:49.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Yes, so my
friends would come and say,

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:50.944 align:middle line:84%
"What-- what's going
to on here?"

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:51.511 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right,

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.446 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: What language is

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.446 align:middle line:84%
that that your grandparents
are speaking?

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:56.283 align:middle line:84%
And why is your father
speaking to them

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.984 align:middle line:84%
in a different language
and stuff like that.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.854 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So-- and sometimes the
conversations would start off

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.422 align:middle line:84%
in one language and
end in another, right?

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What was the res--
what is the reason for something

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
like that 'cause I hear
that a lot as well.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well, you
know, for instance my dad

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:11.298 align:middle line:84%
and his brother were
raised in France.

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:12.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And his
parents spoke Russian to them.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.936 align:middle line:90%
But the boys, you know,

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.405 align:middle line:84%
my dad and his brother they
went to school in France.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:21.875 align:middle line:84%
So between then French
was a more--

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:22.642 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Gabriel:-- common or--

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.512 align:middle line:84%
but then they spoke
Russian to the parents.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: To the parents.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So that's why
when you're speaking with all

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.915 align:middle line:90%
of them, you mix them all up.

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:31.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my gosh how funny.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.286 align:middle line:90%
So what is your main language?

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Spanish.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Spanish.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes, yes.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:36.523 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: OK, because
that's how you were raised?

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.592 align:middle line:84%
And my dad would
speak French to me--

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But you
understand them.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch:-- but my mom
Spanish and so I spoke Spanish

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:45.298 align:middle line:84%
with my brother and so that's
that was our main language.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:48.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: OK, so then you grew
up in Argentina until how long?

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Until
I was 8 years old

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:54.507 align:middle line:84%
and then the political
environment was unsafe

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.575 align:middle line:90%
for us to stay there.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:59.112 align:middle line:84%
My father was successful
in business and--

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.947 align:middle line:90%
and, you know, was starting

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:03.149 align:middle line:84%
to getting threats
and things like that.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: To your life?

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Yes,
being like kidnapped.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.357 align:middle line:84%
And so my father being French
decided it would be a good

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:13.393 align:middle line:84%
opportunity for us to
move to France and--

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.862 align:middle line:84%
and learn more about
the French culture.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Do you remember
those threats at that age?

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I do remember my
parents talking about it, yes.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:24.604 align:middle line:84%
And I remember very clearly
one time we had a discussion

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:28.208 align:middle line:84%
in the car about whether or not
we should make this decision

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:31.211 align:middle line:84%
to move for a few
years until things calm

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.847 align:middle line:84%
down in Argentina
to move to France.

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:35.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And so were you
ever at any point in--

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.317 align:middle line:90%
in fear for your life or--

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: I wasn't.

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:38.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's just, OK.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:39.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: I wasn't.

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:41.354 align:middle line:84%
You know I always
thought that everything--

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Was good.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch:-- was good
and exciting and-- and.

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:47.394 align:middle line:84%
So focus was I'm going
to go see a new country.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:48.728 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make new friends.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.631 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to learn a new
language or get better

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
in French 'cause I
could understand it

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.834 align:middle line:90%
but I couldn't speak it so well.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And so then you
moved to France for awhile?

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: We moved to
Paris, right outside of Paris

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.273 align:middle line:90%
and lived there for awhile.

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.208 align:middle line:90%
Went to school and--

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Around what age?

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:05.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: 9-- 8 or 9, yeah.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And I noticed
that you had shared with me

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
that several times you
were there in France alone

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.319 align:middle line:84%
when your parents
were in Argentina.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well
my mom stayed with us

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.156 align:middle line:84%
but my dad would go back to run
his business in Argentina, yes.

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And are there
times that they both leave?

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: No, no.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: No, OK, so you
weren't there alone.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: We
were too young, yeah.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.931 align:middle line:84%
So I mean from what
I know about you,

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.167 align:middle line:84%
you have such an
adventurous spirit.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And you look at things
as opportunities.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.606 align:middle line:84%
But at what point did you
start to then grow up.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.408 align:middle line:90%
You left that area and?

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I left that
area and when I came back

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:41.414 align:middle line:84%
to Argentina I realized how
lucky I was to be exposed

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.116 align:middle line:84%
to so many different
perspectives

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.085 align:middle line:90%
and a different culture.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:48.922 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that's when
my story started shaping up.

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:53.126 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking that I could
make a contribution illuminating

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:56.162 align:middle line:84%
for people that will have
different perspectives.

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:59.833 align:middle line:84%
And that we do things and
think differently according

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:02.736 align:middle line:84%
to where we were brought up
because I came back to Argentina

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:04.404 align:middle line:84%
and some of the assumptions
that my friends--

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.706 align:middle line:84%
some of the things
that went unquestioned,

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:10.276 align:middle line:84%
having come from France where
I, you know, lived as an 8,

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:12.512 align:middle line:90%
9 year old boy I had noticed

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:14.147 align:middle line:84%
that they were making
some assumptions

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.015 align:middle line:84%
that weren't valid
for me anymore.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:19.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you-- you have
always been in that situation

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.755 align:middle line:84%
where you look at things a
little bit different even the

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
way that you are raised and
the timing of your life,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.025 align:middle line:84%
in the way that you
moved and so forth.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.027 align:middle line:90%
So your life had that chant--

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:32.432 align:middle line:84%
not a challenge but the
experience of going slightly

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.667 align:middle line:84%
against the grain not
fitting into the normal box.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:35.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: All the time.

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:36.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: All the time.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:37.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Always, Yes.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That explains things.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:39.973 align:middle line:90%
So as we're learning more

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.876 align:middle line:84%
about you 'cause you really
have been such a pioneer.

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So then you moved to-- from
Argentina you moved where?

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well
actually from the small town

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.818 align:middle line:84%
in Argentina we actually
had to move--

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:53.853 align:middle line:84%
well we didn't have to but
we moved to Buenos Aires

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.155 align:middle line:90%
because that was the only place

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.424 align:middle line:84%
where I could get an
education in French.

00:05:57.424 --> 00:06:01.961 align:middle line:84%
And the French school system
and the Argentine school system.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:04.431 align:middle line:84%
So we were simultaneously
learning

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.933 align:middle line:84%
in both languages
geography, history,

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.334 align:middle line:90%
math, physics, everything.

00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:09.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness.

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:11.204 align:middle line:84%
And then from there
you went to college,

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.272 align:middle line:90%
you stayed in that area?

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Then
I went to college.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.576 align:middle line:84%
You know, I went back to the
center of Argentina and went

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.445 align:middle line:84%
to college there for
a couple of years.

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:20.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And how did you-- did
you, were you supposed to go

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:21.948 align:middle line:90%
into the family business?

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:23.249 align:middle line:84%
Take over your father's
business?

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:24.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly,
my father wanted me

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
to takeover his business
with my brother.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.456 align:middle line:90%
He had designed our lives.

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:33.793 align:middle line:84%
My brother would be the engineer
and I would be the accountant.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted, you know,
the productions manager

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.631 align:middle line:90%
and the administrative manager.

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:39.766 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK so?

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And so
I-- I didn't like that.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:45.538 align:middle line:90%
It felt like so constraining.

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:46.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I don't see
you as an accountant.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.308 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: No.

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:49.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But most people would
say while my life is set I could

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.045 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and fit right
into that family business.

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:52.745 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:53.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Right.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Not you.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.614 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly.

00:06:54.614 --> 00:06:55.148 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:57.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I felt
like almost choked up

00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:01.387 align:middle line:84%
and so I started
a double career.

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.356 align:middle line:84%
I started studying
political science

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and international relations at
one university and accounting

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.028 align:middle line:84%
at a different university
in parallel.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:10.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Just appease
your father?

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:11.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Just
because I wanted--

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought that it would be
important to get his approval.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.837 align:middle line:84%
And so in my mind I
had to please them

00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:19.205 align:middle line:90%
and still do what I wanted.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm-hmm.

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:23.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: But I was
exhausted because I was going

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.211 align:middle line:84%
to school from early in the
morning until late at night

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:26.913 align:middle line:84%
and then having to
study for both.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:28.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my God.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And it was--
it was a draining and tiring.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So how did that end up?

00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:34.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So I
found at the university

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:37.223 align:middle line:84%
where I was studying political
science I discovered an

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:90%
opportunity to travel to Japan.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.732 align:middle line:84%
They had a scholarship-- a one
year scholarship to go to Tokyo

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:47.967 align:middle line:84%
and study political
science there

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.669 align:middle line:84%
and it was a competitive
scholarship

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:55.475 align:middle line:84%
so I decided I would apply and
study for it and pass the exams.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What's a
competitive scholarship?

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well-- well
you have to compete for it.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:07:59.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Compete for it.

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.047 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And your covered,
you know, you don't have

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:04.617 align:middle line:84%
to pay tuition in
Japan and all that.

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:05.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting, OK.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So and then
they pay for your airfare

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.355 align:middle line:90%
and all of this thing.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So you got that.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So I got
that and so I went to Japan,

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:13.927 align:middle line:90%
lived in Tokyo for a year.

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:15.028 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How old are you now?

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:18.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I think
19 or 18-- yeah, 19.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:18.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: 19.

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:19.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:20.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.367 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:24.237 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I love the whole
culture that you were raised

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:27.807 align:middle line:84%
in because you by now as a
teenager where most teenagers

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:30.443 align:middle line:84%
in America are completely
lost you've been

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.045 align:middle line:90%
to how my countries now we've--

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: France,
Argentina and Japan.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:37.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Oh actually
and the US we skipped the fact

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:40.853 align:middle line:84%
that I came to the US as an
exchange student when I was 14.

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.156 align:middle line:90%
I was the youngest youth

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:46.559 align:middle line:84%
for understanding exchange
student at the time.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.295 align:middle line:90%
They wanted kids to be 15.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you
through an understandings

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.631 align:middle line:90%
of exchange program.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: As an exchange
program where they placed you

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
with an American family and
then you live with them.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.239 align:middle line:84%
And I at 14, I said
I want to go.

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:02.575 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn English
and I want to experience--

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:05.345 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated by
the United States.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:08.748 align:middle line:84%
I had this fascination by
the, you know, this country.

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:11.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What was it
that fascinated you?

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: The influence
that it had in the world.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.756 align:middle line:84%
I mean most of our series
and TV programs and whatnot.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:20.827 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like there
was a conversation--

00:09:20.827 --> 00:09:23.596 align:middle line:84%
strong conversation about
freedom and about rights

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:28.167 align:middle line:84%
and about, you know,
experiencing and experimenting

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.638 align:middle line:84%
and taking perspectives and
democracy working really well

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:33.273 align:middle line:84%
with no corruption
and like that.

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:34.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting, yeah.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.342 align:middle line:84%
So then OK, you wind
up in Japan.

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:38.578 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you
taught English there?

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: I did.

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:44.017 align:middle line:84%
I did, well actually Spanish,
French and English a little bit.

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:45.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:47.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Yes, you know,
the language of instruction

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:50.289 align:middle line:84%
at the university where I
was in Tokyo was English.

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:52.792 align:middle line:84%
So I was getting
better and better.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:56.629 align:middle line:84%
So I, you know, I started
teaching at a language academy.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.931 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then that obviously
wasn't your end goal though?

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: No, no I was
like this is a great way

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to make money and support
myself and have some extra cash.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But in the
meantime you were separating

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.073 align:middle line:90%
from the family even more?

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:09.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You could have gone
actually any further away.

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:11.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly,
that's what I always say.

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:15.381 align:middle line:84%
If you think-- if you go
from Argentina and dig a hole

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
through the center of the
earth, you end up in Japan.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.386 align:middle line:84%
It was like the farthest place
I could go on the planet.

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How did that go
over with your parents?

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: They
were very supportive.

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:26.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: They've always
been very, very supportive, yes.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:30.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But yet you made
a statement advice by doing

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.066 align:middle line:84%
that that you were not going
to be in the family business.

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:35.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I never
actually communicated

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:36.602 align:middle line:90%
in that way directly.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:39.806 align:middle line:84%
I was always in the process
of preparing myself--

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: To communicate that?

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well in their
minds I think I was preparing

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.245 align:middle line:90%
myself to come back.

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:50.183 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of like go
and explore the world,

00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:51.984 align:middle line:84%
gain all the experience
you want,

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:54.153 align:middle line:84%
go to the best schools,
do whatever you want.

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And
then come back.

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:57.724 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Experiment and then
we trust that you will comeback

00:10:57.724 --> 00:10:59.258 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
you want to do.

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So
that didn't happen?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And that
did not happen, no.

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:05.732 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: No, I
found that too limiting.

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:06.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Well it's interesting

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:09.302 align:middle line:84%
for both the parental
perspective

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:11.904 align:middle line:84%
and also your perspective
that those types

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:90%
of things don't always work.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.777 align:middle line:84%
You know the-- the best
laid plans of mine.

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:19.579 align:middle line:90%
But OK so then you came back.

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:24.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I came back to
Argentina and soon realized

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.721 align:middle line:84%
that I really wanted to
continue to explore the world.

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:31.324 align:middle line:84%
Georgetown University
had an exchange program

00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:33.426 align:middle line:90%
with Sophia University in Japan.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:35.628 align:middle line:90%
They are both Jesuits Schools.

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:39.532 align:middle line:84%
And I had met this
great Panamanian girl

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.835 align:middle line:84%
at Sophia University
who was from Georgetown

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.637 align:middle line:84%
and was doing an
exchange program.

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.339 align:middle line:90%
And so she encouraged me to come

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:50.343 align:middle line:84%
to Washington D.C. She said you
must come to D.C. You're going

00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:55.281 align:middle line:84%
to love D.C. And so I applied
to Georgetown from Japan.

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness.

00:11:56.616 --> 00:11:58.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So going to
Argentina was just a little trip

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:01.954 align:middle line:84%
to go visit my parents because I
was soon accepted at Georgetown.

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Wow, and so then you
decided to come to the US.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:06.993 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Come to the US.

00:12:06.993 --> 00:12:08.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And now this, and
we're going to circle back

00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:13.132 align:middle line:84%
around to how did get this-- you
started on the power of story.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:15.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: OK, so I--

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.671 align:middle line:84%
when I was at Georgetown I
did a Lifespring training.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:19.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Lifespring?

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:20.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Lifespring.

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:22.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And that is
a transformational?

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:23.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Transformational.

00:12:23.643 --> 00:12:26.779 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my roommate
from Georgetown invited me

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:30.316 align:middle line:84%
to his graduation of his
advanced course from Lifespring.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:33.786 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into a room
and the lights are dimmed

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:90%
and they seem very--

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Serious.

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:40.226 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Serious
but happy, really,

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.961 align:middle line:90%
really happy at the same time.

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.596 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that my
roommate had lost--

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
his voice was hoarse
and I-- I was intrigue.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.537 align:middle line:84%
They asked us to stand in front
of whoever invited us and then,

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, when they opened
their eyes they give us a hug.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.208 align:middle line:90%
I thought this is strange.

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:56.375 align:middle line:90%
This is like a cult.

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:57.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:57.844 --> 00:12:59.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: What's
going on in here?

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.913 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to the
trainer, curious as I was

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:06.219 align:middle line:84%
and I said I noticed
that Eric lost his voice.

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:08.554 align:middle line:90%
And she looked at me this very--

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:12.291 align:middle line:84%
this woman had a lot
of gravitas, you know.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: She
was like this--

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:15.161 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Very confident.

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:16.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah,

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:19.131 align:middle line:84%
very confident African-American
big-- big, large woman.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:26.439 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "And with his
voice, he lost his arrogance."

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:29.508 align:middle line:84%
And I thought oh,
well I'm hooked.

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:32.144 align:middle line:90%
I want to know more about this.

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.848 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That was like
hey, "I like these people."

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:36.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I
like these people.

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.784 align:middle line:84%
They're straight
shooters, they're direct.

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:40.152 align:middle line:90%
They tell you like they see it.

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And-- and
then they were very--

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:44.824 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed that these
people are very direct

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:48.527 align:middle line:84%
and very confrontive
in a very loving way.

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:51.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Was that not your
experience growing up?

00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:55.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: It was but I'd
also seen a lot of the world

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
where people were
much more, you know,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.772 align:middle line:84%
flowery in their
communication and not so direct.

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:00.973 align:middle line:90%
So I was intrigued.

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:02.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you liked
it, you're hooked

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:05.311 align:middle line:84%
and then you became
a Lifespring Trainer.

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Eventually, yes.

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:07.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Amazing.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.181 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:10.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then did-- is
that where you learned really

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.886 align:middle line:84%
about the power of story in
transformational context?

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:16.222 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah, I'd
realized that we're all,

00:14:16.222 --> 00:14:17.924 align:middle line:84%
you know, interpreting
all the time

00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:21.761 align:middle line:84%
that as human beings we
are constantly looking

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:25.831 align:middle line:84%
at our environment
and making up stories,

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:28.034 align:middle line:90%
interpreting constantly.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.904 align:middle line:84%
And I realized how the
interpretation that we land on

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:38.277 align:middle line:84%
or lands on us really paints
or really shapes the way

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:40.379 align:middle line:84%
that reality ends up
showing up for us.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:43.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So what types of
stories were you running based

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:45.751 align:middle line:84%
on your wonderful
experiences and your travels

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and your parents and
all that we've learned

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.721 align:middle line:84%
about your colorful
background here.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What were you running?

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.057 align:middle line:90%
What did you learn?

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: I-- well I was--

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:54.026 align:middle line:84%
I had noticed that I was running
a story that I was blessed

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:56.028 align:middle line:84%
and special because
my grandmother

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:59.365 align:middle line:84%
as a little boy kept telling me
all the time you're an angel.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:02.535 align:middle line:84%
I took it literally like
I really thought through.

00:15:02.535 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Wings were
going to spread out.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: That
I was going to.

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:08.274 align:middle line:84%
That my mission was to,
you know, spread love

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.743 align:middle line:84%
and help other people because
I was here on a mission

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:11.978 align:middle line:90%
because I was an angel.

00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:13.779 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother would
actually say things like that.

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.181 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:18.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: As I grew up but
I also I think made up the story

00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:22.521 align:middle line:84%
that I was unique in the
sense that, you know,

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
being in that family
that was so different

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.461 align:middle line:84%
from all my friends' families,
being exposed to living

00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.129 align:middle line:90%
in different countries.

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.431 align:middle line:84%
And-- and also I
remember my father saying

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.467 align:middle line:90%
that I was stubborn.

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:37.269 align:middle line:84%
But he attributed a
positive quality to it

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:84%
because he would say you
are so stubborn that sooner

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.275 align:middle line:84%
or later you end up
getting what you want.

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.678 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that
stuck with me that--

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:46.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How do I
get what I want?

00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah,
eventually, I learned that it's

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.483 align:middle line:90%
about persistence but he had--

00:15:50.483 --> 00:15:53.285 align:middle line:84%
initially I had it wired
that it was my stubbornness,

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:56.522 align:middle line:84%
my taking that position and
being like I won't, you know,

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
let go of this until
it happens--

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm-hmm.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: -- that
kind of intentionality.

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So that's
a great example

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.229 align:middle line:90%
of how stories do get through.

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:05.598 align:middle line:84%
I was told I was stubborn
a lot too as a child.

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:07.066 align:middle line:90%
And I've always labeled myself

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.868 align:middle line:84%
as being hard headed
and stubborn.

00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:09.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And-- and
so that was put

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:14.006 align:middle line:84%
but whereas it might
just be the fact that I'd

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:15.541 align:middle line:84%
like to challenge the
truth a little bit.

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:16.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly, me too.

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:17.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:18.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: I know exactly--

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:19.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right?

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:20.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly.

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:21.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So OK so
that's a good example.

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:25.217 align:middle line:84%
So you were carrying that
story of what did you say?

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:28.788 align:middle line:84%
You said different-- a
little bit self confident.

00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:29.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In a way--

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: It-- it generated
some confidence I believe

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:34.326 align:middle line:90%
in myself.

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But anyway did it
not show up in a good way

00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:37.797 align:middle line:84%
in you life as arrogance
or something?

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:40.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: You may--
I never actually thought

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:42.134 align:middle line:90%
of it that way as arrogant.

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:43.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: No.

00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:44.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: But, you know, I
was also running other stories.

00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:49.575 align:middle line:84%
I was the younger of two
boys and in my experience I--

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:52.912 align:middle line:84%
it felt like my father
favored my brother.

00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:53.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:16:53.913 --> 00:16:56.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And
so I-m certain now

00:16:56.614 --> 00:16:58.417 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't a conscious thing

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.986 align:middle line:84%
and it's not even
probably the truth.

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:03.189 align:middle line:84%
It's-- my experience
was that I didn't get

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.524 align:middle line:90%
as much attention as he did.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:09.695 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, I had
stories to validate that.

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:10.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That he was
the favorite child.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Thinking that.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: We actually
have a video here

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:15.901 align:middle line:84%
of Gabriel telling his
story about his brother.

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.268 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:17:17.268 --> 00:17:20.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: When I was 8
years old I remember my dad came

00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to me and asked me what
I wanted for Christmas.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:28.781 align:middle line:84%
So at 8 very practically my
parents had already decided

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:31.784 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, I was too old to
believe in Santa Clause, right?

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:36.155 align:middle line:84%
So-- so what did I want
from them for Christmas.

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:40.192 align:middle line:84%
And I actually said that
I wanted a blackboard

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:43.763 align:middle line:84%
and a chalk and--
'cause I remember

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:46.599 align:middle line:84%
that when people are
playing during breaks

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:51.337 align:middle line:84%
at school I would always
draw circles with Ss

00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:54.406 align:middle line:90%
and arrows and things like that.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.608 align:middle line:90%
And that was play time for me.

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:56.776 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

00:17:56.776 --> 00:17:59.478 align:middle line:84%
And if I could grab
anybody to listen to my--

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:02.281 align:middle line:84%
to whatever I wanted to
show them then I was happy,

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:04.917 align:middle line:90%
and that was my play, right?

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when they were
distributing the presents my

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.157 align:middle line:84%
brother opens his and
it's this amazing,

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
beautiful model airplane for
him to build, but not only that,

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.264 align:middle line:84%
it had a-- he also
got an engine and one

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
of those remote control things
to build into the plane.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.501 align:middle line:90%
He was jumping up and down.

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:26.572 align:middle line:84%
He was so excited and--
and I was like, wow,

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:27.907 align:middle line:84%
this is great he
got what he wanted.

00:18:27.907 --> 00:18:29.341 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited for him.

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:31.944 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, the presents
kept being passed around.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:35.414 align:middle line:90%
And then I got a box like this.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:42.555 align:middle line:84%
And my heart rate sped up and I
opened it and suddenly I opened

00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:45.024 align:middle line:90%
and I found a model airplane.

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:49.361 align:middle line:84%
And it was not, you
know, 250 pieces.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:52.698 align:middle line:84%
It was like a hundred pieces
and I just couldn't help

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:57.036 align:middle line:84%
but I guess show my
disappointment in that moment.

00:18:57.036 --> 00:19:01.774 align:middle line:84%
And my dad quickly said to me,
"Well, you know, you're younger

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:04.376 align:middle line:84%
than your brother so
this one will be easier

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:90%
for you to build."

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.716 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
anybody to know

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:13.052 align:middle line:84%
that because I was
too proud at the time.

00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:15.754 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want them to know
that I was just devastated.

00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:18.657 align:middle line:90%
So I just-- and but a lot

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:21.293 align:middle line:84%
of things were happening
in my head.

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.495 align:middle line:90%
I'm not as smart as my brother.

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not as important
as my brother.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.899 align:middle line:84%
What I want doesn't matter, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.234 align:middle line:90%
So what are all those?

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:29.868 align:middle line:90%
Are we all clear?

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:32.238 align:middle line:84%
They're completely made up
stories because what really,

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:34.573 align:middle line:84%
really, really happened
that day.

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:90%
I got a model airplane to build.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.812 align:middle line:84%
That's what really,
really happened.

00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:40.746 align:middle line:90%
Is it not?

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:42.815 align:middle line:84%
That's all that happened,
really.

00:19:42.815 --> 00:19:45.951 align:middle line:84%
The rest is whatever
I made up, right?

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.921 align:middle line:84%
Stories, a bunch of
stories so, right?

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:52.258 align:middle line:84%
Now this is and I find
this very liberating.

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:55.527 align:middle line:84%
The past has absolutely
no impact.

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.963 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that really
has an impact is what?

00:19:57.963 --> 00:19:59.431 align:middle line:90%
>> The story.

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:05.371 align:middle line:84%
>> The story you're holding
yourself about what happened.

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.906 align:middle line:84%
In fact I find that most human
beings are looking to create

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:14.146 align:middle line:84%
in the future to fix the past
rather than being inspired

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:17.883 align:middle line:84%
about the possibility of being
the conduit for something

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.686 align:middle line:84%
that really wants to
manifest on its own.

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:23.389 align:middle line:84%
It wants to self liberate in
the ever present moment of now.

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:27.126 align:middle line:84%
And all I have to do is create
space for it, all right?

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:29.595 align:middle line:84%
When I create that space, when
I'm present to the stories

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:32.765 align:middle line:84%
and I shut the stories and
I create the space for it.

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:34.266 align:middle line:90%
What wants to happen is good.

00:20:34.266 --> 00:20:35.968 align:middle line:90%
It is true.

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:37.403 align:middle line:90%
It is beautiful.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:40.472 align:middle line:90%
It just wants to happen

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:41.907 align:middle line:84%
and I can just provide
the space for it.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So how did you get

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:47.279 align:middle line:84%
from this wonderful experience
you had of traveling everywhere

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and going through Lifespring
to now teaching about story

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.819 align:middle line:84%
in corporate environments
such as that?

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:56.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well when I
learned and realized the power

00:20:56.889 --> 00:21:01.226 align:middle line:84%
of story and in terms of shaping
our lives how what we decide is

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:05.464 align:middle line:84%
true we end up creating
and generating, you know,

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:09.001 align:middle line:84%
like thoughts become things
like my abilities says, right?

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:12.471 align:middle line:84%
Or the law of attraction,
you know?

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:15.941 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that we are
focused on we get more of.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So if-- if I'm running a story
called I'm not good enough

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:25.351 align:middle line:84%
or if I have a story that I'm
special then it will generate

00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:26.185 align:middle line:90%
different results.

00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:27.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What about?

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:28.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: The story will
actually validate itself.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And so how did
that manifest in your life

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:33.692 align:middle line:84%
where that story of yours
special manifest in your life?

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:36.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well that I
always refuse to be, you know,

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.831 align:middle line:90%
boxed into any kind

00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:40.733 align:middle line:84%
of constrained limiting
environment.

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:43.602 align:middle line:84%
I just felt like no, I'm up
to something bigger than this.

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yet you
were in education.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.672 align:middle line:84%
I mean you went through
college after college.

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:47.339 align:middle line:90%
Those are--

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Pretty boxed
in environments.

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:50.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah,
yeah exactly.

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:84%
SoI got an MBA program
in France.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.584 align:middle line:84%
And-- and it was always
around having to prove myself.

00:21:58.584 --> 00:22:02.654 align:middle line:84%
So I was running an unconscious
story that my value came

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:84%
from other people
approving of me.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.792 align:middle line:90%
So that's a typical one.

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:11.296 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that's a very typical
one of a captain's of industries

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:15.567 align:middle line:84%
and major CEOs that are making
big corporations run, you know?

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:16.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: They are trying
to prove themselves.

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:18.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes, yes.

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:20.205 align:middle line:84%
And then their families
are falling apart

00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:22.941 align:middle line:84%
because in the quest to prove
themselves to be the best,

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:25.778 align:middle line:84%
to be the-- the leader,
to be the, you know,

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:28.781 align:middle line:84%
there are things
are falling off--

00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:31.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Like Employee relations
and not treating them--

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:34.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Like the
relationship with their kids.

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:37.322 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can't tell you
how many CEOs I worked

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:39.358 align:middle line:84%
with that had horrible
relationships.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.927 align:middle line:84%
Their kids were, you know, in
drug rehabilitation centers.

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:43.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right.

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:46.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And because,
you know, they worked so much

00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:50.035 align:middle line:84%
and that's all coming from their
desire to produce, produce,

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.771 align:middle line:84%
produce because that's the
way that these get validated.

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:53.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm-hmm.

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Nosovitch: And
it's all unconscious.

00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:59.044 align:middle line:84%
So the way I got into
corporate training is, you know,

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:84%
through the back door because
I started sharing with people

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.819 align:middle line:84%
that if they knew what story is
running their lives they could

00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:09.188 align:middle line:84%
find out what stories are
blocking their ability

00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:11.957 align:middle line:84%
to generate and produce
extraordinary results.

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:13.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:15.227 align:middle line:84%
So give me an example
of how that showed

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.329 align:middle line:90%
up in-- in someone's life?

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:19.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well like
the example I just gave you

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:23.836 align:middle line:84%
like I started talking to a
CEO and he said, you know,

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:27.206 align:middle line:84%
some of the things that are
not working in my life are

00:23:27.206 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:84%
which is some-- one
of the questions

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.776 align:middle line:84%
that I asked this,
this and that.

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:33.212 align:middle line:84%
My, you know, wife
doesn't trust me anymore.

00:23:33.212 --> 00:23:37.182 align:middle line:84%
My son won't relate to me
and I'm about to, you know,

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:39.918 align:middle line:84%
split the company because
I'm not getting along

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:40.886 align:middle line:90%
with my business partner.

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:44.756 align:middle line:84%
And so-- so then
we start exploring.

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:45.924 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:49.561 align:middle line:84%
What-- what are you
telling yourself right now

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:52.498 align:middle line:84%
for why your son is
not speaking to you.

00:23:52.498 --> 00:23:54.666 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that your
wife doesn't trust you?

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And so by asking those questions
then the story gently comes

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:03.742 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of and
always reveals some incident

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:06.945 align:middle line:84%
that happened prior in life
maybe when they were a child.

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right, right.

00:24:08.046 --> 00:24:09.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Where
that story got created.

00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:12.451 align:middle line:84%
So the way that it happens is
every time that we don't want

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:16.755 align:middle line:84%
to experience an experience
because we find it painful,

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:20.926 align:middle line:84%
instead of liberating
it and experiencing it,

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:22.327 align:middle line:90%
we cover it up with a story.

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:23.729 align:middle line:90%
We explain it to ourselves.

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:25.731 align:middle line:84%
We come up with an
interpretation.

00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:26.431 align:middle line:90%
And then we--

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:27.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Have an excuse.

00:24:27.733 --> 00:24:29.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well-- and as
a way to protect ourselves

00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:34.106 align:middle line:84%
from the pain of-- and
because we don't want to have

00:24:34.106 --> 00:24:35.507 align:middle line:90%
that ever happen again.

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:39.144 align:middle line:84%
So I think that if I understand
what happened and I explained it

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:43.348 align:middle line:84%
to myself I can prevent it
from ever occurring again.

00:24:43.348 --> 00:24:46.118 align:middle line:90%
And it has the opposite effect.

00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:49.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So if someone is in
a crisis or having a meltdown

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:51.823 align:middle line:84%
and having that reoccurring
crisis the same thing over

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.325 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again.

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:54.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: It's a pattern.

00:24:54.693 --> 00:24:55.961 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's a pattern of a
story that's running your life.

00:24:55.961 --> 00:24:57.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes, most--

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:58.897 align:middle line:90%
most of the time I find

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:04.336 align:middle line:84%
that life will send
back an opportunity

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:07.973 align:middle line:84%
to learn a particular lesson
again and again and again.

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:12.911 align:middle line:84%
And if you resist it and the
story is what resists the

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.747 align:middle line:84%
experience then is going to
sent it back again and again.

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:18.083 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we get
into these patterns.

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:21.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So I have a friend
who is almost turning 50

00:25:21.386 --> 00:25:25.123 align:middle line:84%
and cannot seem to
make his business work.

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:26.825 align:middle line:90%
And he was in the toy industry.

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:29.027 align:middle line:84%
And his excuse was
the toy industry

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:32.698 align:middle line:84%
since the recession failed
and so he is a failure.

00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:35.434 align:middle line:84%
And he continues
to sabotage himself

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:37.235 align:middle line:90%
in any new ventures that he has.

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:41.807 align:middle line:84%
Now so it would be true to
say that that's his story.

00:25:41.807 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah, so from
what you said I mean I would

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.812 align:middle line:90%
have to talk to him but what--

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:51.049 align:middle line:84%
what is dominant in that
conversation is the environment

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:53.685 align:middle line:84%
is what determines my
possibility for success.

00:25:53.685 --> 00:25:54.953 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:56.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So I would
explore because if he says

00:25:56.355 --> 00:26:00.258 align:middle line:84%
because of the recession then I
would go and say so what was it

00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:04.396 align:middle line:84%
in your childhood that you
perceived or conditions

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:07.332 align:middle line:84%
that didn't allow
you to succeed.

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:11.603 align:middle line:84%
And so that we take it back
to an earlier time in life

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:15.774 align:middle line:84%
when the story about if the
environment doesn't support it

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:16.942 align:middle line:90%
then I can't succeed.

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:20.746 align:middle line:84%
I'm bound by the
limitations of my conquest.

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:22.014 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh my God,
how do you see that?

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:23.815 align:middle line:84%
So let's say your
life for an example.

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:27.452 align:middle line:84%
So you said that you were trying
to prove or please your father.

00:26:27.452 --> 00:26:28.854 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:30.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How did that show up
in your life with that proving

00:26:30.322 --> 00:26:31.823 align:middle line:90%
and pleasing of the story?

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well I
think that I noticed

00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:34.993 align:middle line:84%
that every time I
did really well

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:84%
in school I had a little
bit more attention.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.166 align:middle line:84%
And so I think in my
mind that I made up OK,

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I have to be extraordinarily
good and successful

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.240 align:middle line:84%
for my father to actually be
there for me and perceive me.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.342 align:middle line:84%
And-- and acknowledge
me and validate me.

00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:51.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And accept you.

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:53.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And accept
me because he had a lot

00:26:53.045 --> 00:26:57.783 align:middle line:84%
of attention for my brother and
in my mind he didn't see me.

00:26:57.783 --> 00:26:59.317 align:middle line:90%
I felt not seen.

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:01.887 align:middle line:84%
But every time I did something
extraordinary then he would

00:27:01.887 --> 00:27:04.823 align:middle line:84%
spend-- he would take the
time to say that was great.

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:07.459 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh, OK,
so this is how it works.

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:12.764 align:middle line:84%
I need to prove myself to be
worthy of the attention and love

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:90%
by being extraordinary.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And now how do you
live your life differently

00:27:17.069 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:90%
without that?

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well
I don't think

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:23.709 align:middle line:84%
that I've shut it completely
but I'm aware of it.

00:27:23.709 --> 00:27:25.177 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
first step is always

00:27:25.177 --> 00:27:26.445 align:middle line:90%
to become aware of the story.

00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:29.581 align:middle line:84%
I still find myself all
the time thinking, oh.

00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I wanted, you know, I
people are now going

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.252 align:middle line:84%
to love me unless
I do really well.

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:38.657 align:middle line:84%
And it's, you know, the more, I
think the more evidence you end

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:43.061 align:middle line:84%
up creating and generating
that destroys the story

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:46.364 align:middle line:84%
or contradicts the story then
the story can be let go off

00:27:46.364 --> 00:27:47.766 align:middle line:90%
more easily.

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:49.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I wonder I mean can you
ever really truly live your life

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:54.106 align:middle line:84%
without your story because
if you do there's no context

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:56.108 align:middle line:90%
in your life of how else to be.

00:27:56.108 --> 00:27:57.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:27:57.476 --> 00:28:00.512 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So how would you live
your life without that story

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:02.914 align:middle line:84%
of having to prove
yourself to any one?

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:05.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well I think that
you can re-contextualize it.

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:06.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:09.421 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And what I-- what
I've been working on is to--

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.723 align:middle line:90%
I've been working on exposing

00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:17.195 align:middle line:84%
for people this endless
proving the process.

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:21.733 align:middle line:84%
And that they can actually look
at life as an opportunity to be

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:90%
in service for a higher purpose

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.673 align:middle line:84%
than to be validated
in who they are.

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:30.442 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a-- it's maturity--

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:33.478 align:middle line:84%
it's maturity process--
maturing process.

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:36.548 align:middle line:84%
You either-- you're either
playing the game of life

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:40.852 align:middle line:84%
to prove yourself which is to
want to validate your existence

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:44.322 align:middle line:84%
or you can be in
life playing to serve

00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:47.726 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately generates
tremendous fulfillment.

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:50.128 align:middle line:84%
And in that case you
are not really looking

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.329 align:middle line:90%
to prove yourself.

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:53.598 align:middle line:84%
You're looking for
opportunities to be in service.

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:55.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And both I mean that--

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.936 align:middle line:84%
the latter is probably
more successful

00:28:57.936 --> 00:28:59.371 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
burn your body up.

00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:00.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly, exactly.

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:01.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: For which
you see a lot.

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:02.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So let's
take for example

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:06.311 align:middle line:84%
if you're triggered
by somebody else.

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:10.348 align:middle line:84%
So you're-- somebody
does something

00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:12.184 align:middle line:90%
that pushes your buttons.

00:29:12.184 --> 00:29:14.553 align:middle line:90%
Is that you running your story?

00:29:14.553 --> 00:29:16.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well I
would say because I noticed

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:19.224 align:middle line:84%
that I am triggered by
my children, you know,

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:84%
as a father all this
stuff that is unresolved

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.761 align:middle line:90%
for me leads up t to be.

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:23.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh yeah, comes up.

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:24.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: All of
the stuff comes up.

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.431 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So all that
it tells me-- so if I--

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:31.002 align:middle line:84%
if I allow myself to fall
in love with the process

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:33.705 align:middle line:84%
of releasing stories
then I have no issue.

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.507 align:middle line:90%
When I'm reacting, I realize,

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:37.742 align:middle line:84%
oh that must be an
incompletion for me.

00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:40.312 align:middle line:84%
And it is something that is
not complete as an experience.

00:29:40.312 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: All parents should
walk around with a recorder

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.951 align:middle line:84%
and record themselves when their
kids are young ad then listen

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.385 align:middle line:90%
back and you will hear parents.

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:48.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: It is horrifying.

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:49.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It is.

00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:50.422 align:middle line:90%
No matter what.

00:29:50.422 --> 00:29:52.023 align:middle line:84%
I did that once and I said
something to my daughter

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:53.692 align:middle line:90%
and it echoed off a wall and I'm

00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:55.293 align:middle line:84%
like oh my God, that
was my mother.

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:57.929 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you can
hear it and you just go,

00:29:57.929 --> 00:29:59.297 align:middle line:90%
"I didn't get rid of that."

00:29:59.297 --> 00:29:59.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:02.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: In fact I have
a short story to tell you

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:04.069 align:middle line:84%
about a particular
story that I was

00:30:04.069 --> 00:30:05.871 align:middle line:90%
out validating through my son.

00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:84%
He came home and said nobody
loves me, nobody loves me.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.909 align:middle line:84%
He was kicked out
a friend's house.

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:12.577 align:middle line:84%
And I said of course
people love you.

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:13.979 align:middle line:90%
Of course they love you.

00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:16.248 align:middle line:84%
And he got really upset
and locked himself

00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:19.451 align:middle line:84%
in the walking closet
in his bedroom.

00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:22.053 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Matthew,
get out what's going on?"

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:23.788 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Go away, go away."

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:26.258 align:middle line:84%
So I called our friends
Susan Stiffelman.

00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: OK, parenting
expert, yes.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Parenting expert
who's a good friend of mine.

00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:90%
I said, "What am I doing wrong?"

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.166 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "Gabriel,

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:38.837 align:middle line:84%
why would you be denying
him his experience?"

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:41.907 align:middle line:84%
I was telling him of
course people love you.

00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:44.509 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "It's
all a projection.

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:46.778 align:middle line:90%
It's your stuff."

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:48.880 align:middle line:84%
You know you felt not seeing
you are now generating

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.449 align:middle line:90%
that he has not felt-- he feels

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:53.485 align:middle line:84%
like you're not seeing
what he's going through.

00:30:53.485 --> 00:30:55.287 align:middle line:90%
And so what do I do?

00:30:55.287 --> 00:30:56.488 align:middle line:90%
And she coached me beautifully.

00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:59.991 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Go and say to
him, Matthew, it must feel

00:30:59.991 --> 00:31:04.729 align:middle line:84%
so horrible to experience or
to feel like nobody loves you"

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:07.032 align:middle line:84%
which is completely
validating his experience

00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:08.133 align:middle line:90%
without agreeing with it.

00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:09.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, right,
right and then but?

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:11.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And
then he opened the door

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:13.138 align:middle line:84%
and threw himself into my
arms and he said, "Yes."

00:31:13.138 --> 00:31:16.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then he realized
of course he is loved.

00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:17.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: And then

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:20.545 align:middle line:84%
in a second later he
goes but I am loved.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:23.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yes, that's true
if you say it that way.

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:24.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: In
the beautiful--

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:26.184 align:middle line:90%
you know, and then I realized,

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:31.589 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness I am myself
validating my story--

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Through--

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Putting
it on to him,

00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:35.527 align:middle line:84%
wanting to make it
right for him.

00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:37.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So if somebody
gets triggered.

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:38.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:39.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: By something
someone else's doing

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:90%
that isn't usually them.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: No.

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:43.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's always you.

00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:44.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:31:44.703 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean the reaction
is yours, 100 percent.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.142 align:middle line:84%
So one of the teachings
that in our trainings,

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:54.512 align:middle line:84%
will say life is a series of
completely neutral events.

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, interesting.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: And you bring

00:31:56.815 --> 00:31:59.017 align:middle line:84%
in your interpretation
to the event.

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Now your reaction to
the event is the result

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.656 align:middle line:84%
of whatever stories
you're running

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:07.559 align:middle line:84%
but the event itself
is completely neutral.

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:09.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But what if you're
doing-- what if somebody,

00:32:09.561 --> 00:32:12.964 align:middle line:84%
you know, robbed you or
somebody did something wrong?

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:13.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:16.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You form a
story around that?

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well you're
going to have a reaction, right?

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:20.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And it's--
you're going to be triggered.

00:32:20.572 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And its, you
know, your-- because suddenly,

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:26.778 align:middle line:84%
you know, someone violated
you and took something away

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:29.447 align:middle line:84%
from you, you will have a
completely different result

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:33.151 align:middle line:84%
if you're operating out
of complete reactivity

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:35.453 align:middle line:90%
or reaction then you would

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:38.289 align:middle line:84%
if you just went OK,
so what happened.

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.392 align:middle line:84%
What were the choices
that I made

00:32:40.392 --> 00:32:41.559 align:middle line:90%
that brought me to this point.

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:42.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:43.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: What
is the opportunity

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:44.462 align:middle line:90%
that this provides for me?

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.698 align:middle line:84%
How can I move from
here into the future?

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:49.868 align:middle line:90%
How can I let this not run me?

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:52.303 align:middle line:84%
'Cause every time we react to
something we're at the effect

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:55.407 align:middle line:84%
of we'd lose control
or the effect of--

00:32:55.407 --> 00:32:56.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Our reactions, yeah.

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:57.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Our
reactions, yeah.

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:58.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you're
really talking

00:32:58.276 --> 00:32:59.944 align:middle line:84%
about taking personal
responsibility

00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:03.815 align:middle line:84%
and personal examination on
the events that occurring?

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:04.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:05.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Almost in neutrality.

00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:06.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: In
neutrality, yes.

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:07.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah, that's, that--

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:08.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And
it's beautiful

00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:84%
because the more you can
be grounded in that way

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.994 align:middle line:84%
and not interpret the
things are bad or wrong

00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:19.164 align:middle line:84%
or the less resistance you
bring to your experience

00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:21.933 align:middle line:84%
of life the more
surrendere your are.

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:25.136 align:middle line:84%
The more you participate fully
with whatever life offers,

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:27.639 align:middle line:84%
the greater your
ability to impact the way

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:29.207 align:middle line:90%
that life shows up for you.

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So as we start to
shed our stories we get more

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:32.410 align:middle line:90%
and more expenses.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes, absolutely.

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:35.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This next
clip shows that.

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:37.215 align:middle line:84%
This is an interview
that Gabriel did.

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.016 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:40.552 align:middle line:90%
Listen to what he's saying.

00:33:40.552 --> 00:33:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And living
into a new set of choices

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.289 align:middle line:90%
and then a news story.

00:33:44.289 --> 00:33:47.759 align:middle line:90%
For me it has evolved over time.

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:53.164 align:middle line:84%
Initially it felt like in
order to be able to navigate

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:58.303 align:middle line:84%
in this world of stories and not
being held back by the stories.

00:33:58.303 --> 00:34:00.805 align:middle line:84%
There was a question
that was always important

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to ask ourselves
which was, you know,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.409 align:middle line:90%
what is that I really want?

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:05.810 align:middle line:90%
What's my intent?

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.179 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day so
that I'm not reaction,

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.947 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually creating
something rather

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:12.684 align:middle line:90%
than reacting to something.

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:17.621 align:middle line:84%
Over time now it's evolved to,
you know, allowing the vision

00:34:17.621 --> 00:34:21.693 align:middle line:84%
to manifest itself through
the space that one provides.

00:34:21.693 --> 00:34:24.896 align:middle line:84%
But that's, you know, that
was years later whereas now--

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:27.532 align:middle line:84%
it's not so much
about, you know, forcing

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:31.603 align:middle line:84%
or willing something to be so
in the future but it's more

00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:84%
about precisely allowing
whatever wants--

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.476 align:middle line:84%
whatever wants to be released,
to be released for, you know,

00:34:39.476 --> 00:34:41.779 align:middle line:84%
and then watching what
happens afterward.

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:43.313 align:middle line:90%
>> And you don't hurt anybody.

00:34:43.313 --> 00:34:44.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Beautiful, yes,

00:34:44.581 --> 00:34:48.286 align:middle line:84%
because that's ultimately
ideally your just allow--

00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:50.989 align:middle line:84%
you allow yourself to have the
fullness of the experience.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:54.224 align:middle line:84%
And what appears to happen is
once you have fully experienced

00:34:54.224 --> 00:34:55.994 align:middle line:90%
your experience it disappears.

00:34:55.994 --> 00:34:59.931 align:middle line:90%
And then there is a spaciousness

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:04.836 align:middle line:84%
where the more spacious you
are the more something wants

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:07.005 align:middle line:90%
to land on you.

00:35:07.005 --> 00:35:08.406 align:middle line:90%
There's a vision.

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:13.478 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly moved deeply
by, you know, doing some good

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:17.348 align:middle line:84%
or some, you know, revealing
some truth or something

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:21.286 align:middle line:84%
that almost chooses you so it
can express itself through you.

00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:24.222 align:middle line:84%
So, the more we facilitate
the completion

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:25.957 align:middle line:84%
of whatever experience,
whatever wants

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:29.394 align:middle line:84%
to happen the more
space we have.

00:35:29.394 --> 00:35:31.829 align:middle line:84%
You know I have that experience
around certain people.

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.965 align:middle line:84%
I go-- I feel how
spacious they are

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.867 align:middle line:84%
because they have
room other people

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:36.801 align:middle line:90%
to be aware what they are.

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:37.502 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:38.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Right.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:39.537 align:middle line:90%
And so, the more space we have

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:43.341 align:middle line:84%
and the more space we have
it appears as we expand.

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:46.844 align:middle line:84%
The more spacious we become
then suddenly, the boundaries

00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:51.115 align:middle line:84%
of this thinking that we are
this encapsulated ego, you know,

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:52.984 align:middle line:90%
this, you know, bag of flesh--

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Skin bag.

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:56.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch:-- Skin bag
just sort of dissolves.

00:35:56.821 --> 00:36:00.858 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
experiencing yourself as that

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:02.660 align:middle line:90%
and that, and that and that.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's one--
one of the serendipity

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.299 align:middle line:84%
and all these beautiful
display starts becoming--

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:12.203 align:middle line:84%
you become it, it becomes you,
vice versa and then it's--

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:17.842 align:middle line:84%
it's just-- there's nothing
to-- nothing is to be wield.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So, say for example

00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:24.449 align:middle line:84%
that someone has a financial set
point or even a weight set point

00:36:24.449 --> 00:36:28.052 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to
get over that set point.

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.554 align:middle line:90%
Is that your story?

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:31.122 align:middle line:90%
I mean could you self examine

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:33.791 align:middle line:84%
and say my story is running
my financial set point?

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:34.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Absolutely.

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:35.526 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:36.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Really.

00:36:36.728 --> 00:36:37.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: You know
the fundamental premise is

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:40.265 align:middle line:84%
that whatever we've
decided about life,

00:36:40.265 --> 00:36:42.867 align:middle line:84%
whatever interpretation
was made up we're going

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:46.304 align:middle line:84%
to actively be creating
evidence that it's true.

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:47.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's our job.

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:49.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Our
job is actually,

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:56.214 align:middle line:84%
the stories have this
self validating inertia?

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:57.215 align:middle line:90%
You know if you think that--

00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:58.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: We have to be right.

00:36:58.249 --> 00:36:59.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: We--
I have to be right

00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:01.252 align:middle line:84%
about whatever story
I've made up.

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:04.122 align:middle line:84%
So, I could've made up
the story that, you know,

00:37:04.122 --> 00:37:06.824 align:middle line:84%
are family doesn't
do things this way

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:09.927 align:middle line:84%
or our family is
poor as a child--

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:10.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:37:10.929 --> 00:37:11.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch:--
because when I wanted

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:15.166 align:middle line:84%
to get the brand new
shoes my said to me

00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:17.168 align:middle line:90%
"Our family can't afford it."

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:20.471 align:middle line:84%
So now, that's now
part of my identity.

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:23.775 align:middle line:84%
I can't afford it as part of
my way of being in the world.

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:25.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I see.

00:37:25.143 --> 00:37:27.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And then, it
sets the financial set point.

00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:31.215 align:middle line:84%
I mean can't become wealthy
because I would not belong

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.551 align:middle line:84%
to this family anymore
unconsciously.

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:36.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, how do
you get rid of that?

00:37:36.321 --> 00:37:37.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well,
first the awareness

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:39.290 align:middle line:90%
that it's just a story.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.327 align:middle line:84%
And then, the release
process often comes--

00:37:42.327 --> 00:37:44.962 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's different
techniques, different ways

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:46.564 align:middle line:84%
but the awareness
is fundamental.

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%
First, you have to be
completely aware of the fact

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.768 align:middle line:90%
that it's a made up story.

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:55.306 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, you have to generate
evidence to the contrary

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:56.974 align:middle line:84%
of whatever story
you're running.

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:58.042 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:58.042 --> 00:38:00.211 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Say take
finances for example.

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:05.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So with finances
do something that is outside

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:07.885 align:middle line:84%
of your comfort zone
that will generate--

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:10.521 align:middle line:84%
take a risk that would
generate financial success.

00:38:10.521 --> 00:38:11.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:12.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Even
if it's temporarily.

00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:14.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:38:14.192 --> 00:38:16.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: To break the
evidence that you already have

00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:19.297 align:middle line:84%
that this is not
possible for you.

00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And see what comes up.

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:23.134 align:middle line:84%
So like go and invest
in one stock.

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And get out of the
stock really quick

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:26.804 align:middle line:90%
and make yourself some money--

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:27.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Some money.

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:28.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa:-- and see what happens.

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: That's
a tiny little step

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.775 align:middle line:90%
that you can take, right?

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:31.809 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:32.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: But
also, something else

00:38:32.844 --> 00:38:34.712 align:middle line:84%
that you can do is
to go and have heart

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:36.881 align:middle line:84%
to heart conversations
with people

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:40.151 align:middle line:84%
that you have been
actively using to validate

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.419 align:middle line:90%
that particular story.

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:45.757 align:middle line:84%
That's so powerful, very
powerful way of undoing stories.

00:38:45.757 --> 00:38:50.061 align:middle line:84%
So I have a story that in our
family we're not going to be,

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:53.264 align:middle line:84%
you know, financially
successful then it's OK for me

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:84%
to have a heart to heart
conversation with my father

00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:00.438 align:middle line:84%
and release whatever
interpretation through,

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.407 align:middle line:84%
you know, opening up
a new possibility.

00:39:02.407 --> 00:39:05.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: In, you know, in
past decades the common story

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:10.214 align:middle line:84%
in the household was not to talk
about money in around 50s, 60s.

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:12.216 align:middle line:84%
And that was not
the conversation

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.751 align:middle line:90%
around the dinner table.

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:18.523 align:middle line:84%
And so, what you're saying now
is to go back to your parents

00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:20.491 align:middle line:90%
if they're still alive and say

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:22.794 align:middle line:84%
"You know can we
have a conversation

00:39:22.794 --> 00:39:24.862 align:middle line:84%
about finances when
I was young?"

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:25.963 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:26.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you're
saying to go do that.

00:39:26.998 --> 00:39:28.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: To every--

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:30.134 align:middle line:84%
you look around and
look at everybody

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:32.203 align:middle line:90%
that you have consciously

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:36.374 align:middle line:84%
or unconsciously rather been
playing out the story with.

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:39.477 align:middle line:84%
So, if you-- when your son,
your own son came to you

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:42.447 align:middle line:84%
and said "Hey, can we go
on vacation this year?

00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:44.615 align:middle line:84%
I'd love or I'd love
to go to Disneyland."

00:39:44.615 --> 00:39:47.418 align:middle line:84%
And you say "Well, you
know, we can't afford it."

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:49.654 align:middle line:84%
Then you need to go and have
a heart to heart conversation

00:39:49.654 --> 00:39:54.092 align:middle line:84%
with your son and reveal that
you've been running a story.

00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:55.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's even better.

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:58.229 align:middle line:84%
Wow. So once you catch
your story it shows

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.330 align:middle line:90%
up everywhere in your life.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Everywhere
in your life.

00:40:00.298 --> 00:40:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the more
people you tell

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.469 align:middle line:90%
that you're running a story--

00:40:04.469 --> 00:40:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yup.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch:-- the less
the story has a grip on you

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:11.476 align:middle line:84%
because then your son will
hold you accountable to know

00:40:11.476 --> 00:40:13.411 align:middle line:90%
that or mom that is not--

00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:14.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh yeah.

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch:-- that is not
true that we can afford it.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.416 align:middle line:84%
And if, you know,
if it really matters

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:19.951 align:middle line:84%
to us we'll make it
happen no matter what.

00:40:19.951 --> 00:40:22.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Let me ask you about
a story that you told a ship.

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:25.656 align:middle line:84%
And you gave an analogy of
being the-- a ship in your life.

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:26.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:27.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Can you tell
us a little bit of that?

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah sure.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.863 align:middle line:84%
I always talk about, you know,
imagine that you're on a ship

00:40:31.863 --> 00:40:34.098 align:middle line:84%
because people come
and say I don't want

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.500 align:middle line:90%
to this or that anymore.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.469 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have a financial
set point or I don't want

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:40.638 align:middle line:84%
to smoke anymore or I
want to lose weight.

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:45.042 align:middle line:84%
And all their goals are
based on resisting something

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:47.278 align:middle line:84%
from their past because
if you say

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:48.379 align:middle line:90%
"I don't want to smoke anymore."

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.981 align:middle line:84%
I would ask you "Are
you smoking right now?"

00:40:49.981 --> 00:40:51.749 align:middle line:84%
"No." Then don't,
don't smoke anymore.

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Right?

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:54.852 align:middle line:84%
But where's the evidence
that you smoke?

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:56.988 align:middle line:84%
Well even if you smoke
five minutes ago,

00:40:56.988 --> 00:40:58.523 align:middle line:90%
the evidence is in the past.

00:40:58.523 --> 00:40:59.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Five minutes ago.

00:40:59.023 --> 00:40:59.657 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:00.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: So,

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:01.859 align:middle line:84%
you're looking backwards
instead of forward.

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:04.962 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy of
the boat is behind--

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:08.599 align:middle line:84%
on the wake of the boat-- the
back of the boat is the past.

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.501 align:middle line:84%
The front of the
boat is the future.

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:13.971 align:middle line:84%
When you are declaring
what you want based

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:16.774 align:middle line:84%
on what you don't want, you're
in the back of the boat.

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.576 align:middle line:90%
Who's guiding the boat?

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:19.143 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:19.577 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Nobody.

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:20.912 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:20.912 --> 00:41:22.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So, I Invite
people to stand in the front

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:26.484 align:middle line:84%
of the boat and make a
declaration for what could be

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:31.522 align:middle line:84%
in the face of no evidence
rather than being bound by,

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:33.524 align:middle line:84%
you know, the stuff that
they're in resistance

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:34.959 align:middle line:90%
to which comes from their past.

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:36.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I heard
a statistic ones,

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:39.797 align:middle line:84%
it was an anti smoking
statistic that a high percentage

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:43.401 align:middle line:84%
of the people who smoke had
an influence an early age

00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:45.369 align:middle line:84%
of somebody in their
life that smoked

00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:48.239 align:middle line:84%
that they either
watch or admired.

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.942 align:middle line:84%
So, if it was aunt or if
it was a family friend,

00:41:50.942 --> 00:41:51.742 align:middle line:90%
if it was parent--

00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Interesting.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:53.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:41:53.311 --> 00:41:55.179 align:middle line:84%
So, they are repeating
that pattern.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:56.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Right.

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:59.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, what they could
do is go back into that path,

00:41:59.317 --> 00:42:03.187 align:middle line:84%
find where that story might have
existed, who that person was

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.956 align:middle line:90%
and change the present.

00:42:04.956 --> 00:42:06.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:07.758 align:middle line:84%
And realize that they've made
an assumption or a connection.

00:42:07.758 --> 00:42:10.728 align:middle line:84%
So, they identified success or
identified whatever qualities

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:14.465 align:middle line:84%
that person had with
smoking and undo that because

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:15.866 align:middle line:90%
if your interpretation--

00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:17.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's how it works.

00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:18.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: But most
importantly I would invite them

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to stand in front of the
boat and look to the future.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.978 align:middle line:84%
And instead of wanting to
not smoke to want health

00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:29.614 align:middle line:84%
and vitality and healthy
lungs and clean lungs--

00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:30.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: More.

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:31.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch:--
and to be able to--

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:33.050 align:middle line:84%
so, if you look in the
future you want to be able

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.886 align:middle line:84%
to play soccer with your
child or be able to you know--

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:36.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Run a 5K.

00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:37.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch:-- run a 5K.

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:40.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Then, that's
your focus is running a 5K

00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:42.893 align:middle line:84%
or you know, playing
soccer with your sons

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:43.861 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:45.262 align:middle line:90%
That will cut.

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:48.266 align:middle line:84%
Then you realize while you're
focused on making that happen

00:42:48.266 --> 00:42:50.968 align:middle line:84%
that having a cigarette
is not in alignment

00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:52.670 align:middle line:90%
with who you declare--

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.505 align:middle line:84%
the future that you
declare that you want.

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:55.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So you can
stop addictions

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:57.041 align:middle line:90%
by realizing your stories.

00:42:57.041 --> 00:43:00.044 align:middle line:84%
So, your story runs
everything, stories.

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:01.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Right.

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:03.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And once you find out
one or two of the major themes

00:43:03.481 --> 00:43:07.251 align:middle line:84%
of stories in your life there's
a lot of others but you start

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.152 align:middle line:90%
with there's one or two--

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:09.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:43:09.453 --> 00:43:10.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa:-- and you start to
see where they're showing

00:43:10.488 --> 00:43:11.856 align:middle line:84%
up in your life and
chip away, add it,

00:43:11.856 --> 00:43:13.024 align:middle line:90%
one thing at a time, right?

00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:14.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly, exactly.

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:15.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: There's a great
quote that you have--

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:20.297 align:middle line:84%
that you talked about turning
complaints into opportunities.

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:23.334 align:middle line:84%
And this is a quote that
we have up here on screen

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:27.138 align:middle line:84%
of really taking all of the
opportunities that you have.

00:43:27.138 --> 00:43:29.306 align:middle line:84%
I mean all the complaints
that you have in your life

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:31.275 align:middle line:84%
and these are kind of
what your stories show up.

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:33.411 align:middle line:84%
And turn them into
opportunities.

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:34.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:36.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, what's an example
of a complaint that someone has

00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:39.150 align:middle line:84%
that they were turned
into an opportunity.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:43.587 align:middle line:84%
I mean we just use
smoking for an example.

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:45.356 align:middle line:90%
Money is a good example too.

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:47.158 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough
money to do something.

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:48.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Right.

00:43:48.526 --> 00:43:50.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So how would that get
turned into an opportunity?

00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:50.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Well--

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:51.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Oh wait,
I have good one.

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:52.763 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:53.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: It's okay.

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:55.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- that I like to do.

00:43:55.166 --> 00:43:57.868 align:middle line:84%
Because I hear a lot of people
that call me in my radio show

00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:01.339 align:middle line:84%
about coworkers complaining
about coworkers

00:44:01.339 --> 00:44:02.773 align:middle line:84%
because they're put
into situation

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:04.508 align:middle line:84%
with people they don't
necessarily choose.

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:08.346 align:middle line:84%
And they don't get along with
because the boss hired them

00:44:08.346 --> 00:44:09.547 align:middle line:90%
or the company hired them.

00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:11.382 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're
in the situation

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:13.250 align:middle line:84%
where there's supposed-- all be
working towards the common goal

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.752 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
anything in common

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.687 align:middle line:84%
with the people they're
working with.

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:18.422 align:middle line:84%
How would they take
that complaint

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:19.824 align:middle line:90%
and turn it into an opportunity?

00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:20.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So
they're saying--

00:44:20.925 --> 00:44:22.026 align:middle line:84%
their complaint is "I
don't have anything

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:23.060 align:middle line:90%
in common with these people.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.729 align:middle line:90%
I'm not comfortable with them.

00:44:24.729 --> 00:44:28.532 align:middle line:84%
And I can't coordinate
or make anything happen."

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:29.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:30.301 align:middle line:90%
I can't work with them.

00:44:30.301 --> 00:44:31.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So,
it becomes an excuse.

00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:32.236 align:middle line:90%
I can't work with them.

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:33.571 align:middle line:90%
I'm not comfortable.

00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:37.208 align:middle line:84%
I'm com-- so, look
at the opportunity.

00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:41.679 align:middle line:84%
So, become aware of the fact
that this is a complaint

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:45.349 align:middle line:84%
and complaints, you know,
drain and take energy out.

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:46.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: And look at-- OK.

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:50.187 align:middle line:84%
Now that I realize this is a
complaint, what is the gift

00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:52.890 align:middle line:84%
of this diversity
with this group?

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.825 align:middle line:84%
Start asking different
questions.

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.261 align:middle line:84%
So, what is it going
to call forth?

00:44:57.261 --> 00:45:00.131 align:middle line:84%
What is it going
to require of me

00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:04.668 align:middle line:84%
to be presented this challenge
right now that will allow me

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:07.838 align:middle line:84%
to have a larger
sense of who I am.

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:12.743 align:middle line:84%
So, if I need to develop my
skills to create cooperation

00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:15.579 align:middle line:84%
with people who are very
different then I would never

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:18.282 align:middle line:84%
have the opportunity to realize
that I have that ability,

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:21.051 align:middle line:84%
that skill, unless
I was in a situation

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.754 align:middle line:84%
where people don't
seem to be relating

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:25.055 align:middle line:90%
to one another, makes sense.

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:28.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So look for the
gift in that other person?

00:45:28.359 --> 00:45:29.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:45:29.627 --> 00:45:32.997 align:middle line:84%
Actually, look for what is
it-- calling forth in you?

00:45:32.997 --> 00:45:34.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In you, right.

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:38.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: That you haven't
yet manifested, that you--

00:45:38.536 --> 00:45:42.940 align:middle line:84%
it provide-- it's the raw
material for you to realize

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.277 align:middle line:84%
that you're bigger than whatever
it is that you think you are.

00:45:46.277 --> 00:45:48.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's a good point,
that you're bigger than that.

00:45:48.179 --> 00:45:49.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: That
you're bigger.

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:51.715 align:middle line:90%
So, it-- there are qualities

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:56.187 align:middle line:84%
that if you are complaining
will never be able to--

00:45:56.187 --> 00:45:57.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Manifest, yeah.

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:58.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: --
manifest within you.

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:00.958 align:middle line:84%
And you won't have the
opportunity to have the taste

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:04.094 align:middle line:84%
of who you are as someone
who has those qualities.

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:08.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So somebody is trying
to stand you up at work or show

00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:10.401 align:middle line:84%
that they can do a
better job and you are,

00:46:10.401 --> 00:46:11.535 align:middle line:90%
in competition with you.

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:12.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You want to
look at yourself and say,

00:46:14.038 --> 00:46:18.309 align:middle line:84%
"Where might I-be lazy, where
my I be cutting corners."

00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:20.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well, I'm--
that's a possibility,

00:46:20.811 --> 00:46:23.214 align:middle line:84%
but another possibility
would be, so, who am--

00:46:23.214 --> 00:46:26.984 align:middle line:84%
how am I showing up for
this person as a threat

00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:29.987 align:middle line:84%
that they feel like
they have to out do me?

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:33.057 align:middle line:84%
Or what are the qualities
that I'm not bringing

00:46:33.057 --> 00:46:36.227 align:middle line:84%
into this relationship that
would allow this person to relax

00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:39.296 align:middle line:84%
around me rather than
want to compete with me?

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:40.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:46:40.498 --> 00:46:41.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: What are
some of the ways of being

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:43.234 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not really showing

00:46:43.234 --> 00:46:46.871 align:middle line:84%
that generate this
situation right now, right?

00:46:46.871 --> 00:46:49.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So is this what
you teach when you have--

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.642 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned transformational
companies

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:90%
in several different countries.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You, what do you
do in those companies?

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.147 align:middle line:90%
Are they training companies?

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:57.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:46:57.681 --> 00:46:58.916 align:middle line:90%
They train.

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:01.986 align:middle line:84%
We do several levels
of training.

00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:05.489 align:middle line:84%
We start normally with a
group of about 200 people.

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:06.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And that we have
a five day training then we

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.029 align:middle line:84%
invite them to a second
level that is also five days

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and then the third level
is a three month project

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.472 align:middle line:84%
that they take on as a
group that challenges them

00:47:21.472 --> 00:47:23.440 align:middle line:84%
into stepping outside
of their comfort zone

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.776 align:middle line:84%
and manifesting something
extraordinary.

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:26.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:30.314 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: So the
groups have done things

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:33.484 align:middle line:84%
like created the largest
braille printing press

00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:35.085 align:middle line:84%
and Latin America
for instance or--

00:47:35.085 --> 00:47:36.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:47:36.387 --> 00:47:37.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: -- they build
orphanages or they build,

00:47:37.655 --> 00:47:42.593 align:middle line:84%
you know, rehabilitation
centers or they take, you know,

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.962 align:middle line:84%
undocumented kids that
are begging in the streets

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:48.465 align:middle line:84%
and bring them and
education and--

00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:49.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Huge thing.

00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:50.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: They're
huge things, huge things.

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:51.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:52.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: I had
one group that raise

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.939 align:middle line:84%
in three months 13.8
million dollars.

00:47:54.939 --> 00:47:55.706 align:middle line:90%
That's the record.

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:56.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness.

00:47:56.674 --> 00:47:57.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: That's
the highest.

00:47:57.107 --> 00:47:58.108 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:58.108 --> 00:47:59.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And what
they do with that?

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:00.578 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Well,
they actually, they--

00:48:00.578 --> 00:48:03.847 align:middle line:84%
this is the printing press,
the braille of printing press,

00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:05.215 align:middle line:90%
but they-- and they involved

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.451 align:middle line:84%
so many corporations
into donating things.

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:08.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: My goodness.

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:12.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And they involved
the institute for the blind

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and like they had the
largest movie cinema,

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.363 align:middle line:90%
what they call it the Company--

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:20.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Company.

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:25.469 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: -- in Mexico
donated 10 years of free movie,

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and going to the movie theater
for all of the blind kids.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:31.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And
someone to go with them.

00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:34.345 align:middle line:84%
And so we quantify how
much money that is, right?

00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:36.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:38.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And what
I found interesting--

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:42.186 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that blind people
like going to the movies.

00:48:42.186 --> 00:48:44.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: They get to hear
this sensory experience, yeah.

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:45.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Because
it's a sensory experience.

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:46.357 align:middle line:90%
They love it.

00:48:46.357 --> 00:48:47.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's interesting.

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:49.259 align:middle line:90%
I've-- so you take these groups?

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:48:50.194 --> 00:48:51.061 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you
give them purpose?

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:52.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:54.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And they get to work
together in team building

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.265 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
that purpose--

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly.

00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:57.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: -- unrelated
to their businesses

00:48:57.201 --> 00:48:58.335 align:middle line:90%
and whatever they do in life.

00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:00.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And we
have, so the beauty is

00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:03.707 align:middle line:84%
that we'll have a CEO of a
large multinational corporation

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:08.746 align:middle line:84%
in that group and he's an equal
to an 18 year old who is in--

00:49:08.746 --> 00:49:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And then
that CEO will tell me often

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.753 align:middle line:84%
that cleaning the
bathrooms of the orphanage,

00:49:15.753 --> 00:49:18.255 align:middle line:84%
that they're supporting
and has been one

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:20.391 align:middle line:84%
of the most rewarding
experiences of his life.

00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:21.658 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:24.294 align:middle line:84%
And that you have this
company you have in Argentina?

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:24.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Argentina?

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:26.563 align:middle line:90%
I sold it.

00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:28.432 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know longer
run Argen--

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:29.900 align:middle line:90%
that company in Argentina.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.871 align:middle line:84%
We have a center in Chile and
in Mexico, in Mexico City,

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:36.440 align:middle line:84%
in Guadalajara, and I
start the company here

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.941 align:middle line:84%
in the US called
the World Works.

00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:39.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The World Works.

00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:40.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: That operates
in southern California.

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:41.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:41.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: And yeah.

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:42.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Great.

00:49:42.413 --> 00:49:43.614 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:49:43.614 --> 00:49:45.516 align:middle line:84%
OK. So another one of
your quotes that you have

00:49:45.516 --> 00:49:47.518 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure that you run these
throughout your companies are

00:49:47.518 --> 00:49:48.952 align:middle line:90%
about gratitude.

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:50.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:50.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you have a
big emphasize on gratitude.

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:49:52.056 --> 00:49:54.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Tell me what
that means in your life?

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:58.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: You know, I--
if you see yourself as a vessel

00:49:58.162 --> 00:50:01.865 align:middle line:84%
or a conduit for life
to manifest through you

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:05.936 align:middle line:84%
as you become spacious when you
give up stories, there is a way

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:09.807 align:middle line:84%
in which you express life by
giving, but there's also a way

00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:12.042 align:middle line:90%
in which you received life.

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:14.178 align:middle line:84%
So I always say it's
really important

00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:18.182 align:middle line:84%
to open the flood gates in terms
of your generosity and all--

00:50:18.182 --> 00:50:22.286 align:middle line:84%
but also open the
gates of gratitude.

00:50:22.286 --> 00:50:25.723 align:middle line:84%
And so gratitude is a
way of receiving for me.

00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, wonderful.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: It's
being present

00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:32.963 align:middle line:84%
to what life is offering right
now, being present to the moment

00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:34.932 align:middle line:84%
and receiving it,
and acknowledging

00:50:34.932 --> 00:50:36.834 align:middle line:90%
and realizing it's a blessing.

00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:40.137 align:middle line:84%
So being able to watch a sunset,
being able to look, you know,

00:50:40.137 --> 00:50:42.439 align:middle line:84%
to someone's eyes and
appreciate who they are,

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:44.441 align:middle line:84%
and being fully here,
fully present.

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:45.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In this moment?

00:50:45.275 --> 00:50:45.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: In this moment.

00:50:45.843 --> 00:50:47.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:48.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Right here, right
now, been able to just look

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.247 align:middle line:90%
at your beautiful smile.

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:51.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:50:51.315 --> 00:50:53.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And
experience the gratitude

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:59.356 align:middle line:84%
in that moment really in my mind
allows you to be able to express

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:03.260 align:middle line:84%
so much more life and be
more joyful like the breath

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.296 align:middle line:84%
of your spaciousness
that allows for something

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:08.999 align:middle line:90%
to come through is greater.

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:11.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, you did a lot
of these and I wasn't there,

00:51:11.502 --> 00:51:14.238 align:middle line:84%
but I understand that
you're with Don Miguel Ruiz.

00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:15.639 align:middle line:90%

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And the 20-- the birth
of the 2012, the night of 2012--

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:20.677 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:51:20.677 --> 00:51:21.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: -- December 21st.

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:22.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yes.

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.481 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And where were you?

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:27.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Teotihuacan, the
pyramids outside of Mexico City.

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:84%
We actually did a
ceremony in a grotto,

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.357 align:middle line:90%
a cave that was down underneath.

00:51:33.357 --> 00:51:34.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Underneath the pyramid?

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:36.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:38.162 align:middle line:84%
Well, the-- to the side of the
pyramids, under the ground.

00:51:38.162 --> 00:51:39.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, OK.

00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:40.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Not right
under the pyramids.

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:44.334 align:middle line:84%
And that we had 500 people
there and we road cast

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:46.803 align:middle line:84%
through the internet
to millions of people.

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:48.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness.

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:52.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And we wanted to
take advantage of the mythology

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:56.280 align:middle line:84%
of that particular day of
the end of the Mayan calendar

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.515 align:middle line:84%
because so much of
the wold was focused

00:51:58.515 --> 00:51:59.917 align:middle line:90%
on something happening that day.

00:51:59.917 --> 00:52:01.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:02.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: We wanted
to take that opportunity

00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:05.389 align:middle line:90%
to bring awareness in the--

00:52:05.389 --> 00:52:08.926 align:middle line:84%
into this possibility of
a collective awakening

00:52:08.926 --> 00:52:11.828 align:middle line:84%
of ushering a new way of being
in the world-- the humanity.

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:12.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:13.163 align:middle line:90%
Like a celebration.

00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:14.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:16.133 align:middle line:84%
And so, we, you know, with
Barbara Marx Hubbard, and,

00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:19.369 align:middle line:84%
you know, Stephen Dinan, and we
were connecting all these hubs

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:21.638 align:middle line:84%

and so we connect it

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:24.608 align:middle line:84%
from all these different centers
around the world to broadcast

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to the world about
this possibility,

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:34.218 align:middle line:84%
to affirm that we are
evolving into human beings

00:52:34.218 --> 00:52:36.587 align:middle line:84%
that will be more
kind and more--

00:52:36.587 --> 00:52:37.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Conscious.

00:52:37.955 --> 00:52:38.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: -- loving and
conscious and aware and yeah--

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

Miguel walking

into the pyramid in the sunset.

00:55:24.588 --> 00:55:26.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Don
Miguel, actually, you know,

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:29.926 align:middle line:84%
we talked about generosity
and gratitude.

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:33.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: The way that I've
came into that realization was--

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:35.932 align:middle line:84%
in the conversation with
Don Miguel, he said,

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:40.337 align:middle line:84%
"You know Gabriel,
love is the equilibrium

00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:43.006 align:middle line:84%
between generosity
and gratitude."

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:46.476 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "What
a strange saying."

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:48.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Equilibrium
between generosity and--

00:55:48.879 --> 00:55:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: And gratitude.

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.581 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- and
then I realized, "Oh,

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:54.351 align:middle line:84%
so if generosity
is about giving,

00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:56.153 align:middle line:84%
gratitude must be
about receiving."

00:55:56.153 --> 00:55:59.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And that's-- and
love is the equilibrium

00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:00.590 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: It is like
that you are the space for--

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.728 align:middle line:84%
in between the giving
and the receiving.

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:09.866 align:middle line:84%
And the receiving sometimes
was often receiving the gifts

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:15.372 align:middle line:84%
that life has for you even when
it doesn't appear to be a gift.

00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:18.875 align:middle line:84%
And forgiveness-- and then I
realized forgiveness is critical

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:22.712 align:middle line:84%
then, because unless
you forgive,

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:24.214 align:middle line:90%
you're stuck in the resentment.

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:27.651 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really
receive very much anymore.

00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:31.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That is very
true in many ways.

00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:35.459 align:middle line:84%
So, in your gift, what
you have is the ability

00:56:35.459 --> 00:56:39.796 align:middle line:84%
to ask these questions to people
to really-and it's not an effort

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.198 align:middle line:84%
for you, but to ask
the questions

00:56:41.198 --> 00:56:43.700 align:middle line:84%
that get the person
to the next level.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.068 align:middle line:90%
How can we learn how

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:47.304 align:middle line:84%
to ask those questions
or-- in that instance?

00:56:47.304 --> 00:56:48.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: OK, so, great.

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:52.042 align:middle line:84%
I think that anything that
is not working in our life,

00:56:52.042 --> 00:56:55.879 align:middle line:84%
everything that you're
in resistance to,

00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:59.816 align:middle line:84%
anything that you think, "Oh,
this shouldn't be this way."

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:01.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That it's
upsetting or causing--

00:57:01.318 --> 00:57:02.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Anything
that is causing an upset.

00:57:02.953 --> 00:57:06.323 align:middle line:84%
And the most generic way of
speaking about it is that you're

00:57:06.323 --> 00:57:07.757 align:middle line:90%
in resistance to it, right?

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:12.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: You don't want
to wait-- you know, you wait,

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:15.165 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
have more money

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:16.566 align:middle line:90%
and you're in resistance to--

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:17.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:19.002 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: -- however
much money you're making.

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:20.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: People that
upset you, whatever, yeah.

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:27.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And so, then, ask
yourselves, "What is the story

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:31.114 align:middle line:84%
that I am being right about
such that I'm bringing

00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:34.284 align:middle line:84%
into my life this
particular situation?"

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:35.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: OK.

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:36.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: That's the
first question to ask.

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:37.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: What
is the story--

00:57:37.521 --> 00:57:38.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Story.

00:57:38.889 --> 00:57:40.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: -- that I'm up
to validating or being right

00:57:40.524 --> 00:57:43.894 align:middle line:84%
about by having this
person in my life

00:57:43.894 --> 00:57:46.296 align:middle line:84%
or getting this situation
in my life?

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:47.430 align:middle line:90%
And then it's simple.

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:50.000 align:middle line:84%
You answer that question,
you know.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.004 align:middle line:84%
If you're in resistance to,
you know, your husband cheating

00:57:54.004 --> 00:57:56.640 align:middle line:84%
on you or your wife,
you know, flirting or.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:01.244 align:middle line:84%
So, what is the story that
I'm trying to validate?

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:03.213 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll say
to yourself something

00:58:03.213 --> 00:58:04.948 align:middle line:90%
like that I can't trust people.

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And that showed

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:09.419 align:middle line:84%
up in my childhood
when, you go back there.

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:11.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And then you
go into-- so, when did that--

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.423 align:middle line:84%
the second step is, "When
did I made that up?"

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Decision
about yourself, right?

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:16.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: "When
did I make that decision

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:19.729 align:middle line:84%
and I now hold it
to be the truth?"

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:22.399 align:middle line:84%
And now recognizing it's
just an interpretation

00:58:22.399 --> 00:58:25.302 align:middle line:84%
that I'm constantly searching
and seeking for evidence.

00:58:25.302 --> 00:58:27.971 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And so, you can
actually shift and changed

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:31.074 align:middle line:84%
that conversation that you're
having about whatever it was

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:34.744 align:middle line:84%
in the past to the present
time and change that story.

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:35.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Absolutely.

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:38.648 align:middle line:84%
So-- and the way-- one
of the most direct ways

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:41.751 align:middle line:84%
of changing the story is
by going to the people

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:45.889 align:middle line:84%
that you're using in order
to validate the story

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:47.257 align:middle line:90%
and telling on yourself.

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:47.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:48.959 align:middle line:90%
That's powerful.

00:58:48.959 --> 00:58:50.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Telling
them, "You know what?

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I am going-- I am here to take
a 100 percent responsibility."

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:56.166 align:middle line:90%
I have been creating this--

00:58:56.166 --> 00:58:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: The story.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:58.201 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: --

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:01.504 align:middle line:84%
this relationship in a way that
serves me or feeds into a story

00:59:01.504 --> 00:59:03.173 align:middle line:84%
that I made up when I
was eight years old."

00:59:03.173 --> 00:59:04.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:05.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: And I'm not
going to that anymore and I want

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:08.745 align:middle line:84%
to invite you into a completely
different relationship.

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.347 align:middle line:90%
It's not fair to you.

00:59:10.347 --> 00:59:13.083 align:middle line:84%
I apologize and I
don't want to use you

00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:14.284 align:middle line:90%
to be right about anything.

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:15.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then you have
an accountably partner

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:16.653 align:middle line:90%
in that person I guess.

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:17.354 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Exactly.

00:59:17.354 --> 00:59:17.921 align:middle line:90%
And the beauty of it--

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:19.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: -- is
that the other person,

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:22.158 align:middle line:84%
90 percent of the
time, in my experience,

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:25.695 align:middle line:84%
will actually reveal the story
that they're validating--

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: About themselves.

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: -- about
themselves through you.

00:59:28.198 --> 00:59:28.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:29.699 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:30.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Nossovitch: Because
they're like--

00:59:30.467 --> 00:59:31.668 align:middle line:90%
they plug into each other.

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:34.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You can download
information about this

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.339 align:middle line:84%
and you can-- it's a full
audio course and questions.

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:37.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: Yeah.

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:38.742 align:middle line:84%
It's a full audio
course with guiding you

00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:43.446 align:middle line:84%
into identifying what the
story is and then guiding you

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:45.915 align:middle line:90%
through the steps to release it.

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:47.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's valuable
right there.

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:48.284 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:49.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Nossovitch: It's free.

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, you go
