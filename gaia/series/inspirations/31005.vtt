00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to our beautiful
Los Angeles studio.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So would you like
to reduce anxiety

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
by doing 12 minutes of
brain exercises a day

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
or would you like to
lose weight by doing

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.610 align:middle line:84%
13 minutes of guided
meditation a day?

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Or did you know that
you can actually

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
damage your brain with
too much negativity?

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:84%
These and more studies are based
on new brain scan research done

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Pennsylvania's Center

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:90%
for Spirituality and the Mind.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And joining me is one
of the leading experts

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
on spirituality, communication,
stress reduction,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, Mark
Robert Waldman.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:84%
He also has a new
book out called

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:84%
"How Words Can
Change Your Brain."

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.906 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK WALDMAN: I'm
delighted to be here.

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:02.322 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am so looking
forward to this conversation

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to get to see images

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.695 align:middle line:84%
that we don't usually get
to see as a regular public.

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the very
first time on any television

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.606 align:middle line:84%
where I've put together
some of the actual images

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to show you what the
brain really looks like.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have to take all of your
ideas about what the brain used

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
to be, how you
thought it functioned,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:84%
even the notion
of structure, you

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:84%
have to throw entirely out of
the window when you see this.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.111 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love that.

00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
doing this for us.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: You're welcome.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.136 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
going to be great.

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So tell me what is
the one word that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is the most negative word that
damages our brain out there?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: What we have found
to be the most powerful and most

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
dangerous word as far as
your brain is concerned,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
if I was to put you into
a brain scan machine

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and flash this word for
less than one second,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
you won't even know
that you've seen it,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:84%
it's going to release so
many stress neural chemicals

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually damage
specific neurons in the brain.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.547 align:middle line:90%
And the word is "no!"

00:02:02.547 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you just
damaged my brain.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.671 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: I just
damaged your brain.

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
repeat negative words,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and even saying "I don't
know if I like the idea,"

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
we have research that has
been collected, for example

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
from Barbara Frederickson,
that if you have

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
one negative word and three
positive words going on

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
within a conversation
within a particular minute,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:84%
so you can create like
a positivity ratio,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
if your positivity ratio
falls below 3 to 1,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
you'll permanently damage
your relationships,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:84%
you'll undermine the
company structure.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you can push
that positivity ratio,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
if you can have five, six, seven
positive words and expressions

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.305 align:middle line:84%
for each negative word or
expression and a slight frown,

00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is all you need to trigger
that stressful reaction

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But when you get that up to
that 5 to 1 positivity ratio,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:84%
those are the relationships that
last the longest and those are

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.372 align:middle line:84%
the companies that
actually soar.

00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, isn't
that interesting.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So in your marketing--
or what about parenting,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:90%
if you're saying no, don't, not?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Well, understand
that a young child

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:90%
is very impulsive.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have what's a
called motivational center

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And we want to go
after anything that's

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
new or different or
pleasurable or exciting.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.579 align:middle line:84%
So a kid is just
going to-- their ball

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:90%
will run into the street.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And they just want to go after
that ball and that's dangerous.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:90%
And so we yell, no!

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And every one of
you who just heard

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
that, I'm sure you felt a
slight tightening in your body.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
That turns off the motivational
center in the brain.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
That stimulates the fear
circuit in the brain.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
That sends out a different
set of the neurochemicals that

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.510 align:middle line:84%
literally stop you from moving
and make you turn around

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:90%
and run in the other direction.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's so interesting.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to look at a
lot of this on the screen--

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --so we can see
what this looks like.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So tell me what this
first image looks like?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:90%
It's spectacular in color.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at?

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Now, color doesn't
really exist in the brain.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's a new project called
the Human Connectome Project.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing--
it's the same thing

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that the geneticists
did in terms

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of mapping out the
human genome system.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But with the human brain,
you've got 85 billion neurons,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:90%
you have 85 billion glial cells.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about those
a little bit later.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But what you are
actually seeing here

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
is that you need to understand
that a single neuron

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in our frontal lobes where our
thought processes take place,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
where my imagination
takes place, where

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
my decision-making
process take place,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
these neurons can
send connections

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to the
brain, to the furtherest back.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So what you are
actually seeing is

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:84%
all of the connections that
take place in your frontal lobes

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:84%
where consciousness
actually exists

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and how it spreads back
through the rest of your brain.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.601 align:middle line:84%
And this is only a partial view
of how many connections there

00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
A single neuron can
make connections

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.460 align:middle line:84%
with 10,000 other neurons
at one particular time.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So this means that there is
no one part of the brain.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, you see
a model and they

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
would call this your visual
cortex and your parietal lobe.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:90%
These are arbitrary lines.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
But if neurons are
interconnecting

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and interweaving and flowing,
where do you divide the line?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Where does this frontal lobe end
and your visual cortex begin?

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:90%
It all blurs together.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So we have to understand
that this is a interconnected

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
system that has no
beginning or end.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Every part is constantly
interacting and communicating

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:90%
with every other part.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.703 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when people talk
about quadrants of the brain

00:05:38.703 --> 00:05:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and the frontal lobe
and so forth, it's--

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Made up language.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.276 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Made up language.

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like to say, well, we
have to talk about-- well,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:84%
there is this
particular area where

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
we notice that
consciousness begins.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And they'll call it the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
figure out that that

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
goes into the frontal lobes or
up into this particular point

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's better to
see these new images.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this image
that we're looking at here

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
is from the brain
imaging center.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
center that you were

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
talking about that created these
different types of graphics.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: So why I want to show
you this is that in the past

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:84%
there has been a rumor--
it's never been true.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
There's never been right
brain thinking and left brain

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
There's always
interhemispheric dialogue

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:90%
going on at both times.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And what you are actually
seeing are the connections

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that go from one side
of the hemisphere

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
through the center part of your
brain, over to the other side.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So again, there is this constant
dialogue and communication

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
going back and forth
instantaneously

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
between the front
side of your brain

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and the back side of your
brain, between the left side

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of your brain and the
right side of your brain.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
You do have two completely
separate hemispheres.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And each one looks at the
world in a different way.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
dialogueing with each other

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
all the time to create
a unified picture

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:90%
of the world we think we see.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.885 align:middle line:84%
So we've heard of the
language center of the brain

00:07:05.885 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and areas of the brain that
are responsible for emotions

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.462 align:middle line:90%
and communication.

00:07:11.462 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And
we're just beginning

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
to map out some of
the primary emotions.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And there are very
specific circuits.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
You know what causes
us to be afraid,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and what causes us
to be angry, and what

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
causes us to feel loving
and nurturing, each of these

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
have now have been identified
as specific brain circuits.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But they take place
in the lower part

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:84%
of our brain, where I can't even
show you many pictures of this

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
brain scan technology

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:90%
to go down that deep.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is that
our primary emotions never

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:90%
make it into consciousness.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Something else makes
it into consciousness.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we create a picture
of an emotional experience

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:90%
that we've just had.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And so normally what
psychologists call emotions,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to call feelings.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And feelings aren't real.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm feeling happy
and I'm feeling sad,

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:84%
this is taking place
between one to 10 seconds

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
after I've had an emotional
experience of either pleasure

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.235 align:middle line:90%
or pain.

00:08:09.235 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The lower part of the
brain is very simple.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It's either pleasant
or it's unpleasant.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.864 align:middle line:84%
But then that frontal
lobe consciousness

00:08:15.864 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and all those
connections that you

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:84%
saw in that first part
of that image over there,

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:90%
it's translating that feeling.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It's pulling up old
memories from the past.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
It's associating it
with old feelings

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that we've had in the
past and projecting it

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
onto what might
happen in the future.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Our frontal lobe
consciousness never even

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:90%
lives in the present moment.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So where exactly
does consciousness

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:90%
live in the brain?

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.064 align:middle line:90%
Is it located in the brain?

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:43.689 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We now know where it
exists, and how it emerges,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:90%
and where comes from.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It's true for all mammals
and probably all animals.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Most neuroscientists--
there's even

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
been a declaration
signed that we

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
have to consider
that all animals have

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
a form of consciousness similar
to what you and I have right

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.587 align:middle line:90%
And what happens--

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.503 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: --in this lower
part of the brain, when

00:09:08.503 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
we feel something that creates
a pleasurable sensation,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and that can be
something that's new,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
something that's
different, something

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that arouses our curiosity,
something that smells sweet,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
looks aesthetic or beautiful,
and this releases dopamine

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
from a little tiny structure
called a nucleus accumbens.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And it releases dopamine in
the lower part of the brain.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:90%
And guess where it all goes?

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Right up there into
the frontal lobes.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:90%
And this is what wakes you up.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you take your
little tiny fingernails

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
on your little tiny pinkie and
put one above each eye right

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
here, this is the
everyday consciousness

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are
living in right now

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and that every viewer
watching this is operating on.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost a habitual
form of consciousness.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not very aware.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
We are just processing and
we think we're seeing things

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and we're paying--

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We're awake.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: --attention
to our words.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:90%
We're awake.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:90%
We're conscious.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that all animals have.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is that also what
they call the alpha state?

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: We have to throw away
all of the EEG readings, which

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:84%
only read the outermost
layer of the skull.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:84%
We now know there's over 52
different types of brain wave

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
activities going on and they
change with every thought

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and feeling we have, second
to second to second to second.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So you maybe have an alpha
functioning going over here,

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.225 align:middle line:90%
delta here,--

00:10:29.225 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: --gamma in
the back over here--

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: --dissociative
brain waves down here.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're abandoning
the EEG models

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to understand more about
how these neurons begin

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to become active or deactivated
during different thought

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.975 align:middle line:84%
process and experiences
that we have.

00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fascinating.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So when we are talking
about accessing

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:90%
higher states of consciousness--

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Ah, yes.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.442 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --is that
we're accessing or--

00:10:58.442 --> 00:10:59.025 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: No.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:90%
We're not.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --increasing the levels
in our prefrontal cortex?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Right
now, you are not

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
in a higher state
of consciousness.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in a higher
state of consciousness.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:84%
There's not a listener
or a viewer out there

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.274 align:middle line:84%
that's in a higher state
of consciousness right now.

00:11:12.274 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because?

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Because this
is ordinary processing

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of information coming
in about the world

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
just to make sure
that we survive.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:90%
So I remain standing up.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So I organize my words in such a
way that you can understand it.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing unusual.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But we have found--
because what we're

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:84%
famous for is that
Andy Newberg and I,

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:84%
we've done the brain scan
studies of nuns, and Buddhists,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and Pentecostals
speaking in tongues,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and atheists praying to God,
and people doing affirmations.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And what we find out is that
there are specific processes

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:90%
and activities that you can do.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you have the person
in a brain scan machine,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see that these
two tiny areas of consciousness

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:90%
begin to expand and grow.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
You begin to bring online
more parts of frontal lobe

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
functioning that
increases your awareness.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And this awareness is
outside of words or language.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So the book that I wrote,
"Words Can Change Your Brain,"

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
the interesting thing is
that of the eight most

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
essential elements
of communication,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.854 align:middle line:90%
words are number eight.

00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
so fascinating.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're taking a look here at
the frontal limbic filters--

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
fibers-- that we were
talking about here.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So the states of consciousness
that you're saying

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.585 align:middle line:90%
exist in a meditative state.

00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Now, this slide
is particularly important

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
because here you see
everyday consciousness.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you hold that
negative thought, the moment

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
you heard the word
"no," or I say,

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:84%
"oh, I don't feel
good this morning,"

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
even if you're making
it up, this information

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
gets sent into deeper
brain structures that

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
activate a warning signal,
like in the amygdala.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So the moment you have
an imaginary fantasy

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.701 align:middle line:84%
thought-- I'm worried about
what will happen tomorrow--

00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:84%
what happens is that
the rest of the brain

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:90%
says this is happening today.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Put out an alarm.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Stop yourself.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So this stops you
from being motivated.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It turns off the
reward centers and that

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.800 align:middle line:90%
shuts down consciousness.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is the coolest
thing in neuroscience.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Every negative thought
and feeling you have

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:84%
interferes with the
process of you solving

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%
any problem that's
about to come up.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when someone
says be in present time,

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.317 align:middle line:84%
where you're not being attacked
or in fear or the negative

00:13:29.317 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
experience is not happening
at this very moment,--

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: You have to train it.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that actually
allows you to--

00:13:33.645 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.399 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --get to the next moment
with some cognitive processing.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And it's very
easy to train your brain

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:90%
to come into the present moment.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: But this feels
very unusual to do so.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.105 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean this makes
so much sense when you're

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:84%
trying to problem solve,
when you're stuck in grief,

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:90%
if you're in pain.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:84%
If you stick with
the present moment

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
that is not happening

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
in that present moment, it will
give you the cognitive ability

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.726 align:middle line:90%
to help solve the next moment.

00:13:57.726 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Let's
give the viewers

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:84%
an actual sense of how you
can change your consciousness

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.350 align:middle line:90%
literally in 60 seconds.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.434 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know what this is.

00:14:08.434 --> 00:14:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: OK.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Now in our previous
book, "How God

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Changes Your Brain" we found
that the fastest way to relax

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:90%
is to yawn.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And I have 43 documented studies
to show that yawning actually

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:84%
lights up your frontal lobes
and other parts of your brain

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that are involved
with consciousness.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:84%
But if everybody was to just
take a moment and just yawn.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you just move
around in slow motion

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and even take your
hands and begin

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
to touch your hands or your
face, in pleasurable moments,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.180 align:middle line:84%
you need to remember that
pleasure for the lower brain

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
is what motivates us to
take action in the world.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.137 align:middle line:84%
So just doing something
for a few seconds,--

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: --breathing,
relaxing, creating

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.220 align:middle line:84%
some pleasure, this
is releasing dopamine.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:84%
This brings you into
the present moment.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:90%
It feels really good.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Your brain wants more of it.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's very practical.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
We can now apply this to a
very stressful work situation.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Work as hard as
you possibly can.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But when the moment you begin
to feel some stress, which

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:84%
is those neurochemicals
shutting down

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:84%
the motivational center of
your brain, then take a moment,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
take a few deep breaths,
do something pleasurable,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
go give yourself a hug or get
a hug from somebody that you

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:84%
like, do anything that gives you
a momentary sense of pleasure.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:84%
This literally
refreshes your brain.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:90%
You get a burst of dopamine.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the best
drug in your brain.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's absolutely free.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:90%
It wakes up consciousness.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:84%
You can then go back into
work and work harder,

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.239 align:middle line:84%
have higher productivity
with less stress.

00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well taking this
to another level though,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
isn't simulating those pleasure
centers of brain, stimulated.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And dopamine is
released by things

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.225 align:middle line:90%
like buying something new,--

00:15:53.225 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --shiny objects,--

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.919 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Oh, God, yes.

00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --possibly pornography.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.715 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: These types of
things stimulate and release

00:15:59.715 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
the dopamine in the
brain, don't they?

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Is that why there
are shopaholics?

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the interesting
thing about the reward

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:90%
system of the brain.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
We know that the three
most powerful images

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
for human beings, first
of all are loving images.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Somebody hugging,
kissing, erotic images.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether
you're aware of it or not.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.555 align:middle line:84%
This stimulates your
lower brain into action.

00:16:21.555 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It simply wants more of it.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:84%
The other one is whatever
your favorite comfort food is.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:84%
This really lights up the
lower centers of your brain.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
one is, if I show you

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
a picture of a single coin
for one fifth of a second

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
while you're in a
brain scan machine,

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:84%
whatever activity
you're doing, you'll

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.930 align:middle line:90%
do with more power and force.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And these are university
documented research studies.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So money, it turns out, is
unique for human beings.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
The thought of wealth
drives us to work harder.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure center to
the lower part of our brain.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But understand
that pleasure, this

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:84%
is just a momentary
form of happiness.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
There are other
levels of happiness

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:84%
that transcend this basic
survival oriented thing.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
peace, or integrity, or think

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:90%
of whatever your most sacred--

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Happiness.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.003 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: --your most
sacred word would be,

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the things that you
desire most in life.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
These are very high,
abstract nouns and concepts.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
If we can visualize what peace
looks like, what it feels like,

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:84%
then the motivational
centers of the brain

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:90%
will begin to build models.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we can use
our conscious minds

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
to design strategies to get
more, and more, and more of it.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I call the motivational center
of the brain the M-drive

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:90%
or the desire to acquire more.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.072 align:middle line:84%
Because all mammalian
brains, no matter--

00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:51.030 align:middle line:84%
we get a little bit of
pleasure, you want more,

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:90%
and, more, and more.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:90%
And that comes to addiction.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:84%
If too much dopamine
gets released,

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
your behavior becomes
impulsive and then

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:90%
you can't stop doing it.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.330 align:middle line:84%
We could take probes
and put them right down

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
into the nucleus
accumbens, the center

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of your M-drive, your
motivational drive.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we fire
them, whether it's

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:84%
a rat brain or human
brain, you just literally

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.402 align:middle line:84%
feel like jumping out of your
chair and going for something.

00:18:15.402 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:84%
You might not even
know what it is.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.401 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that
makes so much sense.

00:18:18.401 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why movies that
stimulate those types of centers

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:90%
in the brain are so popular.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Does it also have
to do with violence?

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.428 align:middle line:84%
Does violence stimulate that
survivalistic part of the brain

00:18:28.428 --> 00:18:28.928 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:18:28.928 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: No.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.410 align:middle line:90%
It does the exact opposite.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So for example, here we're
talking about perhaps too

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:90%
much dopamine being released.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But some of us might
be dopamine deficient.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.275 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't have enough
dopamine being released,--

00:18:44.275 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Un-huh.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: --we're going to feel
anxious, worried, depressed.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to feel
like getting out of bed.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Again, we can
reverse engineer all

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.460 align:middle line:84%
of these spiritual meditation
strategies that we have.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you build--
if you consciously

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
choose to build pleasure
into your life every 20

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:84%
or 30 or 40 minutes,
you'll pull yourself out

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.215 align:middle line:84%
the depression faster than
any pharmaceutical drug

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:90%
on the market.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We mentioned that
at the beginning of the show

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle line:84%
with 12 minutes of, as you
said, building pleasure

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.442 align:middle line:84%
into the prefrontal cortex
of the brain, right?

00:19:18.442 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: You want
to become aware

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
of the pleasure that's already
happening in your lower brain.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, anything
new that's different,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that's curious, that's shiny--
you put a mouse in a maze

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and you put all kinds of odd,
unusual objects in the maze,

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that mouse, out of curiosity,
is going to go explore.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going
to do something else.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.603 align:middle line:84%
It's going to gather
it and it's going

00:19:39.603 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to hoard it off in a
corner of the maze.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So all mammalian
brains have a sense

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:84%
that something new may
be potentially useful

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:84%
in the future to solve a
problem that we haven't even

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.150 align:middle line:90%
encountered yet.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's the positive side
underlying hoarding behavior.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why if
you feel like you've

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.644 align:middle line:84%
gathered a whole
bunch of stuff-- oh,

00:19:58.644 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time to
read this magazine,

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
save it for later.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's
two years old, it's

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
like something is stopping
you from throwing it

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:90%
into the trash.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When I'm
faced with death,

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to need the magazine.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Because
there's a primitive part

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:84%
of your brain saying there
is knowledge in there

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
that will help me
to survive better.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And so we hang onto it.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to work a little
harder to let go of something

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
old to make room
for something new.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Understanding
this is so powerful.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Just knowing how the brain
works and giving us a window

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
into how our own
brains work will

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
help this curb these
types of behaviors,

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:84%
extreme behaviors, because we
do realize we're not in the cave

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
any longer and we do live in
modern society a little easier.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: There's three
fundamental disconnects.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like everyone
to really understand,

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:84%
these lower brain processes
that are taking place,

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.400 align:middle line:90%
these are instinctual.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:90%
This happens before awareness.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But the dopamine literally,
like I said, wakes us up.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.081 align:middle line:90%
It brings consciousness online.

00:21:01.081 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: But all
of our consciousness

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:84%
now is based on the old memories
that we have and distillations

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
from things that we
saw a few seconds ago.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So our conscious
perception of the world

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.210 align:middle line:84%
is very different from how
the back part of our brain

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:90%
has processed the world.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And how our back part of
the brain has processed

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
the world has nothing to
do with the world that's

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:90%
really out there.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
no color in the world.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:90%
You're not wearing blue.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Blue is an imagination
that's being dissected

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
in the visual cortex
and then reconstructed

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.190 align:middle line:90%
in our frontal cortex.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
The best guess that we have
is that the movie we see,

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:84%
everything that we
think we are seeing,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:84%
is again taking place
in this little two

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:84%
tiny areas in the
front of our brain.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not even connected to
with what we're really seeing,

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.894 align:middle line:90%
with what we're really feeling.

00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
connected to what's

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
really going on
outside in the world.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.405 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing is that it works.

00:21:58.405 --> 00:22:00.965 align:middle line:84%
Look what we've done
with our imagination,

00:22:00.965 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:90%
look what we've done.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But how come
you and I both see blue?

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Because our brains
are wired somewhat the same

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
color processing.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But there's blue
in the fabric of my shirt.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.009 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: No, there isn't.

00:22:13.009 --> 00:22:13.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't agree.

00:22:13.925 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: I understand.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.579 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a color
combination of yellow and green

00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:90%
that puts the blue into--

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: There are a
light waves in the world.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.495 align:middle line:90%
You'll agree with that, correct?

00:22:20.495 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.498 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Now, we
can't see light waves.

00:22:22.498 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:90%
You ever seen a light wave?

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Stars?

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] Yeah.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: We don't
see light waves.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:28.353 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:22:28.353 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Color does
not exist in the world.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Just open up your kid's high
school biology textbook.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:35.125 align:middle line:90%
It's right there, in fact.

00:22:35.125 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But people always
drop their jaw.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:90%
What you mean there's no color?

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:84%
If I hold up a
blue-green card here

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and I hold it next to
a green card over here,

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
see this as blue.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
remove that green card

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to hold
up a blue card here.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
see that as green.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll go back and
forth and you're

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
going to feel like
you're losing your mind.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Un-huh.

00:22:54.385 --> 00:22:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to do
with the eyes or the way

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:90%
that the eyes are wired?

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Not only that,
but color is word dependent.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't assign a
particular word to a color,

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
you might not be able to
recognize it so clearly.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are
cultures in the world

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:84%
who see a slightly different
color spectrum than we see.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But you can train
yourself to see them.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So because we have the
same delusional minds,

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
we can create the same
delusional reality.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And because we all
agree that that's

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:84%
the delusional reality
that exists out there,

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
we don't question the fact that
that might actually be a lie.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: The
brain doesn't care.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:90%
It just wants to survive.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It wants to have more pleasure
and it wants more of that.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So it takes me to
the place of looking

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
at the language
centers of the brain.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you could explain
what are the language

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.180 align:middle line:84%
centers of the brain,
when we talk about that?

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: We have dozens of
language centers in the brain.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.134 align:middle line:84%
And on this particular
slide, you're

00:23:53.134 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:90%
looking at a couple of them.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
You have several in
your temporal lobe.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So for example, words that are
coming in through your ears,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
they're processed by specific
types of language centers

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:90%
that we're again unconscious of.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.940 align:middle line:84%
We then have the words that
we read on a piece of paper.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Those are different language
centers, and the words

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that we read or being associated
with memories and patterns

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.660 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
language centers

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that are involved
with speech itself.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And these are the ones that
are much closer to frontal lobe

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.550 align:middle line:84%
What I want everyone
to understand

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:84%
is that there's all
kinds of dialogues,

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of specific
word-based languages going

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
on in different
parts of the brain.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the brain only
sends little tiny snippets

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:84%
of information into
frontal lobe consciousness,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to be precise four
chunks of information.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to say
to you, your brain

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:84%
can only hold four
chunks of information,

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:84%
you can repeat
back that sentence.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.524 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'd be in trouble.

00:24:53.524 --> 00:24:55.742 align:middle line:90%
Because I need more.

00:24:55.742 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Right.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But I'll bet you cannot say
with any degree of accuracy,

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:84%
a single sentence that I've
said prior to this moment.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Why not?

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you
told me to say my brain

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:84%
can only handle four
pieces of information.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Because not only
will it only hold four chunks--

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and this is why when you speak
too long to your partner,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:90%
it's a mistake.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We have what's called
the 10-second rule.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to have
an intimate conversation

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:84%
with anyone, speak
slowly like this,

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:31.785 align:middle line:84%
one sentence for 10
seconds, pause, stop, relax.

00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:33.567 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That would
never work with me.

00:25:33.567 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And you
take a deep breath.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.630 align:middle line:90%
That would never work with me.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I would say,
have you ever tried that?

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And you would say?

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Would you
like to try that?

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I might fall asleep.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: I bet that you won't.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're probably right.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.219 align:middle line:84%
That's what my husband
tells me at least.

00:25:55.219 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: I'll bet you--
that was two sentences-- I'll

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
bet you $10,000 that the
exact opposite will happen.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And you have a whole
audience out there of people.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And I will write you
a check for this.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:84%
If you speak one slow
sentence to your husband,

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.135 align:middle line:84%
take a deep breath
and relax-- this

00:26:12.135 --> 00:26:14.260 align:middle line:84%
is "What Words Can Change
Your Brain" is all about.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what I go around
the world training people

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:90%
how to do.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And businesses love it because
that one slow sentence, I stop.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Then you just
intuitively respond.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
If you come from
left field, I know

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.210 align:middle line:84%
you won't even have
heard what I said.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Why should I even
waste my words?

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
But this is enough information
for you to hang on to.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:90%
You say something back.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:90%
You do this exercise.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I have a CD that trains a
person to take that, through it.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And within four minutes,
about 25% of the audience--

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
we may have 200 people in the
audience paired up, doing this.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:84%
One slow sentence,
breathe, relax.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Intuitively respond,
breathe, and relax.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Tears are running down
individuals' faces.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to go down to a
conference of attorneys,

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
mediating attorneys, because
I teach the whole Southern

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:84%
California attorney
system how to do

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:90%
this type of communication.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And you have two highly
conflicted individuals.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And in mediation, if you have
one sentence in 10 seconds,

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.290 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to get
emotionally wrapped up in that.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.180 align:middle line:90%
You give another.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.535 align:middle line:90%
The next person says a response.

00:27:27.535 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:90%
The attorney says one sentence.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
In 20 minutes, we
can solve problems

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:84%
that normally take two to
three hours of mediation.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And so money wise
that translates

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:84%
from a $2,000 problem
into a $200 problem.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely fascinating.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So you had talked to me about
big ideas in the brain--

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Oh, yes.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and how big ideas
really change the brain.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
taking a look at here

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.390 align:middle line:84%
is the frontal
thalamic connection.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that where
the big ideas exist?

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: This is
the most amazing thing

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:84%
about frontal lobe
consciousness.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:84%
The more I immerse myself
in an idea, a value

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that I hold really important,
a goal that I really

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:84%
want to achieve--
and by the way,

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very important
to be able to visualize it.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.867 align:middle line:84%
If you can't have a picture
of what your big idea is,

00:28:16.867 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:84%
the lower part of your brain
won't know how the respond.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't get turned on.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It just sounds like it.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And so for something like peace,
that's kind of interesting.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.248 align:middle line:84%
You have to do a
little extra work.

00:28:25.248 --> 00:28:28.992 align:middle line:84%
You have to visualize
peaceful scenarios, scenes

00:28:28.992 --> 00:28:29.700 align:middle line:90%
that create that.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
imagine yourself sitting

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:84%
with a very incredible, peaceful
expression on your face.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about love?

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: The same with love.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Same thing.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.399 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: You need a picture.

00:28:39.399 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:84%
With the picture, now
your brain gets pleasure

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:90%
from that picture.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
That dopamine raises
consciousness.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.160 align:middle line:84%
The frontal lobe
processes now can

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
create strategies to
move towards that goal.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
As long as your
brain knows that you

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:84%
were moving towards the goal,
more dopamine gets released.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what keeps you
going throughout your goal.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Again, bring in the slightest
negative thought, "oh,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:90%
maybe I won't succeed."

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And then what you are
seeing in this picture,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.390 align:middle line:90%
I have that thought.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I won't succeed.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:84%
That information
is sent into one

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.620 align:middle line:84%
of the deeper parts
of the brain here.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:90%
This is the thalamus.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The thalamus, most
people used to think just

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:90%
processes sensory information.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So something you see,
or hear, or smell,

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:90%
it goes to the thalamus.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can see all
of the connections

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that the thalamus
sends this information

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:84%
to all the rest of the
parts of the brain.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But the thalamus deals
with every thought

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:84%
you have as if it's a
real sensation coming in

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.930 align:middle line:90%
from the outside world.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:41.070 align:middle line:84%
It does not distinguish between
imagination and reality.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine you're going
to be successful at achieving

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:84%
any goal that brings you a sense
of pleasure and satisfaction,

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.870 align:middle line:84%
that information goes
out to your brain,

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
boom, a great
release of dopamine.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you find
yourself climbing out

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of your chair to go do that
because your lower brain is

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.430 align:middle line:90%
greedy and selfish and hungry.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And it wants more of that thing
called peace, or happiness,

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:84%
or success in any way
you want to imagine it.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.991 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that kind of how the
law of attraction might work?

00:30:12.991 --> 00:30:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: This is the
neurological law of attraction.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.031 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Attraction.

00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: So in
your mind, whatever

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.170 align:middle line:84%
you think, the
rest of your brain

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
is going to assume
that that's reality.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.324 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:30:23.324 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And again, the
slightest negative thought

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
causes a bit of a
frown in your face.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And the moment another
human being sees--

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
remember when I said that
words were number eight?

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Number one is facial expression.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Ekman has identified
10,000 facial expressions.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But there's only one
facial expression

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.210 align:middle line:84%
that creates
instantaneous trust.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we describe in
a whole chapter of this book.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we created one
specific exercise.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we teach on
day one, class number one,

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:58.660 align:middle line:84%
to all of the executive MBA
students at Loyola Marymount

00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.340 align:middle line:90%
University.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.140 align:middle line:84%
We ask a person to close their
eyes, take a deep breath,

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:90%
relax.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And ask them, what is your
deepest, innermost value?

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And we ask them
to do this for one

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:84%
minute, every
morning for 10 days.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Many people will say
what kind of New Age

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.600 align:middle line:90%
hocus pocus BS is this?

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, BS can be brain
science, or not.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But by about day five--
we've done this now

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
for four years--
90% of the students

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:84%
say this exercise should be
taught to every MBA student

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:90%
across America.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Because what we
found happened is

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that by focusing for one
minute on what your deepest,

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:84%
innermost value is for that
day, it reduces the stress

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.880 align:middle line:84%
throughout the whole
rest of the work day.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And executive MBA
students-- these

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.910 align:middle line:84%
are people already running
$1 million, $10 million,

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.690 align:middle line:90%
$100 million companies.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.740 align:middle line:84%
They're working 10,
12, 14 hours a day.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.365 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um-huh.

00:31:54.365 --> 00:31:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Um-huh.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.463 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And for one person,
the word that came up for them,

00:31:57.463 --> 00:31:59.160 align:middle line:90%
their deepest value was family.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that
exercise-- he was a CEO--

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:84%
he realized it wasn't
worthwhile spending

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.750 align:middle line:90%
12 hours in the office.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So he cut back three hours
and devoted those three hours

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.540 align:middle line:90%
to his sacred value.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.450 align:middle line:84%
This is your own
inner spirituality.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Your inner values is
your own inner religion.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have spiritual
circuits in our brain

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that are based upon
our highest ideals

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that take us beyond the
moment to moment happiness

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to the deeper levels
of satisfaction.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is how
you spend 12 minutes a day

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.290 align:middle line:90%
discovering your greatest value.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And that helps you
get rid of anxiety.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:84%
If your value is health, that
can help you with weight loss.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
If your value is
spirituality, that

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.265 align:middle line:90%
can help you with relationships.

00:32:42.265 --> 00:32:43.600 align:middle line:90%
It's across the board this way.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.500 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.374 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Eating, yeah,
eating is wonderful.

00:32:46.374 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:84%
If you-- in slow motion-- you
take a look at meditation.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:90%
What's involved in meditation?

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Many times you're just
slowing down the process.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you slowly
picked up your fork

00:32:55.810 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and you slowly took a small
piece of food onto the fork,

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and then you study
it, and you watch it,

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and you observe it,
and then hold it

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.110 align:middle line:84%
on your tongue for
20 seconds, you'll

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:84%
discover incredible
sensations and flavors

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:90%
you never noticed before.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.395 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Will you actually
get full faster that way?

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.020 align:middle line:84%
This will actually satiate
because so much pleasure

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:90%
is being released.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:84%
The brain, again, works
on the pleasure principle.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.960 align:middle line:84%
What normally we'd
be doing, we're

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:84%
eating so fast, oh, there's
a bowl chocolate ice cream.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:90%
I love chocolate ice cream.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:90%
You're gobbling it down.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:84%
All you're doing is
eating your memory.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:84%
You're not taking the
time to really experience

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.530 align:middle line:84%
the color, the shape,
the textures, the tones.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
By slowing things
down and meditating

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.280 align:middle line:84%
on a single morsel
of food-- we've

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:84%
done the first brain scan study
at University of Pennsylvania,

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Andy Newberg and I. And you
can see deep down in your brain

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
a part of the caudate
nucleus that gives you

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.265 align:middle line:84%
more conscious control
over what you want to eat.

00:33:57.265 --> 00:34:00.490 align:middle line:84%
You have more power to choose
to eat what you really want.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And now you can use your
sensation and pleasure senses

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.676 align:middle line:90%
to eat what you really like.

00:34:07.676 --> 00:34:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
immerse yourself

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:84%
into what gives you the
most amount of pleasure,

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.534 align:middle line:84%
the less you eat because
you get satisfied quicker.

00:34:13.534 --> 00:34:14.159 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Faster.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Most of us eat at our desks,
or driving, fast foods.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.370 align:middle line:84%
That pleasure center of the
brain is never stimulated.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: We
forget how important

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.144 align:middle line:90%
that momentary pleasure is.

00:34:24.144 --> 00:34:26.144 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is dieting
through mind control.

00:34:26.144 --> 00:34:27.219 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:28.570 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So now on the
opposite side, what

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.664 align:middle line:84%
happens in the brain when
fear is simulated and pain

00:34:33.664 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:90%
is stimulated.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.916 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Well,
that's why I want

00:34:35.916 --> 00:34:38.550 align:middle line:84%
you to take a look at this next
slide that we have up here.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:84%
These are the actual
neural connections

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:90%
from the visual cortex.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you see an unpleasant
picture, which could simply

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:84%
be your spouse frowning
at you or whatever else,

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.100 align:middle line:84%
or somebody's just anxious about
something, or whatever else,

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.230 align:middle line:84%
these tiny
micro-expressions is enough.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that the
neural circuits actually

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.790 align:middle line:84%
go all the way down into
the center of the brain.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little
tiny part of the brain

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:90%
there called the amygdala.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And in Greek, "amygdala"
stands for almond.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is the part of your
brain that makes you go nuts.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So this sends sends
out a warning system

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:90%
saying stop, potential danger.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And it sits right next to the--
motivation center starts right

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:84%
at that point where
that green line ends.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So that literally turns off the
motivation center that quickly.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's on, off, on, off.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Bring in a pleasurable
image, the pain,

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.680 align:middle line:90%
fear circuit gets turned off.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And now focus on a
pleasurable image, somebody

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
that you deeply
love and care for.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:84%
The more you hold
that image, you'll

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.390 align:middle line:84%
see a Mona Lisa smile
form along in your face.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a whole separate
chapter that we do on that.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And that half smile is what
will make the other person

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:52.526 align:middle line:84%
neurologically trust you
the moment they see it.

00:35:52.526 --> 00:35:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is the image.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.000 align:middle line:90%
How fascinating.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And those are
involuntary muscles.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So again, the exercise
is very simple.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Just take a minute to think
about somebody you deeply

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.910 align:middle line:84%
love and care for or an
event that brings you

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:90%
deep satisfaction from the past.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.990 align:middle line:84%
That memory is enough to
create that half smile.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel that pleasurable
release of dopamine.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:84%
The other person's
brain-- and this

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.560 align:middle line:90%
is called neural resonance.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the way in which
we understand each other.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Your brain will begin to fire
in the way my brain is firing.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm having
pleasurable, loving,

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.800 align:middle line:84%
compassionate thoughts,
the same circuits

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.015 align:middle line:84%
will begin to fire
in your brain.

00:36:36.015 --> 00:36:38.829 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll literally be
on the same brainwave.

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's what that means.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the Mona
Lisa smile is so popular

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
is because it's such an
affirming, peaceful look.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when the brain
gets confused, and diffused,

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and scattered, and
ADD, and all of that?

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.487 align:middle line:84%
What does that look
like, lack of focus?

00:36:55.487 --> 00:36:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: This is the
other important thing

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that we've just discovered
about the frontal lobes.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.410 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the
right frontal lobe

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
spends a lot of
its time processing

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:09.490 align:middle line:84%
negative fantasies, so your
self-doubts, your worries

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:90%
and fears.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:84%
These are just
imaginary thoughts.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, what if this went wrong?

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.465 align:middle line:90%
What if that went wrong?

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Un-huh.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Now with
that information,

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.350 align:middle line:84%
your left frontal lobe should be
saying well if that went wrong,

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I could do A, B, C,
and D. So it looks

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.610 align:middle line:84%
like your left frontal
lobe is the optimist

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.005 align:middle line:84%
and your right frontal
lobe is more the pessimist.

00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:31.296 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The problem is that
the right frontal lobe gets

00:37:31.296 --> 00:37:34.290 align:middle line:84%
more exercise than
the left, by having

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:37.077 align:middle line:84%
negative thinking and
shame, blame, guilt, fear.

00:37:37.077 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: We don't have
enough information to say that.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But again, what we have
found from the meditation

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:84%
studies, and
particularly the studies

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.410 align:middle line:84%
by Ritchie Davidson at the
University of Wisconsin,

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.930 align:middle line:84%
is that we see that
people who are doing

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.160 align:middle line:84%
meditations focusing
on self-love,

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and kindness, and
generosity and virtually

00:37:55.630 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
any form of gentle,
imaginary, or concentration--

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.280 align:middle line:84%
even yoga, for example,
you get the same kind

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:90%
of brain simulation going on.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
We see an increase in
the right frontal lobes.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So we know that positivity
is beginning to be built.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And we see stimulation going
on in some of the newest

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.850 align:middle line:84%
centers of the brain like
the anterior cingulate, which

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:24.090 align:middle line:84%
is where compassion and
empathy begin to emerge.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so in
brain diffusion--

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.010 align:middle line:84%
this is where the slide
that we're looking at here--

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.210 align:middle line:84%
is the right and
left communicating?

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Well, these are
new types of brain images

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that are called brain
diffusion images.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
is being able to learn

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.240 align:middle line:84%
how to actually map how
the connections from one

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.414 align:middle line:84%
part of the brain, how
those neurons send out axons

00:38:47.414 --> 00:38:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and connect to other
parts of the brain.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
another image showing

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.410 align:middle line:84%
how one small part of the
brain sends out information

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.130 align:middle line:90%
to the whole rest of your brain.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we have actually a
moving image of this as well,

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.606 align:middle line:90%
where you can see--

00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --from
different perspectives

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.374 align:middle line:90%
what this looks like.

00:39:04.374 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So here you're actually
seeing the activity

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that's going on in
your left hemisphere,

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.530 align:middle line:84%
in specific, how it
connects through it, how

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.320 align:middle line:84%
it weaves over and connects
with different parts going on.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And every different
activity that you do

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to create a
different type of picture.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, remember even these
pictures, which should totally

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.080 align:middle line:84%
change the way you've ever
looked at the brain before,

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.930 align:middle line:84%
is not an accurate
picture because this

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.260 align:middle line:84%
looks like this is how
your brain is wired.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to throw away
forever the word "wiring"

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and substitute a brand new
word called "programming."

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.511 align:middle line:84%
Because neural plasticity
is the new name of the game.

00:39:41.511 --> 00:39:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.090 align:middle line:90%
This is what we get to see now.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited about that.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
These next images are what
neural plasticity actually is

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and what it looks
like in the brain.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And you say that we have
creatures in our brain

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:90%
that are actually neurons.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Oh my God, yes.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.865 align:middle line:84%
So in this first one,
I want to tell you

00:39:57.865 --> 00:39:59.740 align:middle line:84%
first of all we used to
think that there were

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.259 align:middle line:84%
100 billion neurons
in the brain.

00:40:01.259 --> 00:40:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And we thought they
were kind of hard wired

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of just
did the same thing.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Now we find out that
they are constantly

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.480 align:middle line:84%
moving around
throughout your brain.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And at birth, they
can actually move

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.021 align:middle line:84%
from the back part of the
brain to the front part

00:40:13.021 --> 00:40:13.720 align:middle line:90%
of your brain.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And different parts
continue to change.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.004 align:middle line:84%
Every time you
recall a memory, you

00:40:18.004 --> 00:40:19.170 align:middle line:90%
have a different connection.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.770 align:middle line:84%
You're never recalling
the same memory twice.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But we also have what's
called glial cells.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.760 align:middle line:90%
And "glial" used to mean glue.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But here I want to
see in this picture,

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see
that these glial cells

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.470 align:middle line:90%
are moving around neurons.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're fixing them.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.080 align:middle line:90%
They're healing.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like
their personal masseuse.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.070 align:middle line:90%
They're massaging these neurons.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:84%
They're helping them
have more energy.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:84%
They're recirculating some
of the neurotransmitters.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
They are the helper
cells in our brain.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And each one of our neurons and
each one of these glial cells

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.990 align:middle line:90%
has a mind of its own.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It can learn new behaviors.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You can teach it to
learn new tricks,

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.710 align:middle line:90%
move forward in the world.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You can traumatize it.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.425 align:middle line:84%
You can teach how to be
afraid of the environment.

00:41:06.425 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And all that is
done through our thoughts--

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: All of that
it is done-- yeah.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --and our environment.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.068 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: We can do that
through our thoughts.

00:41:14.068 --> 00:41:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And Eric Kandel won the
Nobel Prize in medicine

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.650 align:middle line:84%
for taking a single
sea slug neuron

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and showing that you can train
it to learn or traumatize it.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is true for every
neuron in your brain.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.075 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we get
to see some of this.

00:41:27.075 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: This is
very, very important.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Here you're actually
seeing neurons

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.170 align:middle line:84%
over a period of a few
hours actually reach

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:90%
out, connect with other neurons.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So these are live
living creatures.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.060 align:middle line:90%
These are a community of people.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.270 align:middle line:84%
You need to treat each
one of your neurons

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.934 align:middle line:84%
as if it has a mind of its
own, a life of its own.

00:41:48.934 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these
neurons are connecting.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
neural plasticity is.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Correct.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And these are connecting
through thoughts, habits,

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:84%
patterns, environment,
old memories.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: You damage one
part of your brain, the area

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.120 align:middle line:84%
next to your brain is going
to start growing neurons

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and connections in to try to
take over the function that

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.627 align:middle line:84%
was lost, after a
stroke for example.

00:42:08.627 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So can you actually
ever regrow those cells

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.950 align:middle line:90%
that are damaged from stroke?

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:14.859 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:42:14.859 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're working on now.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.775 align:middle line:84%
And the other cool
thing, and I'm

00:42:17.775 --> 00:42:21.280 align:middle line:84%
sure you've seen it in the
news, we can now put electrodes

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:84%
into your brain
and these neurons

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.250 align:middle line:84%
can connect with
those electrodes

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.684 align:middle line:84%
to control a robotic
arm, or a computer,

00:42:29.684 --> 00:42:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and thought processes,
or whatever else.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.872 align:middle line:84%
So you can use your
thoughts to communicate.

00:42:33.872 --> 00:42:34.830 align:middle line:90%
You could be locked in.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:38.620 align:middle line:84%
You may have lost all ability
to move your body, to speak.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Put a probe into the right
place and now you can actually

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:84%
move cursors on a
computer and communicate

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.370 align:middle line:90%
to the outside world.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:48.761 align:middle line:90%
It's just so fascinating to me.

00:42:48.761 --> 00:42:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a brain injury and I
damaged the prefrontal right

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.570 align:middle line:90%
cortex of my brain.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to rebuild
it, through EEG though.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.270 align:middle line:90%
So it was doing just that.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of EEG
working with neuroscience

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and stimulating different
parts of the brain.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.272 align:middle line:84%
Now, I get to actually see
what the EEG was doing.

00:43:05.272 --> 00:43:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: When you had
that damage by the way,

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.699 align:middle line:84%
did you notice any shift between
positive and negative thinking?

00:43:10.699 --> 00:43:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel happier or sadder.

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.614 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just
thinking about that.

00:43:13.614 --> 00:43:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I lost my memory.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went through that
memory loss, I was in a blissed

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:20.770 align:middle line:90%
out state.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Because it was to
your right prefrontal lobe.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I damaged the
negative side of my brain.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:26.996 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: If it
was the left, you

00:43:26.996 --> 00:43:29.506 align:middle line:84%
might have had a much--
you might be living more

00:43:29.506 --> 00:43:31.162 align:middle line:90%
in a nightmare.

00:43:31.162 --> 00:43:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank goodness.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.210 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized it helped
me look towards optimistically

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.920 align:middle line:90%
rebuilding my brain.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I damaged the
negative center of the brain.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And that's
what we do with our books,

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
and with our CDs,
and programs is

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that we take the exercises
that we know so that you

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:55.250 align:middle line:84%
can stimulate more of your
left frontal lobe processing.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where the
optimism and the decision

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
making takes place, in
creating a better balance.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:05.316 align:middle line:84%
And use other exercises so that
you get more activity and flow

00:44:05.316 --> 00:44:06.690 align:middle line:84%
going in key parts
of your brain.

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't suggest
anyone to damage

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.958 align:middle line:84%
your negative center
of your brain.

00:44:09.958 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:84%
However, it is one
of the reasons why

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.805 align:middle line:84%
I'm so committed to
getting positivity

00:44:13.805 --> 00:44:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
into the world.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.414 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Every time you start
worrying and doubting yourself,

00:44:18.414 --> 00:44:19.810 align:middle line:90%
you're damaging your brain.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And understand that
those worries and fears have

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.313 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with
the present moment.

00:44:24.313 --> 00:44:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The easiest solution
to this, the next time

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.922 align:middle line:84%
you find yourself being upset
about something, take a look.

00:44:29.922 --> 00:44:32.130 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that you're
pulling a memory from the past

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.838 align:middle line:84%
and you're projecting
it onto the future.

00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:36.534 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to go home and tell
my wife that I dented her car.

00:44:36.534 --> 00:44:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, how is she
going to react?

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Is she going to get mad?

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I said the
wro-- Take a moment.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.117 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath, relax,
come into the present moment.

00:44:44.117 --> 00:44:45.200 align:middle line:90%
None of that has happened.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't know how your
wife is going to respond.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.870 align:middle line:84%
If you walk in through
the door and you're

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.100 align:middle line:84%
filled with profound
love because you've

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.550 align:middle line:84%
train yourself to do this
in the present moment,

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:59.220 align:middle line:84%
your wife is going to
feel empathy for you

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and that will temper
her hurt and pain

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.620 align:middle line:90%
that you dented her car.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it really
is as simple as taking

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:06.984 align:middle line:90%
a deep breath and retraining.

00:45:06.984 --> 00:45:09.650 align:middle line:84%
When I get the images of what it
actually looks like-- sometimes

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.608 align:middle line:84%
when I'm driving home
after a long day at work,

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:13.500 align:middle line:84%
about two exits
before my exit, I

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.379 align:middle line:84%
start to have anxiety about what
the house looks like, and got

00:45:16.379 --> 00:45:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
homework, and cook dinner.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:20.600 align:middle line:90%
And I get pretty--

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.025 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: So try this exercise
and try it for seven days.

00:45:23.025 --> 00:45:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Each time you drive home
consciously choose--

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.274 align:middle line:84%
and by the way,
traffic is great.

00:45:26.274 --> 00:45:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I always love what
Tetnal Han said.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:31.540 align:middle line:84%
The traffic gets all stopped up
and you see those red lights,

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.920 align:middle line:84%
let that red light be
a reminder to stop,

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.190 align:middle line:84%
take a deep breath in, come
into the present moment.

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:37.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
80 miles an hour,

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.659 align:middle line:84%
you can't notice the
beautiful surroundings,

00:45:40.659 --> 00:45:41.950 align:middle line:90%
the trees that are on the side.

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:44.989 align:middle line:84%
We have beautiful
freeways in LA compared

00:45:44.989 --> 00:45:46.030 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a lot
of tree-lined freeways.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Drive
home and imagine

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.610 align:middle line:84%
all the wonderful,
pleasurable, enjoyable things

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.860 align:middle line:84%
that you can and will
do when you go home.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And keep filling
yourself with that.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:00.062 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel so incredible
when you walk into the door.

00:46:00.062 --> 00:46:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll find
out that your spouse

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:90%
hasn't done that at all.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And you'll will need
all that loving kindness

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:06.500 align:middle line:90%
to help pull them.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.210 align:middle line:84%
You'll have a neural war
going on, neural dissonance.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
You want them to resonate to
your peaceful and happiness.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that as long as
you stay in the present moment.

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the
wonderful sensations

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.460 align:middle line:90%
that are always taking place.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Your worries, fears,
and doubts, 90% of them

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.430 align:middle line:90%
are totally imaginary.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned how
to interrupt this--

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:84%
because I do what's
called neurocoaching.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can take a person
in less than an hour

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and often times get rid of
10, 20 years of a bad belief

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.727 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:46:37.727 --> 00:46:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you
know how the brain works

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.360 align:middle line:90%
and what it looks like.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting the opportunity
to take a look at these images

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.260 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.277 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:46:45.277 --> 00:46:46.735 align:middle line:84%
This is really one
of my favorites.

00:46:46.735 --> 00:46:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is what we're
talking about right now, right?

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing
is how a neuron

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:54.840 align:middle line:84%
decides to send out
axons to connect

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.810 align:middle line:90%
with other neurons going on.

00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So these are actual film of
what are called neurites.

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:02.380 align:middle line:90%
These are very young neurons.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we see the most
amount of movement taking

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.390 align:middle line:84%
place in the brain
when we are young.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Most of your brain
is not very active.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's just incredible how
they connect and disconnect

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.170 align:middle line:90%
all time.

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:17.050 align:middle line:84%
When you understand that,
you'll understand that you never

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.400 align:middle line:90%
recall the same memory twice.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
a negative memory

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and you recall it while you
remain peaceful, happy, focused

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%
on your deepest
innermost values,

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that's what gets embedded
into that memory.

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.090 align:middle line:90%
That goes back into storage.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And the next time something
triggers that memory,

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.520 align:middle line:84%
you'll also bring up
a bit of the memory

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.760 align:middle line:90%
of that peacefulness.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So our research shows that if
you spend one minute an hour

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:45.070 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day-- that's
about 12 minutes a day or just

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.520 align:middle line:84%
do 12 minutes of
meditation solidly--

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:84%
but we find a lot of people
just don't like to do that.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:54.799 align:middle line:84%
So we think that you can do just
a bunch of short meditations

00:47:54.799 --> 00:47:55.590 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:57.589 align:middle line:84%
We think that's actually
better because then you

00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:59.970 align:middle line:84%
get in the habit of always
training yourself to come

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.350 align:middle line:84%
into the present
moment, feel refreshed.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.700 align:middle line:84%
This is what's being taught
at Harvard Business School

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and at our school.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.370 align:middle line:84%
12 minutes a day,
eight weeks later

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:13.440 align:middle line:84%
we see not only the beginnings
of major functional changes

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.800 align:middle line:84%
taking place in
their brain, we see

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.030 align:middle line:90%
structural changes taking place.

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And in advanced mediators, you
can see functional changes,

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:23.830 align:middle line:84%
in your frontal
lobe for example,

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:26.140 align:middle line:90%
as high as 25% changes.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And in areas like
your thalamus, which

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.440 align:middle line:84%
is shaping the reality in
which you think you live,

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.940 align:middle line:84%
you can change it
by as much as 10%.

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:37.474 align:middle line:84%
We can actually look at a human
brain now and see what goes on.

00:48:37.474 --> 00:48:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
what we're doing

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.070 align:middle line:90%
today, which is fascinating.

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I love that you're
sharing this with us.

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:42.424 align:middle line:90%
So now, what is this?

00:48:42.424 --> 00:48:43.590 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking at here?

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Here you're
looking at an unhealthy neuron

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and a healthy neuron.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And this healthy
neuron is trying

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.726 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
this poor neuron.

00:48:51.726 --> 00:48:52.600 align:middle line:90%
And we all have that.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's just not
quite-- it just

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:56.980 align:middle line:90%
isn't getting its act together.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think
it's fair to say

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that if you look
in the human brain,

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:07.560 align:middle line:84%
you see one of the most
amazing, cooperative communities

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.930 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Neurons do not fight
with each other at all.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.903 align:middle line:84%
There's no hostility
going on in them.

00:49:12.903 --> 00:49:14.194 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're always helping.

00:49:14.194 --> 00:49:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: They're
always helping.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:17.746 align:middle line:84%
They're always
helping each other.

00:49:17.746 --> 00:49:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So they're always
helping grow, connect,

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.020 align:middle line:90%
take care of the damaged ones.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Create new
thoughts, seek new pleasures,

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:28.760 align:middle line:84%
create greater satisfaction,
keep you driving through life

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.140 align:middle line:84%
so that you have more of
both inner and outer wealth.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:34.835 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could this be what a
goal looks like in the brain?

00:49:34.835 --> 00:49:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: The goal-- I have
a burst of pleasure going on

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and my lower brain says
I want more of that.

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.306 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have to use
my consciousness

00:49:47.306 --> 00:49:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to decide do I really
want more of that or not?

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:52.024 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously, if I'm
trying to lose weight

00:49:52.024 --> 00:49:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and I have a bowl of
ice cream over here

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and a bowl of carrots over
here, I have a real problem.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:00.010 align:middle line:84%
A suggestion, get rid of the
image of the bowl of ice cream

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:02.990 align:middle line:84%
because I know how my brain
is going to respond to that,

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and go with what brings you
pleasure in terms of focusing

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:09.950 align:middle line:84%
on what your weight
loss goal is.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to teach
our hedonistic brain

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:16.240 align:middle line:84%
is how to anticipate
a future pleasure.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So always make sure for any
goal you have, large or small,

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.600 align:middle line:90%
two things.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.141 align:middle line:84%
One is you want to
make sure that you

00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:25.630 align:middle line:84%
give constant little pleasurable
rewards, every hour of the day

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.060 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day, as you
move towards that goal.

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And then make sure you have
a really nice, big reward

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that you know is
going to satisfy.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the reward could be
the image of a healthy body.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.700 align:middle line:84%
The reward could be the image
of looking over the ocean

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:84%
after you've bought the
ideal house of your dreams.

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:47.477 align:middle line:84%
The reward could be how you
would look in that picture

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:49.060 align:middle line:84%
that you take of
yourself or whatever.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.996 align:middle line:84%
Those are enough to
simulate the dopamine--

00:50:51.996 --> 00:50:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and the reward
centers of the brain.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: The brain doesn't
care whether it's a big--

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So visualization
is powerful.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:57.605 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: --or
a small pleasure.

00:50:57.605 --> 00:51:00.370 align:middle line:84%
We tend to forget that
pleasure is something

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.280 align:middle line:90%
that is absolutely essential.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, some
spiritual scriptures,

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.280 align:middle line:84%
they look at people who are
incredibly hedonistic and very

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:08.780 align:middle line:90%
selfish.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
downside of pleasure.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The more pleasure I feel,
the more pleasure I want.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes me, me,
me, me, me, me, me, me.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Now social forces come in.

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have social
circuits in the brain.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:25.760 align:middle line:84%
If we do not share our inner and
outer wealth with other people,

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.780 align:middle line:84%
if we do not share our
kindness and generosity,

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:33.010 align:middle line:84%
if we do not share our material
wealth and with others,

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:35.790 align:middle line:84%
others feel envious and
they will punish us,

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:37.440 align:middle line:90%
even at a loss for themselves.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So there is a very interesting
socioneurological process

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:43.900 align:middle line:90%
that takes place.

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And we are forced-- if we
act greedy, we get punished.

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways of--
like even if you simply

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:55.080 align:middle line:84%
keep repeating may I be
happy, may I be well,

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.190 align:middle line:84%
may I filled with
love and peace.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.260 align:middle line:84%
May you be happy,
may you be well,

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.660 align:middle line:84%
may you be filled
with love and peace.

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.420 align:middle line:84%
May we be happy, may
we be well, may we

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.770 align:middle line:90%
be filled with love and peace.

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.090 align:middle line:84%
This turns out to
be one most powerful

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:12.500 align:middle line:84%
neurological
meditations we've found.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.190 align:middle line:84%
This stimulates a
part of the brain that

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:19.500 align:middle line:84%
allows us to feel deeper
empathy and compassion.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And this part of
your brain is barely

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:90%
functional before the age of 30.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, isn't
that interesting.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.640 align:middle line:84%
This could actually be the
secret to anti-aging as well.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.759 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this
slide shows us the--

00:52:32.759 --> 00:52:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: So here's
a single neuron.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And this neuron, this
is a very simple neuron.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:84%
It only has about maybe 10 or
12 axons at the tip going on.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely, you can
actually see within the neuron,

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds
of flow going on.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:50.810 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
neuroelectrical and

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.050 align:middle line:90%
neurochemical activity going on.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And that information
worked its way to the tips.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the tips decide how
to connect with other neurons

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.690 align:middle line:90%
to pass that information on.

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So those--
that is actually

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.396 align:middle line:90%
a memory that could be started.

00:53:05.396 --> 00:53:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And those little tentacles reach
out and connect with another--

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Correct.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:09.856 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --neuron,
which forms a bridge.

00:53:09.856 --> 00:53:10.563 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Right.

00:53:10.563 --> 00:53:12.490 align:middle line:84%
A memory is going to be
a collection of those.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we are at the
point that we now

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:17.740 align:middle line:84%
know we can begin to extinguish
negative memories if we catch

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.010 align:middle line:90%
them within the first 24 hours.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So we take a
traumatic event and we

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.440 align:middle line:84%
do various forms of positive
thinking and neutralizing.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes just sitting back
and watching our thoughts,

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and watching a
negative reaction,

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:33.540 align:middle line:84%
while we stay deeply relaxed,
is enough to extinguish

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.195 align:middle line:84%
the formation of
a negative memory.

00:53:35.195 --> 00:53:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of the
most powerful things

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that you said to me is
that negative words can

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:40.305 align:middle line:90%
damage the brain.

00:53:40.305 --> 00:53:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Yes.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we actually have
an example of what that looks

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:46.507 align:middle line:84%
like, of what a negative
thought, or word, or pattern--

00:53:46.507 --> 00:53:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: Well, the first
slide that we're showing here

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.631 align:middle line:84%
is just-- another thing,
I want to show you

00:53:50.631 --> 00:53:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that glial cells, again, they
give birth to themselves.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually seeing
procreation take place

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.670 align:middle line:84%
with some of the most
important cells in our brain.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, we tend
to always think

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:05.336 align:middle line:84%
about neurons--
this is well known

00:54:05.336 --> 00:54:07.960 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific community, but
not in the general community--

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.470 align:middle line:84%
that these glial cells,
these are living creatures

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that we want to respect,
and nurture, and encourage

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:15.890 align:middle line:90%
their growth and development.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do we
get more glial cells?

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: These types
of meditation exercises,

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.930 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of optimistic
forms of thinking,

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:25.510 align:middle line:84%
affirmations, the things
that Andy and I have

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:27.450 align:middle line:90%
talked about in these two books.

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:30.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the documentation
of how we do that.

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:34.420 align:middle line:84%
If we choose how we communicate,
in a slow, relaxed, positive

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:40.590 align:middle line:84%
way, we're helping each other
grow a thicker neocortex.

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing
about these meditations,

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.740 align:middle line:84%
it actually shrinks
the amygdala,

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.030 align:middle line:84%
that fear processing
part of your brain.

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure
electromagnetically,

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:53.332 align:middle line:84%
those types of thoughts go
out and emanate beyond you.

00:54:53.332 --> 00:54:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: So here's what
happens if you really

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.570 align:middle line:84%
want to meditate
on a negative word.

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.340 align:middle line:84%
There you actually see, up in
the upper part of the screen,

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and we'll show it a
couple of times here,

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.640 align:middle line:90%
this is a neuron dying.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.400 align:middle line:90%
It's literally implodes.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the end of its life.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what a negative thought

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:11.300 align:middle line:90%
would do to the brain.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Can do, yes.

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can do.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.182 align:middle line:84%
It is how negative thoughts
can damage the brain.

00:55:15.182 --> 00:55:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WALDMAN: Right.

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And the longer you
ruminate on negativity,

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:22.100 align:middle line:84%
the more you can become
neurologically entrapped in it.

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:26.336 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I think some people
who are just rageoholics.

00:55:26.336 --> 00:55:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have brain cells
exploding, imploding

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:28.510 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.634 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: We're not going
to be able to help them.

00:55:30.634 --> 00:55:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And sociopaths, there's
benign sociopaths.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a fundamental
disconnect.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:39.930 align:middle line:84%
They have lots of creative
ideas, how to make more money.

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean I do think
that it's fair to say

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that a good portion of
what we see on Wall Street

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.250 align:middle line:84%
are sociopathic
CEOs, who are driven

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:50.270 align:middle line:84%
to make more and
more and more money.

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And many of these people
we find in brain scans,

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.220 align:middle line:84%
they cannot feel that what
they are doing hurts other

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:57.110 align:middle line:90%
individuals.

00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:57.900 align:middle line:90%
They don't get it.

00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.954 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when some
people go and they experience

00:56:00.954 --> 00:56:02.370 align:middle line:84%
meditation, they
can never go back

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.757 align:middle line:84%
to that old way of
being because they've

00:56:04.757 --> 00:56:06.340 align:middle line:84%
awakened different
parts of the brain.

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're repairing
their brain.

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And
there's a problem too

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:11.210 align:middle line:84%
because anger gives you
the illusion that you're

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.970 align:middle line:84%
being rational when
it's the exact opposite.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So anger totally
undermines the ability

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.510 align:middle line:84%
to feel empathy
towards anyone else.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And it undermines your
ability to think clearly.

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:23.135 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you
get angry, you not only

00:56:23.135 --> 00:56:24.510 align:middle line:84%
kill the other
person, but you're

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:26.260 align:middle line:90%
killing yourself as well.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the bottom
line from everything

00:56:28.085 --> 00:56:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned
from you here is

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:34.810 align:middle line:84%
the power, the absolute power
of visualization, meditation,

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:35.870 align:middle line:90%
positive imagery.

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally repair
the damage of brain cells.

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And for every one
negative word that

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:45.160 align:middle line:84%
is said or spoken or
heard, three positives

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.020 align:middle line:90%
would actually come back.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: At a
bare minimum, push

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that positivity ratio
to five or seven.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Consciously work on--
even lying to yourself--

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:58.270 align:middle line:84%
this is a wonderful world,
this is a wonderful world.

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.060 align:middle line:84%
As that earlier drawing
showed, that information

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.039 align:middle line:84%
goes to the thalamus, the
thalamus says, world safe,

00:57:04.039 --> 00:57:04.705 align:middle line:90%
world wonderful.

00:57:04.705 --> 00:57:07.470 align:middle line:84%
It sends that message to
the rest of your brain.

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:12.120 align:middle line:84%
It's your choice, negative
world, positive world.

00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Both of these are
fantasies created

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.200 align:middle line:90%
by left and right frontal lobe.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Which illusion and
which fantasy do you

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.660 align:middle line:90%
choose to live your life in?

00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Good point.

00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Mark.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.730 align:middle line:84%
You are just a fountain
of information.

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate your knowledge
and sharing with all of us.

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:32.276 align:middle line:84%
>>WALDMAN: And please share
this with everyone else.

00:57:32.276 --> 00:57:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is a totally
new model of the brain.

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.420 align:middle line:90%
We need to get the word out.

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.240 align:middle line:84%
We need to let people know
how powerful affirmations,

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.660 align:middle line:90%
positive thinking is.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.760 align:middle line:90%
How important pleasure is.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:48.642 align:middle line:84%
How easy it is to use
repetitious forms of exercises

00:57:48.642 --> 00:57:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that have been drawn from the
world's spiritual traditions.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:51.590 align:middle line:90%
