00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Why
do we do the things

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.150 align:middle line:90%
that we know will hurt us?

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Is it a moment of forgetting
who we are or numbing the pain

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
or maybe succumbing to
the disease of addiction?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:84%
How do we expose these
shadows and shed some light

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.700 align:middle line:84%
into the deepest
parts of ourselves?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr, and joining
me is Chris Grosso who just

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:10%
finished his third book
on addiction and recovery

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:10%
called "Dead Set on Living."

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:10%
And along with 20 million
American adults and children,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:10%
Chris has struggled
with substance abuse

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:10%
and is here to talk
about how he overcame

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:10%
his struggle many times over.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS GROSSO: Thank
you for having me, Lisa.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It's great to have
you here again.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yes.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So catch us up a
little bit since the last time

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:90%
that we spoke.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you have
been through a couple

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:90%
of different challenges.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: I have.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:10%
I've been through some heavy
times, some great times.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:10%
It's life, the ups and downs.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, shortly after we had
met in Phoenix a few years back

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:10%
at the Celebrate
Your Life Conference,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:10%
I was, last you knew, living
in Canada and was married.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.234 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't that
long after that that--

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember
exactly how long,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:10%
but I ended up having a relapse.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:10%
And it was a pretty
rough relapse.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:10%
It actually almost took my life.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:10%
It was only 24 hours.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:10%
It started with
Percocets that I had been

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:10%
prescribed for a root canal.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:10%
And the addiction talks
to us in our own voice,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:10%
and it seems very
rational, though it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:10%
is completely irrational.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were there other things
going on in your life that--

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Sure.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle line:84%
I mean, leading up to
that, luckily the divorce--

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'm coming
ahead a little bit,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
but when my wife
and I got divorced,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:90%
it was pretty amicable.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It was not an ugly divorce.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
We were very respectful
of one another.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
But prior to that, things had
not been going well for us,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and I was definitely
struggling with that.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I was wearing myself very thin
with speaking engagements,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.650 align:middle line:84%
with traveling, with
writing working on.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:90%
I think only-- yeah.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
"Everything Mind" had just
come out, my second book.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.083 align:middle line:84%
So I'd been doing a lot
of work around that.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was not taking
proper care of myself.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I was not doing enough for
my own personal recovery.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I struggle, still to this
day, but I've got much better

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.569 align:middle line:84%
with boundaries, with saying
no to engagements or people.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I'm going through
this-- complete strangers.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me?

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's so hard for
me to not even say no,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
but, I mean, yeah, I guess
essentially say no in a way.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Like, I just--

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.737 align:middle line:90%
I spread myself too thin.

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Boundaries is a really--

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Big one.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --key issue,
especially for anyone--

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and I, in a way,
think that, in a way,

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:90%
we're all addicted to something.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: For sure.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If it's not alcohol
or drugs, it's shopping.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:90%
It could be relationships.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:90%
It could be work.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:90%
It could be exercise.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:90%
There's something.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yes.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In your mind,
what is an addiction?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:10%
>>GROSSO: So the best
description I've ever heard

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:10%
of it, it actually comes from a
world-renowned addiction expert

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:10%
named Gabor MatÃ©--

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:10%
wonderful, brilliant man.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:10%
And it's not verbatim, but he
said something to the effect

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:10%
of addiction is any behavior--
and these are the first words

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:10%
that are verbatim because they
just struck such a cord with

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:10%
me--

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.332 align:middle line:10%
any behavior, substance
related or not--

00:03:46.332 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:10%
so right there, he
kind of flips it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:10%
because most people
think of addiction

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:10%
and they think of a
heroin addict strung out

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:10%
under a bridge or an
alcoholic drunk in a gutter.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And for sure, that
has happened in life.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But that is not
the bigger picture.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So he goes on to say,
any behavior, substance

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
related or not, that has
negative consequences

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
in our life, but we continue to
do despite said consequences.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that day, that
Percocet prescription

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:90%
had a grip on you.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Once I put it in
my body, it did, absolutely.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And it landed me
essentially in the hospital

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:90%
when I landed in Florida.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.669 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you experience
shame at that moment?

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Oh, absolutely.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:90%
That is a huge part for me.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm not very unique,
in that sense, because that's

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
a big part of anyone
that struggles

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.134 align:middle line:84%
with addiction is the shame
and the guilt and the remorse.

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And the dangerous
thing about that

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.777 align:middle line:84%
is that then becomes
more fuel to continue

00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:90%
with your addiction.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.485 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was what
I was going to ask you.

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:90%
So the shame doesn't stop you.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It is unsolvable and you
just keep numbing, right?

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Yeah,
exactly-- keep numbing.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
But I also knew that I did not
want to go back down that road.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.426 align:middle line:84%
So when I got back to the
airport, I did call my parents.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I let them know right
away what was going on.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I called my old
college professor who

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:90%
has become very close to me.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school, I was
in school for substance abuse

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:90%
counseling.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And even though this
was many years ago

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.490 align:middle line:84%
that I was in school for that,
she and I, my old professor

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.320 align:middle line:84%
from college, became
very close, and she's

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:90%
like a second mom to me.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:10%
So I called her to let
her know, and I called--

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:10%
besides 12 steps,
I also do what's

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.370 align:middle line:10%
called Refuge Recovery, which
is a Buddhist approach to the 12

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:10%
steps, in a way, that Noah
Levine, the author of "Dharma

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:10%
Punx," started,
great fellowship.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:10%
And I should say, one need
not be Buddhist to do it.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.591 align:middle line:10%
It's a very helpful fellowship.

00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:10%
But I mention that because
I have the equivalent

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:10%
of a sponsor in the 12 steps.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's called a mentor
in Refuge Recovery.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I called
my mentor and let

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
him know what had happened
because I know that once you

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
end up in a relapse and
you actually pick up,

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I can't stop myself
at that point.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:90%
It's off to the races.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So I needed to tell him
myself immediately and let

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.925 align:middle line:84%
them know that when
I got home I wanted

00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:02.690 align:middle line:90%
to get into treatment and stop.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then when
you got to the airport,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:84%
were your parents
there and they--

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.683 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: It's blurry, but I
remember my parents waiting

00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:11.862 align:middle line:90%
for me in baggage claim.

00:06:11.862 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And they knew I'd been
drinking because I

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
told them and they
could smell it, see it.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's very obvious.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we got
back to their house, which

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.330 align:middle line:84%
was about 40 minutes
or so from the airport,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:90%
I was completely out of it.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And they had seen me,
unfortunately, like that,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
so talk about shame and guilt.
I have these memories of that.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:90%
They're still there for you.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why do
you think people

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:90%
who are in recovery relapse?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: A wonderful
question-- and it's

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
kind of the million dollar
question, so to speak.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
You ask experts
and you'll probably

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.380 align:middle line:84%
find some answers
that interject,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
get different answers

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.380 align:middle line:90%
from different perspectives.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And I can only really
speak to my own experience

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and the experience of those
I have worked with myself.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what I think a big
part of it is the relapse,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
actually, technically
happens before you pick up

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:90%
the substance.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It's in our behaviors and our
actions leading up to that.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Usually addiction experts
will say once you pick up,

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
that's when the relapse
technically kind of stops

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:90%
because then you're in go mode.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's the actions and
behaviors leading up to that.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, it's
pulling back from--

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I do attend meetings.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a part of my well-being.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:90%
I exercise.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:90%
I meditate.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of various things.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I take a very integral
approach to recovery.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But when I start pulling
back from those things

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.585 align:middle line:84%
and not giving myself enough
time for my own well-being

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and, going back to what
I was saying earlier,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:90%
spreading myself too thin.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And it can be tricky for
me because my line of work

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:84%
is enmeshed in not just
substance abuse, but healing,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:90%
well-being in general.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Speaking.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Yeah, speaking
about these very things.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Counseling.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.491 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Right, exactly.

00:07:56.491 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So going back to what I said
earlier again, that addiction,

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:90%
it talks to us in our own voice.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.759 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell myself,
it's OK if you're

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:84%
missing x amount of
meetings because you're

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.644 align:middle line:84%
doing work in the field,
you're engaging with people.

00:08:09.644 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We justify it.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: I totally justify it.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In everything.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yes.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: So that seems to
be the biggest part, the one

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:90%
common denominator.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there will
be obvious triggers.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, a death of a loved
one can send someone

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
into an addiction or a
relapse, a loss of a job,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:90%
a death in a family.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't even
have to be big things.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.232 align:middle line:90%
It can be a little things.

00:08:34.232 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're going
to talk about solutions

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and how, specifically, to handle
every one of those issues.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But first I want to ask
you, you just mentioned,

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:90%
is alcoholism a disease?

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And this is controversial.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Some say yes, and some say no.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: I try to place
Switzerland on this one

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.701 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you feel?

00:08:50.701 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: So I understand
the disease model of it.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people will reference
the AMA, American Medical

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:10%
Association, because
they have their three

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:10%
criteria for something
to be categorized

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:10%
as that, which is it's
chronic, it's progressive,

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:10%
and it's fatal.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And addiction absolutely
falls and has those three.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't get so
personally caught up

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
in the semantics of
the wording of it

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
because, at the end of the
day, I'm more concerned

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:84%
with whatever you call it,
it is capable of taking

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:84%
your life, my life, if we
are caught in that behavior.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are you afraid of that?

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Are you afraid of
death, of dying to this?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yes.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I'm
necessarily afraid of dying,

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
but of dying to
this, absolutely.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:90%
That would be--

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's the difference?

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.919 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: To me, if I
died from addiction rather

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
than natural death
or in an accident

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, it's just
tragic to me any time

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:90%
a life is lost to addiction.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of work
with people that I've--

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and I know a lot
of people that have

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
died to addiction or depression,
taking their own lives.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.860 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is so tragic
when it's unnecessary.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:10%
And the thing that's
alarming to me

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:10%
and disheartening is that,
at least in Connecticut,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:10%
and I think this is a pretty
universal thing in our country,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:10%
funding for programs for those
who struggle with addiction

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:10%
are constantly being cut.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are they?

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Jobs are being lost.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we're cutting
all of these resources

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
for people that need help, and
you look at the jail population

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's overflowing with
people that are there for drug

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and alcohol-related offenses.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So not only are we
doing a disservice

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to the well-being of people, but
now we have this prison issue.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, I don't
want to sidetrack,

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:84%
but that is also a big
controversial thing

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.782 align:middle line:84%
because there's
for-profit prisons

00:10:41.782 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and let's get more people in
there because it's more money.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a big issue.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's finally
in our awareness.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: It is.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's actually
some reforms reformed prisons

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
in California that I'm very
excited about that actually

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:84%
have treatment programs
and they've been converted,

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
which is fine.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a for-profit model still,
but it's helping people.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: It is.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we're going to
get into those signs, also,

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:90%
and what those solutions are.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But in the absence of
this funding and the cuts

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, do you
think that's what

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.076 align:middle line:84%
has caused this opioid epidemic
that we hear about so much?

00:11:14.076 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:90%
What's the reason for that?

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Yeah, I wouldn't
say that's what caused it,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.964 align:middle line:84%
but that is absolutely
a contributing factor.

00:11:18.964 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:84%
There is no doubt
about it because there

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of people in need
that aren't getting this help.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in the
treatment centers,

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.210 align:middle line:90%
you get help and hydration and--

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I tell people,
if you are, especially

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
for your first time, thinking
about going into this,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:84%
detox is something that can
be very beneficial for you.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone needs it.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I've met people that have
found their way through 12

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
steps or meditation and yoga,
and they weren't at the point

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
physically where their body
was so heavily dependent

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
on the substance that they
needed medical supervision

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:90%
in their detox experience.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.270 align:middle line:84%
For me, my two major
drugs of choice--

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm the kind
of person who'll

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:84%
take whatever just to get
me out of myself, but my two

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:84%
major ones are alcohol and
benzodiazepines, things

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:90%
like Xanax or Klonopin, Ativan.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
only two things

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:84%
you can actually die
from while withdrawing

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
because they can lead
to severe seizures

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately kill you.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Things like heroin or opioids,
you'll feel like you're dying,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:84%
but you can't actually
die from them.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
However, when you go in
and get medical attention,

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:84%
they can give you medication
that will help you and help

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:90%
the actual physical experience.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It's still not going
to be pleasant,

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
but it can certainly help,
and that gives people a better

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
chance at really
getting through it

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.100 align:middle line:90%
and then going into a program.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you do
need assistance

00:12:41.765 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:84%
when you're going through
something like that

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:90%
from a treatment center.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And I like how you say it is
not something to be afraid of.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not pretty, but it's
something that you really

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:90%
need to look into.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely, because
at the end of the day,

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
really when you're stuck
in that situation of being

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
in full-blown addiction,
you have two options,

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
use until you end up in a jail
cell, in an emergency room,

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:90%
or dead--

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:84%
really, that's kind of
your three options--

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
or make the decision, which
I'm not saying is easy,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:84%
but make that decision
that I don't want to end up

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
in those places, I don't have
to end up in those places,

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I can get help, I
need to get help.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you work with a
lot of the younger generation.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to
hear your perspective

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
on what systemically is going
on with the youth, Gen X, Z, Y,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
it, to what's missing and why

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:90%
the opioid availability.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So I know opioids
are very popular.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it is an
epidemic right now,

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:90%
especially with young people.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Well, going
back to big pharma,

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
they are prescribed so
freely and so easily

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying necessarily
to these younger individuals,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's very easy to go into
your parent's medicine cabinet,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:84%
or there are even places you can
order them online and have them

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:90%
shipped from other countries.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the streets and
buy them so easily and not just

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.390 align:middle line:90%
in cities.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's getting, I believe,
a lot more attention now

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:90%
because it has hit the suburbs.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that they
haven't been there.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's becoming much more
of an issue in suburbs.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it's been rampant in
inner cities for years and not

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:84%
just opioids, I mean,
anything from alcohol

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.090 align:middle line:90%
to crack and cocaine.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I should also note that
it's not just opioids that are

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:90%
being abused in suburbs--

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
alcohol, of course, and things
like crack, cocaine, PCP.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all being
abused, for sure,

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.480 align:middle line:90%
but opioids are the big one.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're also big because
they are such an easy killer.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Opioids often lead to
heroin in many, many cases

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:84%
because they get
expensive over time.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And as your addiction
grows, you need more

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to get that high that
you were getting before.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.312 align:middle line:84%
And it just wears your bank
account down so quickly

00:15:09.312 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
or, if you're younger,
your allowance, whatever

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:90%
the case may be.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're going from paying,
I mean, $100, $200 a day

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
to, oh, I can just get
these bundles of heroin,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.720 align:middle line:84%
which are a fraction of the
cost, yet are much more lethal.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
You get a bad bag or
you shoot too much

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.640 align:middle line:90%
and your life is over like that.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the tragic thing.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:84%
When I've been in
treatment programs,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it on a
couple of occasions,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
the clinicians-- and this
is such a good point.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
They ask that
people look around,

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's always an age range,
anywhere from teenagers

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:90%
to people in their 70s.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And they'll ask, who's
here for opioids?

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And typically, it's
the younger people.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they say,
who's here for alcohol?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's typically older people.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And the point they're
making is you rarely see

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
a person that's older
in treatment for opioids

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
because it is a very quick
killer, whereas alcohol

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is a much slower
progressive death.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:90%
It wears on your body.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:84%
It wears on every organ
you have over time,

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
unless you drink
and drive and get

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
into an accident where
that could take your life

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle line:90%
that quick.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.916 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're saying
that they're, first of all,

00:16:17.916 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
gateways, they're
gateway drugs into--

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
what do you feel about the
legalization of marijuana,

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:90%
speaking of gateway drugs?

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So-- and this is another
controversial one,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
especially for
someone in recovery.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider
marijuana a drug.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I think it is a plant medicine
when used in the right context.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
That said, I'm not here
saying go smoke pot,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
in recovery, because I

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:90%
have seen it take people out.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And while that might not
be their drug of choice,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:84%
they will engage in
marijuana for a while,

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and then it's not hitting
their pleasure center

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
in their brain the same
way their drug of choice

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is, so it's often
just a matter of time

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:84%
before they go back
to get that high,

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:84%
whether it is an opiate or
alcohol or whatever the case.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:10%
But I've also seen it have
positive effects on people.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:10%
And in some cases,
people with chronic pain,

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:10%
they've tried everything
and it doesn't work,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:10%
but marijuana really does
help, or cancer patients

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:10%
that have severe nausea issues.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It really helps.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:10%
And that leads into things
like ayahuasca, which I also

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:10%
don't have an issue
with when done

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:10%
in the right context, under
the right supervision,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:10%
with the right
settings and intention.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:10%
I've personally
never done ayahuasca,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:10%
so I can't say
anything pro or con,

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:10%
but I can say I have seen it
work wonders in some people's

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:10%
lives who've struggled
with depression,

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:10%
same with marijuana, but
I've also seen it lead people

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:10%
down a darker path too.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But as an
addictive personality,

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
you don't do it personally.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: I don't--
no, I don't do either.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:84%
The thing with ayahuasca,
it's not addictive whatsoever,

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.361 align:middle line:84%
or things like mushrooms
or psychedelics.

00:17:58.361 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So I know we're kind of
straying from marijuana.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:10%
But I have seen
people in treatment

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:10%
strictly for marijuana.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:10%
It might not have the
same physical effect when

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.210 align:middle line:10%
it comes to the
addictive nature,

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:10%
but mentally it absolutely
can be just as addicting

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:10%
for people, and it can lead
to actual mental issues.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I know someone from
the last treatment

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:84%
program I went in who
would hear voices,

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and otherwise he's a very
rational, sane, humorous

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But when he smokes to
the extent that he does--

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and he was prescribed it
for chronic pain to start,

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
but he began abusing it--

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
he had severe mental
reactions to it.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk
about early warning signs

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that we can tell our
loved ones or people

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:84%
that we're close to
are starting to head

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:90%
towards that place of addiction.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:90%
What do we look for?

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:90%
What do we say?

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Sure.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:10%
So-- I mean, the four
stages of addiction

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:10%
are experimentation,
regular use, abuse, and then

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:10%
you cross the line from
abuse to addiction.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And once you cross that line
from abuse to addiction,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
one in a million can go
back to safely using.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily
a throw all the red flags

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:84%
or it's a big warning sign
that my son or daughter

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
has smoked pot or tried pot.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Experimentation.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO:
Experimentation-- right.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
When it starts to head into
the regular use and then abuse,

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
that's where there's
really cause for alarm

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%
because they're starting
to rely on something

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.042 align:middle line:84%
in that regular
use or abuse phase

00:19:32.042 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to take them out of
what they're feeling.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:10%
Instead of feeling
their feelings

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:10%
and sitting with what
they're dealing with,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:10%
they're leaning on something
outside of themselves

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:10%
to help them.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to
say that it may not

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:84%
be prescribed in some
capacity to someone

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
or they might not be prescribed
something else to help with,

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's depression,
anxiety, or so on.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, they may need
to take something outside

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of themselves, even
if temporarily,

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to help balance their
physiology or their chemistry

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
in their bodies.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:90%
But so--

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is regular use
once a day, every weekend,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:90%
or what is regular?

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Different for--

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Different-- OK.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.328 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: --different people.

00:20:07.328 --> 00:20:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I would say if it's
more than two or three times

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
a week, you're not really
experimenting anymore.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Experimenting is experimenting.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about an
age, like an age range?

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you see 15-year-olds
that you would stop

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:90%
and say, don't start?

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.997 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Especially,
yes, if they have history

00:20:25.997 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
in their family of addiction
because they are more

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.125 align:middle line:90%
genetically prone to--

00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You think so?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Oh yeah.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's been shown.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm also fascinated
with what's called epigenetics.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And essentially that saying--

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
say someone has the capacity
to grow 6 feet tall.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
If they're not getting the
proper nutrition, drinking

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:84%
milk, or whatever
the case may be

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
to give their body the nutrients
it needs to reach 6 feet tall,

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:90%
then they're not going to.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So even though they have the
predisposition to be that tall

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they're
going to get that tall,

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and the same with addiction.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Just because the genetic
predisposition is

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
there doesn't mean that it's
going to necessarily happen.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:90%
But it does raise your chances.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you see someone
going down that pattern,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
what can you do to
help support them?

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:84%
What's the first
thing you can do?

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: So the first thing
is really, do they want help?

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.740 align:middle line:10%
So people can get very defensive
about that because maybe they

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:10%
don't think they have a problem,
and perhaps they don't yet.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:10%
So the approach I take,
because, as you said,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:10%
I do work with a lot of
people that are younger--

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:10%
so when I do these workshops
with younger people,

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:10%
I'm very real with them,
and I share my experience

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.112 align:middle line:10%
in a very transparent
way, and I let

00:21:39.112 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:10%
them know, look, I'm not
sharing any of this with you

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.634 align:middle line:10%
as a scare tactic.

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I went through the DARE program
when I was in high school,

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:90%
and to be honest, it was a joke.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It was people trying
to scare you into it,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't work,
at least for most people.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work for me.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So what I try to do is
share very honestly, look,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:90%
you're at such a young age.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot
of anywhere from 14

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:84%
to 20-year-olds,
male and females.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:10%
And if you're in treatment
at such a young age,

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:10%
then there is a
serious risk for you

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle line:10%
to potentially experience
some of the really dark places

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:10%
that I have gone to.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And so again, I don't share
them as a scare tactic.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I say, look, here is what
I've been through in my life.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:90%
I am very lucky to be alive.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.430 align:middle line:84%
The same can't be said for
so many people that I know.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
aren't much older

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
than the age of the
people I work with.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I've known a lot of
people in their 20s

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.669 align:middle line:84%
who have died to overdoses
or drunk driving accidents.

00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We see it all the time.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: All the time.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.207 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what tools
do you give them?

00:22:39.207 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: So it kind of depends.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.960 align:middle line:84%
When I go into these
groups or any workshops

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I do, I always start out by
asking people their name,

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:84%
where they're from, and just
a little bit about themselves,

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and that helps me
gauge the room.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't try to go
in with a set these

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
are the exact practices
I'm going to do,

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
because if I do
that, then I have

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.967 align:middle line:84%
more of a concrete
approach rather than fluid.

00:22:59.967 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You'll lose some people.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'd rather kind of
gauge the room first.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that way, I can meet
the people where they're at.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.305 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if I'm
in a room with anywhere

00:23:08.305 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
from a dozen to 100 people,
we're all in different places.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But still, it's easy to
find a middle ground.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the most basic is
just mindfulness of breath.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's very popular,
but it's popular for a reason.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It really-- it
helps bring us back.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
support groups?

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: For sure.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other
key is getting help,

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.800 align:middle line:84%
not going it alone, huge, which
was very, very difficult for me

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and still can be because
I'm actually introverted,

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
which I look at the line of
work I'm in, writing books,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.980 align:middle line:90%
public speaking--

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I can turn it on and go speak
in front of 1,000, 2,000 people,

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
but when I'm not working,
I need to retreat.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:90%
I need my solitude.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most
introverts can do that.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:90%
So I'm grateful for that.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But it is hard for me,
when I'm struggling,

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
to pick up the phone and reach
out to someone and be honest

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and like, hey, this is
what's going on today,

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.430 align:middle line:84%
calling my sponsor,
talking to my girlfriend,

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:84%
telling my parents, I'm
having a hard day today.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten much better at it.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But that is so huge, not going
it alone and actually talking,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.850 align:middle line:84%
just the act of talking
to someone you can trust,

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:90%
whether professional or not.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And I do definitely
encourage professional help,

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.672 align:middle line:84%
whether that's a therapist or a
program or treatment, whatever.

00:24:21.672 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:90%
It's different for all of us.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.370 align:middle line:90%
We all need different things.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But just the act of getting out
verbally what is inside of you,

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.070 align:middle line:84%
or if you can't muster up
the strength to do that,

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:90%
start writing.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But write honestly, and
don't write for anyone else

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:90%
to see it.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Write for yourself.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:90%
But write without any pretense.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Just get it all out on page.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.619 align:middle line:90%
No one's going to see it.

00:24:44.619 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Just write it, write it, write
it, just to get it out of you.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a very honest purging,
of sorts, when you do that.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.486 align:middle line:84%
It's not a cure all,
but it's a start.

00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't write every day.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:90%

>>GROSSO: I know.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I haven't written
since-- like, it's

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
been eight months, actually,
since I've written anything.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Since I finished that book,
I've been drained on writing.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.590 align:middle line:90%
But I do.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I talk every day to whether it's
my sponsor or my girlfriend.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm so blessed to have an
incredible girlfriend--

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Network.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:84%
we have these very just
honest conversations

is about this dopamine
receptor in the brain

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and how it just
loves that spike,

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and the brain looks for
things that give us newness

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:90%
or that feeling of a reward.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:90%
All brains need it.

>>GROSSO: They certainly do.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.240 align:middle line:90%

There are obviously healthier
addictions than non-healthy.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in
my own life, I've

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:90%
taken up exercising and running.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I love running,
hated it at first.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Now if I go more than a couple
days, I feel off centered.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:90%
So I love running.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.479 align:middle line:90%
I love exercising with weights.

00:26:15.479 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I love-- I mean, I've
always loved skateboarding.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:84%
But that's a healthy
release of dopamines.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.070 align:middle line:10%
Meditation can
certainly be that.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Prayer can certainly
be that, hiking--

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tattooing.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.506 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Tattoo-- certainly.

00:26:26.506 --> 00:26:27.306 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:26:27.306 --> 00:26:30.367 align:middle line:84%
No, really, it's part of my
own healing journey, for sure.

00:26:30.367 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, we all
have our own things.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:32.908 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What are these?

00:26:32.908 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Oh, I
mean, you're going

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.020 align:middle line:84%
to have to have me back
on for a whole other show.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
story here, right?

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: It is.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:90%
What I can tell you--

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.091 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: I mean, I
have a Kali right here.

00:26:41.091 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
She's from the Hindu
tradition, a very dear deity

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.947 align:middle line:90%
to me, just kind of a fierce.

00:26:48.947 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:90%
That's why I got her on my knee.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.584 align:middle line:84%
She's very fierce, but
a real incredible--

00:26:52.584 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You also
have "hope" here.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Show this to the camera.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.463 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the first
tattoos I got, actually,

00:26:57.463 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:84%
when I got out of treatment--
"love and kindness"

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.580 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
very big practice I

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
use and a great reminder, "love
more" on the inside of my hands

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:90%
because I look there a lot.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh wow.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.175 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Just remind
myself love more,

00:27:07.175 --> 00:27:09.570 align:middle line:84%
love myself more,
love others more.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: "IMA"?

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: In my heart forever.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh nice.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: "Bookworm"--
because I'm a big reader.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You got a
whole thing going on.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah, a whole thing.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you this--

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Then this is the lotus.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: I just got
this, like, a week ago.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a rose.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And these I just got because
I like the aesthetic of them

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and because my neck's
about the only place I

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:84%
have left that's not tattooed,
that and the back of my legs.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I'm not doing the
top of my head or my face.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.280 align:middle line:90%
So this was my last one.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But this is somewhere where you
use your creative expression.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.474 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: It absolutely is.

00:27:38.474 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see, it
became very addictive for me.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to a lot
of people with tattoos

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.970 align:middle line:84%
who have no
substance-related issues,

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.344 align:middle line:84%
but nine times out of
10, the first thing

00:27:48.344 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:84%
they say, even if they don't
know I'm in recovery, is it's

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:90%
so addicting, right?

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, duh, yeah.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing I did want
to say to that, though, is also

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:84%
to be careful with the healthier
addictions or dopamine releases

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
because I have caught myself
very much using practices

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
like meditation or running
as a means of aversion,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
just like I would
use substances.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I would sit on my
cushion because I

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:84%
knew, having meditated for over
15 years, more times than not,

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.990 align:middle line:84%
after I do some
mindful breathing,

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I get anchored
into a space where

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.900 align:middle line:84%
it is a kind of
transcendent experience,

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to take me
out of uncomfortable feelings

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:90%
in the moment.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Or running-- I hit that 5-mile
mark and run 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
7 more miles, it's going to
give me that runner's high

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and get me out of a low, and
not that that's a bad thing,

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:84%
but when you do it excessively
and as a means for aversion,

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily
healthier, definitely

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.789 align:middle line:84%
a better option than
picking up a bottle

00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:49.080 align:middle line:84%
or putting powder up your
nose or a needle in your arm,

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's just something to
be aware of because they can

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:90%
absolutely be addictions too.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've injured my
ankle from running

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.610 align:middle line:84%
way too much or meditation, I've
never really injured myself,

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.937 align:middle line:84%
but, again, I recognize
that you can overdo it.

00:29:01.937 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, all right,
so let's talk about this.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:90%
You are a realist.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And things are
going to happen again.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And bad stuff is
going to happen again.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's going
to happen to you,

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
happen to the world,

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
be devastating.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.334 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely.

00:29:15.334 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are
you going to do?

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Personally, my best
defense against a relapse

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and going back to that,
what can I do for myself,

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.330 align:middle line:84%
is working a strong
program in my life.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.560 align:middle line:90%
They call it a program.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can call
it whatever you want,

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.680 align:middle line:84%
but just for lack of
better terminology.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm talking about,
like, if there is an earthquake

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and you lose your house or you
lose your whatever, I mean,

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:84%
when it gets really bad, is a
program really going to work?

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: If you're working
a strong one, absolutely.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I have gone through hardships
in my life without relapsing.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I have known people who
have lost loved ones, who

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.510 align:middle line:84%
have gone through divorce, who
have gone through this or that

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.620 align:middle line:90%
and have not picked up.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Death-- yeah.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely--
because they

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.307 align:middle line:90%
are working a strong program.

00:29:59.307 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
strong program-- and this

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
is suitable for someone
who's not necessarily

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
in recovery from substances,
but just living an integrally

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:90%
healthy lifestyle.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:90%
That can help us.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't just do it to
feel good in the moment

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:90%
or feel good for the day.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:84%
We do it so that we are ready
for those things, as well.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:84%
But if we're
speaking specifically

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.220 align:middle line:84%
to substance-related
issues, they

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
have what's called a
Swiss cheese model.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.610 align:middle line:90%
And I love this.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Essentially what it's saying
is each layer of Swiss cheese--

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:90%
so say here is the relapse.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Each layer of Swiss cheese
is part of your program.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So one layer might be
attending meetings,

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
one layer might be exercise,
one layer might be meditation,

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:46.610 align:middle line:84%
one layer might be yoga, on and
on and on, hiking, whatever.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So each layer, like a piece of
Swiss cheese, has a hole in it.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So things in life can get
through a hole in one layer,

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.657 align:middle line:84%
but maybe it'll hit that
second layer and stop it,

00:30:56.657 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
or maybe the holes are lined up
so it gets through two layers,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
but then the third
layer stops it.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: So yeah.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's really, though--

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I love that kind of
metaphor for a program.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, so the more things
you have set up in place,

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:84%
it puts you farther
away from a relapse,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.320 align:middle line:84%
or if we're not speaking to
addiction and substances,

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.380 align:middle line:84%
it puts you farther away from
engaging in any potential

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:84%
self-defeating behavior, whether
that's engaging in risky sex

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:90%
or overeating--

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or gaming.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Exactly--
anything that is, again,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:90%
just a means of numbing out.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And the one caveat
I do want to make

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:84%
that I think is so
important is that there

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:36.620 align:middle line:84%
are some things in life that
are so painful in the moment.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't suggest
leaning into it.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I know we are taught in
the spiritual community

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:90%
to feel your feelings.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Yes, of course,
feel your feelings.

Lean into it as much as you can.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you have just experienced
a tragic loss or an earthquake

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:84%

it as much as you can.

much in that moment,

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:84%
turn up music really
loud, watch a comedy.

Yes, it's OK.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Don't pick up a bottle

Don't go back to drugs.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.050 align:middle line:84%

to give yourself

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
a little space from
that pain in the moment

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.027 align:middle line:84%

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.610 align:middle line:84%
what I can say honestly

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I have a desire, a stronger
desire than probably anything

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:84%
else in my life to never
pick up a substance again.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But knowing the illness,
the disease, the allergy,

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.280 align:middle line:84%

Relapse is always a potential.

>>GROSSO: Oh yeah, that

>>GROSSO: First and
foremost, sobriety,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:84%
100, because without

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:90%
have anything else, period.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.880 align:middle line:84%

well-being, setting boundaries

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:90%

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Has to be.

Without that, I don't
have my girlfriend,

I don't have my family, I am
not able to show up and help

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.890 align:middle line:84%
other people because
I am not well.

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:90%
So without it, I have nothing.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So your
girlfriend and your family

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and your helping of others

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:90%

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Oh, huge.

00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:23.219 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but that has
to come second.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:90%
And I know that sounds--

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.088 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: I don't want
to say irrational.

00:34:28.088 --> 00:34:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It might not-- people that have
not struggled with addiction

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.280 align:middle line:90%
might not understand that.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.699 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say
that without my sobriety,

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:84%
without taking that more serious
than anything in my life,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I really set up the possibility
of losing anything else.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you said to me
you hope you don't relapse.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:90%
I hope I don't.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you said, just
now, the most important thing

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.230 align:middle line:90%
in your life is sobriety.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yes.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.304 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't understand.

00:34:54.304 --> 00:34:56.179 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: The most
important thing in my life

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:90%
has been sobriety.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But even though it's the
most important thing,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that I don't,
whether it's conscious or not,

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:06.410 align:middle line:84%
stop working a strong
program, starting to pull back

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.930 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, getting very
busy, like I said earlier,

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.580 align:middle line:90%
not calling my sponsor.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that I'm
intentionally setting myself up

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.140 align:middle line:90%
to relapse again--

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's the key.

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yes.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But things start
to happen where,

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.640 align:middle line:84%
again, that voice in my
head says, it's all right

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.290 align:middle line:90%
if you miss this or that.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And there will be
circumstances in life

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.970 align:middle line:84%
where I might not be able
to hit as many meetings one

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.100 align:middle line:84%
week because of my travel
schedule or whatnot.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.830 align:middle line:84%
But as long as I'm
not BSing myself

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and that becomes a pattern over
a prolonged period of time,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.300 align:middle line:84%
whereas that's what ends
up leading to a relapse

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.430 align:middle line:84%
or becomes the
preliminary relapse.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have
this great intention.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking,
also, to people

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.670 align:middle line:84%
who have suicidal
tendencies, because sometimes

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:55.630 align:middle line:84%
a relapse or an overdose
is a form of suicide.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: My sponsor would say,
and I agree, for the alcoholic,

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:02.742 align:middle line:84%
even picking up a drink for a
relapse is a form of suicide.

00:36:02.742 --> 00:36:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's speak
about that for a sec.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you have this big,
huge desire to have sobriety

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and if that's your biggest
and most important focus

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and there are things that
will pull you off that track

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.390 align:middle line:84%
by getting busy and things
that just sneak up or crises

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that
happen in your life,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:84%
how do you keep that
your biggest why?

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.600 align:middle line:90%
How do you stay there?

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Also with people
with suicide, how

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:84%
do they keep their
child their biggest why

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
or their reason for
living their biggest why?

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And at what point is it
the disease that comes in?

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.170 align:middle line:84%
This is not to be answered,
maybe, at this moment.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:47.216 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Well, I can
give you a picture of it

00:36:47.216 --> 00:36:49.090 align:middle line:84%
because you're speaking
to the disease aspect

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:84%
or where does that
come into play,

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is where, for those
who have not experienced it,

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.830 align:middle line:84%
it seems like it is
completely insane, which

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.110 align:middle line:90%
it is absolutely insane.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what I wanted
to unpack from you, that.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you just a very
user friendly, very condensed

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:84%
overview of what
happens in our brain,

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:84%
because that's essentially
what triggers all of it.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So once we actually
pick up the substance

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and put the substance
in our body, we have--

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.590 align:middle line:84%
first of all, I'm
fast forwarding.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:15.590 align:middle line:90%
So let me tell you this.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.290 align:middle line:84%
We have what's called
a triune brain.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We actually have three
brains in our head.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:84%
We have the frontal
cortex, which

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.090 align:middle line:84%
is the house of our conscious
thinking, our rational mind,

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and that's where we
live most of our days

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.470 align:middle line:84%
thinking this is not good
for me, this is good for me,

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.700 align:middle line:90%
so on and so forth.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.640 align:middle line:84%
We have our midbrain, which
controls our emotions.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we have,
back here in our neck,

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:84%
it's our limbic-- or not limbic,
excuse me-- our reptilian

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.340 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is associated with
fight or flight, our survival,

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of,
also, our caveman brain.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's really like it's in that
hunter-gatherer survival mode.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.270 align:middle line:84%
When an addict or alcoholic has
these substances in their body,

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:84%
they are functioning from
their reptilian brain,

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.697 align:middle line:84%
and that's why people,
as insane as it

00:37:59.697 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
looks and for those who
have never experienced it,

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:90%
don't understand.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand why
they don't understand,

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.380 align:middle line:90%
because it is so insane.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But it is-- literally for us,
when we're caught in the grips

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:84%
of it, that is associated
with survival--

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.200 align:middle line:84%
drinking when you are actively
caught in that relapse

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:84%
or even if you've
never gotten sober.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.450 align:middle line:84%
For any addict
alcoholic, we are then

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:84%
coming not from our
conscious brain where

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.400 align:middle line:84%
right now you and I are having
this conversation that's

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.490 align:middle line:84%
rational, but if I
had been drinking,

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I would not be in
a rational state.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:34.531 align:middle line:84%
I would be-- though I might
still have the idea, like, yes,

00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:90%
this is not good for me.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't be doing this.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It is far overpowered
by my emotional midbrain

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:90%
and my reptilian brain.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They are way stronger at that
point than my rational thought.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So I can tell myself, god,
I don't want to do this.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you how
many times I have literally

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:84%
cried looking at a bottle in
my hand or a line of cocaine

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:56.270 align:middle line:84%
on the table, cried because
I did not want to do it.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But it was so beyond my
control because I was already

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.760 align:middle line:90%
caught in it.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I literally did not have
the physical capability

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:90%
to stop myself.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: And that's
why people end up dying.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:07.720 align:middle line:90%
They chase it into the grave.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So say you find
somebody in that position

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:14.239 align:middle line:84%
and you catch them in the
grips of it, what do you do?

00:39:14.239 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: That's the hard part.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.852 align:middle line:84%
And that's where people
say, as you said earlier,

00:39:17.852 --> 00:39:22.010 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people let their
loved ones bottom out.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:24.700 align:middle line:84%
The one inspiring thing is that
a bottom does not necessarily

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.440 align:middle line:84%
mean you have to
lose everything.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.910 align:middle line:90%
It can be an emotional bottom.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It can be a wow, I can't believe
I did this, I need to get help.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.430 align:middle line:84%
I know someone that had
an issue with alcohol.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:37.490 align:middle line:84%
He yelled at a friend and he
kind of lost that friendship

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:38.290 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:84%
That was enough for him
to get sober and really

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:90%
take it seriously.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:45.760 align:middle line:10%
So the very difficult
thing is that, really,

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.910 align:middle line:10%
the person that is in
the addictive state

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:49.840 align:middle line:10%
needs to want it.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
a lot of times

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:84%
it does take them
bottoming out, but, again,

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.640 align:middle line:84%
being very clear that the bottom
is different for everyone.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:03.100 align:middle line:84%
A loved one cannot force the
person that is struggling with

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:07.480 align:middle line:84%
addiction into treatment unless
they have them committed.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But aside from that,
you can love them,

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:13.880 align:middle line:84%
you can try to coerce
them, but really

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.130 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to do anything.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Until that person is ready to
get help first and foremost

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, they're not
really going to get better.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:90%
They need to want it.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
disheartening thing.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the question I least like
being asked by loved ones, not

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
in an interview, but when the
family members say, what can I

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:30.900 align:middle line:90%
do?

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm so scared I'm
going to lose them.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It breaks my heart
because I know

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.450 align:middle line:84%
so many parents that
have lost loved ones

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.260 align:middle line:90%
so earlier, such a young age.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Parents should not
outlive their children,

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:84%
especially when it comes
to addiction or depression

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:46.420 align:middle line:90%
and suicide.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's just gutting to me.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you go
to a concert or an event

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and you see people using,
do you say anything?

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: No.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not my place.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's a
friend and I see that--

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I know that they
know me well enough

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:84%
to know I wouldn't be imposing
my judgments or moral values

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I might say, hey, have you
ever thought you have an issue,

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.260 align:middle line:90%
in a not--

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.640 align:middle line:90%
finger pointing never helps.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.540 align:middle line:90%
You have a problem.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.420 align:middle line:84%
That just will shut
someone off automatically.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.690 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't do anything.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So I might say to somebody,
have you ever thought about it?

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.517 align:middle line:84%
But more times than not,
friends will approach me

00:41:23.517 --> 00:41:24.850 align:middle line:90%
because they know my experience.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And hey, I think I
might have a problem.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:28.010 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, maybe
they do, maybe they don't.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'll talk to them about it.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, the
more exposure you have

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.561 align:middle line:84%
and the books that you
write and the places

00:41:34.561 --> 00:41:37.420 align:middle line:84%
that you go talk, you
provide a space for people

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:84%
to have this conversation, which
I think is very cool of you.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Thanks.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very cool.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Well,
yeah, and that's why

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.280 align:middle line:90%
I try to take that approach.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it really does allow
for other people to feel--

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.194 align:middle line:84%
just it's easier
for them to open up,

00:41:51.194 --> 00:41:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and they feel like, all
right, this guy, he gets it.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.046 align:middle line:90%
He's not judging me.

00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:56.170 align:middle line:90%
I can talk to him about it.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And you're not on a pulpit
saying, you should not do this.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: No, not at all.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're transparent
and you're real.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:01.951 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: I'm right here.

00:42:01.951 --> 00:42:03.130 align:middle line:90%
There is no pedestal.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.860 align:middle line:90%
It's right here with whomever.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:90%
always.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.285 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you also
have these moments

00:42:07.285 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:90%
of beautiful enlightenment.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a clip here
of you talking about one

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:11.920 align:middle line:90%
of these moments.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.757 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:42:12.757 --> 00:42:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: It's one of
those experiences that

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:90%
is just so hard to describe.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.009 align:middle line:90%
But as I'm running, it was--

00:42:20.009 --> 00:42:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I guess, I think,
I wrote in the book

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that it was an experience of
non-experience is the closest I

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:26.310 align:middle line:90%
can come to describing it.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:30.360 align:middle line:84%
There was an awareness, but it
was as if everything exploded

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.530 align:middle line:90%
and imploded at the same time.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was just--

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:38.540 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] I'm laughing
because as I'm going,

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I become aware that there's some
tears streaming down my face,

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:90%
and that's all I'm aware of.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:46.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't feel my feet anymore.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.290 align:middle line:90%
I can't feel my legs.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:51.080 align:middle line:84%
But I'm aware of
these gentle tears.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And the experience lasted
probably only a minute or so

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.720 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as I
became aware of that,

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I realized how
ridiculously insane

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:02.501 align:middle line:84%
I must have looked
to drivers ongoing.

00:43:02.501 --> 00:43:05.000 align:middle line:84%
There's this dude jogging down
the street, tears coming down

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:05.830 align:middle line:90%
his eyes.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.205 align:middle line:10%
But it was just one of those
really beautiful experiences

00:43:08.205 --> 00:43:11.820 align:middle line:10%
that really it defies
putting into words,

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.510 align:middle line:10%
yet, sure, I was a glutton for
punishment and tried to do it.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.310 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that enlightenment?

00:43:16.351 --> 00:43:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you experienced a
little taste of enlightenment

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:20.266 align:middle line:90%
in that moment?

00:43:20.266 --> 00:43:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Enlightenment's
a funny word.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.510 align:middle line:90%
But I would say so.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:84%
The way-- I think
Sharon Salzberg had

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:28.160 align:middle line:90%
a great take on enlightenment.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And she said, when
you're meditating,

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.000 align:middle line:84%
it's not the moments
where you're clear minded.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, that is part of it.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's those little
moments when you remember

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.770 align:middle line:90%
you're lost in thought.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Those are little gaps
of enlightenment.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.130 align:middle line:90%
And I love when she said that.

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.722 align:middle line:10%
You're there in the
moment, you come back,

00:43:45.722 --> 00:43:47.930 align:middle line:10%
maybe it's for a few seconds,
few minutes, who knows,

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.480 align:middle line:10%
but you come back, and
those are little glimpses

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.800 align:middle line:10%
of enlightenment.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I like this story
because it's really--

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:58.430 align:middle line:84%
not to insult any
joggers in the audience,

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.295 align:middle line:84%
but it is a relatively
mundane activity.

00:44:00.295 --> 00:44:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Absolutely.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And you weren't in
the Himalayas and you

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.590 align:middle line:90%
weren't at the guru's feet.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:90%
You were just jogging.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this expansion happened.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Was there a part of you, after
you came back to yourself,

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:17.907 align:middle line:84%
did you wonder if
you were going crazy?

00:44:17.907 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Not in
that one because I've

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.710 align:middle line:84%
had these experiences
before, as many

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
of us in this room
probably have.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.170 align:middle line:90%
For me, I feel it in the heart.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.815 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, has
always been the true guide.

00:44:29.815 --> 00:44:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
to sound cliche.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the most honest
way I can describe it.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.070 align:middle line:90%
It's something I feel.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:38.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a connectedness,
like you said,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:90%
of all things at all times.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It is this direct living
experience in the moment,

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and it is pure and,
god, beautiful.

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, words really
fail to describe this,

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and I am no Ram Dass
when it comes to trying

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.700 align:middle line:90%
to describe these things.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you obviously have
made peace with your shadow

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and you integrate
it into your life.

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us
maybe an exercise

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:09.140 align:middle line:84%
that you teach your students
on how to embrace that shadow?

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.089 align:middle line:84%
There's a really
super easy practice,

00:45:12.089 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and I've got to give
credit where it's due.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.485 align:middle line:84%
I learned it from the
wonderful JP Sears.

00:45:16.485 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:10%
Many of your viewers
probably know him,

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.340 align:middle line:10%
the ultra spiritual comedian.

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.140 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: He's great.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GROSSO: I met him
several years ago.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:24.668 align:middle line:10%
We were teaching a workshop
in Mexico together,

00:45:24.668 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:10%
our first time teaching
together and we just

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.830 align:middle line:10%
hit it off immediately.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Love him to death.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He's hilarious.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: So funny.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.966 align:middle line:84%
But the funny thing is,
people don't know about him,

00:45:32.966 --> 00:45:35.090 align:middle line:84%
he is just one of the most
intelligent, seriously

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:36.964 align:middle line:84%
brilliant, compassionate
people in the world.

00:45:36.964 --> 00:45:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So aside from his
humor, he's amazing.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But so he taught this practice
because he is very well trained

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:45.420 align:middle line:90%
in these sorts of topics.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.279 align:middle line:84%
And I've since used
it quite frequently.

00:45:48.279 --> 00:45:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I teach it a lot,
and I just love it.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So all that said, the
practice-- so simple.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Any time we are aware
of an emotional response

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:84%
to something outside
of ourselves,

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:02.330 align:middle line:84%
not just bad or negative,
but good or positive,

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:07.310 align:middle line:84%
so either side, look
at that and go inside.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.627 align:middle line:84%
What is that saying
about ourselves?

00:46:09.627 --> 00:46:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Because-- so any time we're
having an emotional response

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.825 align:middle line:84%
to something outside-- and not
just a person, but a movie,

00:46:14.825 --> 00:46:18.440 align:middle line:84%
a music, the surroundings,
whatever the case may be--

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:84%
it's always a projection of
something inside of ourselves.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's been wonderful for
me, going inside and getting--

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.740 align:middle line:84%
because our shadow
is essentially

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.192 align:middle line:90%
just the unconscious.

00:46:29.192 --> 00:46:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we hear
the word "shadow,"

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:34.640 align:middle line:84%
it's often equated with
darkness, bad negativity.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And sure, that's part of it.

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's the unconscious,
and the unconscious

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.280 align:middle line:90%
is not just all bad.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.160 align:middle line:90%
It's the unconscious.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It's whatever it is.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we have
that experience

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.410 align:middle line:84%
of an emotional reaction
to something, flip it.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Instead of making it about
what's outside of us,

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:54.810 align:middle line:84%
what's it actually saying about
inside of us, or us, ourselves?

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So for an example, myself,
I would catch myself often

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.070 align:middle line:84%
walking in public, didn't
matter where it was,

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.752 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a man
with a nice haircut.

00:47:03.752 --> 00:47:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind,
I'd be like, oh, he

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:06.730 align:middle line:90%
looks like a dummy, whatever.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably say something
not appropriate for the show.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:10.859 align:middle line:90%
But I have my--

00:47:10.859 --> 00:47:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You've done good today.

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: --opinions
and judgements.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good job.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Thank you.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm aware.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:16.295 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Family programming.

00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Mindfulness.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But so anyways-- so I'll
be like, whoa, why--

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.310 align:middle line:90%
this stranger.

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Why are you having this
emotional reaction?

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:27.272 align:middle line:84%
And I'll go inside and I'll
realize, wow, you know what?

00:47:27.272 --> 00:47:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It's because you started
balding when you were, like,

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.910 align:middle line:84%
18 or 20 years old, and
you can't grow hair,

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:34.730 align:middle line:84%
you shave your head,
or you wear hats a lot.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:35.570 align:middle line:90%
That's about me.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really
about that person.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Or if I see someone
wearing a band t-shirt,

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like that is
because I can relate.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.140 align:middle line:90%
I resonate with that.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's never really about them.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.130 align:middle line:90%
It's about me.

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So those are just
basic examples,

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.560 align:middle line:90%
but it's literally anything.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.412 align:middle line:84%
Any time we have a
reaction to anything,

00:47:56.412 --> 00:47:58.620 align:middle line:84%
instead of making it about
what's outside of us, what

00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.904 align:middle line:90%
is that saying about you?

00:47:59.904 --> 00:48:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
judge yourself,

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.370 align:middle line:84%
because, no, no, that's
defeating the purpose.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the
projection that you're

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:04.450 align:middle line:90%
putting onto the person.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Exactly.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And that just gets us so much
more in touch with ourselves,

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:08.800 align:middle line:90%
and it's so simple.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: We can use
it anytime, anywhere,

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and it really helps connect
us with our unconscious

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and get to know ourselves
at a deeper level.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.880 align:middle line:90%
How simple is that?

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that is something
I will absolutely take away.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:20.430 align:middle line:90%
I hope you do.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: I love that.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You've met a lot of
great spiritual teachers.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: I've been fortunate.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you Ram Dass?

00:48:27.275 --> 00:48:28.650 align:middle line:10%
>>GROSSO: The way
I got connected

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:30.822 align:middle line:10%
with him was I wanted
to do an interview when

00:48:30.822 --> 00:48:33.030 align:middle line:10%
one of his more recent books,
"Polishing the Mirror,"

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.990 align:middle line:10%
came out.

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:36.420 align:middle line:10%
So I contacted the Love
Serve Remember Foundation.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:39.660 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to do an interview
with him for that book release.

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.450 align:middle line:10%
And Raghu Markus, who
heads that foundation--

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.570 align:middle line:10%
he's the executive director--

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.580 align:middle line:10%
got back to me and was like,
sure, we can set this up.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.860 align:middle line:84%
He's available for
Skype on this day.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.270 align:middle line:10%
And I remember-- and I don't
want to over romanticize it,

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.070 align:middle line:10%
but I literally--

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:56.430 align:middle line:10%
I had a tear come down my
eye because he and Ken Wilber

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.680 align:middle line:10%
have been the two current
teachers that have

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.690 align:middle line:10%
been so influential in my life.

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:10%
There have been many others that
I owe a huge debt of gratitude

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:10%
to, both living and
long since passed.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:10.500 align:middle line:84%
But contemporary speaking,
they have been two huge ones.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've been so fortunate
to meet both of them

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and teach alongside, and it's
just a very surreal experience.

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So with Ram Dass, we had
that Skype interview,

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and then it wasn't that
long after he wrote--

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:26.070 align:middle line:84%
or actually, after that, he
knew I had my first book,

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.960 align:middle line:84%
"Indie Spiritualist"
coming out and he

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:31.380 align:middle line:84%
offered to give it an
endorsement without me asking.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And I will never forget
how surreal that was.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:36.469 align:middle line:90%
And I have it on camera.

00:49:36.469 --> 00:49:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I think I put it on
YouTube because I

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.606 align:middle line:90%
started to tear up again.

00:49:39.606 --> 00:49:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said to
me, and that's not

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.540 align:middle line:84%
from me, that's
from the big guy,

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:47.460 align:middle line:84%
meaning Maharajji, his guru,
and since my guru, as well.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So that led to Raghu Markus
who was then creating,

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.760 align:middle line:84%
shortly thereafter,
a podcast network

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.070 align:middle line:90%
called the Be Here Now Network.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.750 align:middle line:84%
He invited me to start
hosting a podcast with them,

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.570 align:middle line:84%
which, again, it
was like, really?

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Twist my arm, you know?

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're really amazing.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really have gotten
into some incredible places

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.700 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to just show
this quick clip

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.860 align:middle line:90%
with Ram Dass and Chris Grosso.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSO: Well, is there
anything, being the old dog

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:21.060 align:middle line:84%
that you are, would
say to the younger

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.910 align:middle line:84%
generation of spiritual
seekers that are coming up?

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Is there any specific
message or words

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.900 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom that you
would impart on them?

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>RAM DASS: This culture is
intrigued with iPhone and such.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.360 align:middle line:10%
And they have to look within.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.820 align:middle line:10%
And it is hard to
look within when

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:54.450 align:middle line:10%
the pizzazz of the culture--

00:50:54.450 --> 00:51:03.900 align:middle line:10%
and it's tough to be a
young person in our culture

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.610 align:middle line:10%
because they get pulled
outward, because things

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:17.220 align:middle line:10%
are available for them,
available communication, sex,

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:26.760 align:middle line:10%
drugs, unless they
use their awareness

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:36.490 align:middle line:10%
to go into find their
inner guru, inner guru,

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:40.250 align:middle line:10%
they're not going to be
as true spiritual self.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:46.360 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I like to wrap up
every show with asking you

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.570 align:middle line:90%
your biggest why.

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And we touched on it
a little bit before,

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.640 align:middle line:90%
but I think there's more.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Yeah.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's--

00:51:57.790 --> 00:51:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Wish I thought of
that one myself.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.370 align:middle line:10%
My biggest why,
I would say, is--

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:07.120 align:middle line:10%
you're right, we did
start to touch on it.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.460 align:middle line:10%
I think it's because
there is so much--

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:14.380 align:middle line:10%
and the keyword here is
unnecessary pain and suffering

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.780 align:middle line:10%
and death in this world.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:17.990 align:middle line:90%
That is my biggest why.

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say unnecessary
is because pain and suffering,

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.600 align:middle line:84%
to the extent most of us
experience it, a lot of it

00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.280 align:middle line:90%
is unnecessary.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Death, often, it's unavoidable,
but I believe it's unnecessary.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:35.440 align:middle line:84%
It comes before its time
in a lot of people's lives.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And that does go back to
the behaviors we engage in.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And my line of work has
led me predominantly

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:45.300 align:middle line:84%
into substance related,
which we've discussed

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.910 align:middle line:90%
at length in this conversation.

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for such an
engaging topic and the breadth

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.790 align:middle line:90%
of your questions.

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:53.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's what fuels me.

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:55.960 align:middle line:90%
I am so lucky to be alive.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.860 align:middle line:84%
That experience I described
to you with being intubated

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.530 align:middle line:84%
was just one of many
times I could have died.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I used to say I
should have died.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But no, I'm still here
today, so I could have died.

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very lucky
to be here, and I

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:12.610 align:middle line:84%
know a lot of people that
are not that fortunate who

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:13.649 align:middle line:90%
have lost their lives.

00:53:13.649 --> 00:53:15.190 align:middle line:10%
And I know a lot of
people even right

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:19.390 align:middle line:10%
now that are suffering to an
extent that is not necessary

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:22.750 align:middle line:10%
if they were willing to just
find that strength to reach out

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:25.690 align:middle line:10%
for help, to ask for help, to--

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:10%
I know it's uncomfortable
to make that decision,

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:33.250 align:middle line:10%
but really look at the
options-- continue in this just

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.890 align:middle line:10%
awful experience of being
caught with addiction

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:40.240 align:middle line:10%
or stuck in depression
or cultivate the bravery

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.396 align:middle line:10%
to ask for help.

00:53:41.396 --> 00:53:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you for that.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Your desire for the end of
suffering, needless suffering,

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and for your solutions
and offering people

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.560 align:middle line:84%
the extension of your
wisdom is a wonderful why.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSO: Thank you, Lisa.

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Appreciate it so much.

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:56.990 align:middle line:90%
