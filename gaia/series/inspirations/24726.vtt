00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me and the Gaiam

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:90%
studios in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Regina Meredith.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered why
some people appear to be hard

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:84%
wired to handle the
challenges of life

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:84%
while others completely
break down and freak out?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
According to today's
guest, Joan Borysenko,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
we all have the ability to find
resilience in changing times.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a better
understanding of the tools that

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:90%
are required to bounce back.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
In her book, "It's Not
The End Of The World",

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Joan says it all.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And we have her here today.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know this may embarrass
you, but I was so impressed,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I had to bring it up.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Wayne Dyer says you're the
smartest woman he's ever met.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I know this probably
isn't the first time

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that's been tossed back at you.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, if
she's that smart,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:90%
we have to talk to this woman.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness, I love Wayne.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, clearly, he loves you.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we're friends
for a long time.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just wanted to
honor that little love fest.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
But as we jump into
this conversation,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
first of all, here you
all, you're put together.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:90%
You've done a lot of media.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:90%
You're poised and confident.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how
you started out.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
In your early years, you
had a lot of challenges.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And you were not
particularly resilient.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you could tell us
what happened, in particular

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
maybe even speaking
of your father,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and I know that's a
very touching subject.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were
two main things.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience
as a 10-year-old

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:90%
with a minor stress.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
We moved.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like we moved
from Boston to Kansas.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.131 align:middle line:10%
We moved 10 minutes
down the road.

00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:10%
That was it.
But it was another school zone.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:10%
And my response to that
was really quite terrible.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:10%
I developed obsessive
compulsive disorder.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And I started to hallucinate
really frightening

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
things, head hunters,
snakes, scorpions,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:90%
from a movie I'd seen.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
Until I literally could
not tell the hallucinations

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:90%
from reality.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And then came the symptoms
like having to take a glass

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and turn it a certain number
of times in each direction

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:90%
before you take a drink.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Truly obsessive compulsive.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
rituals like that.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:84%
All my reading had to
be done upside down,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.830 align:middle line:84%
backwards and
repeated three times.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Makes it kind of hard
to read anything.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Where did you pick up that one?

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:90%
You know it just-- they come.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Why do people with that
syndrome almost all have

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:90%
the hand washing obsession.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
In any case, it got me very
interested in brain science.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But I recovered
through what we would

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:90%
call a spontaneous remission.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
But you know if you ask
anybody who ever had

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
a spontaneous remission
from anything, Regina,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
they all have some
interesting story.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And it involves a complete
change of consciousness

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly looking at
things with new eyes.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I sat down after about
six months of this,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:90%
and I said, I better pray.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:90%
I was not a prayerful kid.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:90%
My family didn't pray.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But you know when you're
in a situation like that,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:84%
there's some natural movement
to say, well, if there's

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
any help out there, help.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Was it a problem for you?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean were you feeling
that this was something

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.245 align:middle line:90%
that needed to be corrected?

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Or not just your
family, you actually

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:90%
felt the pain of your disorder.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I lived in a state
of constant terror.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Because my fear was if I was
interrupted during a ritual,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
these nightmare horrors
that I was hallucinating

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
would come to life
in the living room

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and kill my parents
and my brother.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was a state of
perpetual terror day

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and night without
any letup whatsoever.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
help from psychiatry.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
My parents tried, but
this was over 50 years ago

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:90%
when I was 10.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
There was no Clonopin, no
Prozac, no behavior therapy.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:90%
Really nothing.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%
So I sat to pray.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had what I had
no context for, which

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:90%
was a spiritual experience.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:90%
The intense fear dissipated.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I felt a
connection to something

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:84%
much larger that was
totally safe, completely

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:90%
loving, and all wise.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- I mean when
you've been terrified,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I can't even begin to
express what that's like.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had a knowing in this
state that I could recover

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and a download about
how to go about it.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And within three days, the
entire episode was finished.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:90%
What a gift.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And well, it was a gift.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I think for
many people, the darkest hour

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
of your life, and the
most terrible thing

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:84%
that you could go through
turns out later to be a gift.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's all part of really
like the hero's journey.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
You have something that
completely separates you

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:90%
from reality as you know it.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Trauma.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Trauma.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And then you're free.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
You open up at another level if
you've got some good guidance

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
particularly.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And that got me
interested in resilience.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And certainly I didn't
know that word at 10.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But it got me interested in
understanding brain science.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
How could you be normal
one minute, completely

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:84%
in an altered reality,
a terrible one,

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and then a few days later,
come back to normal reality?

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it got me interested
in the spiritual journey.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Because although I had no
context for an experience

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
like that of really
cosmic consciousness,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I knew it had to be spiritual.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And so all my life, I've
explored the world's religions.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Mysticism, the saints, just
been very, very interesting.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, after such an
enlightening experience

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that would be the
logical place to look.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And let me ask you something.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I saw you a couple weeks
ago in Nevada City.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And as I was dialing in,
I think you were talking

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
at one point about the
ability-- when you were young,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.350 align:middle line:84%
you were actually seeing beyond
the veil into other areas.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:84%
You know I've had a number of
experiences throughout my life

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
when I've had a peek into
a reality other than this.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Several times when I was
young, but particularly,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:90%
that experience.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you read in texts that
everything's made out of light.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The physicists tell you,
it's made out of light.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would have these moments
when I could actually see it.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I could see that
matter was energy,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
made out of light.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And as an adult, I've
had that many times

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:90%
in states of lucid dreaming.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And in what Raymond Moody calls
an empathic death experience

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.300 align:middle line:84%
where you're not
the one who's dying,

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
but you're with a
loved one who's dying.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And when they go into
the light, you also go.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Both my son and I had that
experience when my mother died.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm fortunate because
in terms of resilience,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, part of the
characteristic of resilience

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
is that you have
faith in something.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
mean faith in God

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:90%
or faith in something specific.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But I have a great deal of
faith that this universe

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:90%
is a friendly place.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.110 align:middle line:84%
That was the big question
of Albert Einstein.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.440 align:middle line:84%
How wonderful to have
that understanding

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
at a very young age.
-Yes.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean was that enough
of a companion to you

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that it really did skew the
way you approached the rest

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:90%
of your life after that?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
You know you can have
an experience like that

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:90%
and still get frightened.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:90%
You can forget.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I think we forget
very frequently

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:90%
things that would help us.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And what it was is it set a
place for me of remembering.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it's taken a number
of difficult experiences

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
over the lifetime before I've
become much more established

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:90%
in that place of resilience.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I read that book "A
Gradual Awakening"

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
with Steven Levine
years ago, and I think

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:90%
that's, for me, what it's been.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:90%
So you ultimately grew up.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
We're going to fast
forward a little bit, well,

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
"The Autobiography Of
A Yogi" also factored

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.910 align:middle line:84%
in there, in your teenage
years, as I recall.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So this took you further
down the spiritual path

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But, ultimately, you had to
contend with medical school.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, what
I had decided was this.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I decided I would
not be a physician.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:90%
That I would be a researcher.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I was very
interested in neuroscience.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I was very interested,
well, I'll get to the cancer

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:90%
part of my interest later.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:84%
But I decided I was mostly
interested in the mind.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And the pharmacology department
at Harvard Medical School

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
was involved in the very
first biofeedback experiments.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.561 align:middle line:84%
Where I mean this was
big news in the '60.

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
-Absolutely.
-Very big news.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
How is it that you could take an
unconscious process like blood

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
pressure and make it
conscious and learn to modify

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:90%
your own physical responses?

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:90%
That was really big news.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:90%
We knew about that from yoga.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:90%
But it was scientific.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And I chose Harvard
Medical School because I

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:90%
was very interested in that.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up, I
have a doctorate

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:90%
from Harvard in cell biology.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.762 align:middle line:90%
And then being an overacheiver--

00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:90%
As you are.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I did three more post docs.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you are the smartest
person Wayne Dyer has ever met.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:90%
That's I think what he meant.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I have a post-doctoral
fellowship

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:90%
in cancer cell biology.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And I ran a big, active lab for
years funded by the National

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Cancer Institute and
taught first at Tufts

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Medical School then at Harvard.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And then two more post-docs.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
One in the almost
unpronounceable

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:90%
word of psychoneuroimmunology.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.025 align:middle line:84%
You are an overachiever.
But I'm glad.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad for that.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Because explain that to us.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Well,
psychoneuroimmunology means

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
the pathways through which our
thinking turns into hormones,

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
turns into molecules
of emotion turns

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:84%
into brain activity
that ultimately

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:90%
changes the immune system.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, why does
stress compromise immunity?

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And I have been absolutely
fascinated in that.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And then in the opposite,
why does love enhance

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:90%
and balance your immune system?

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I have loved doing
that kind of research.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And then finally my third
post-doc was in the field

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:90%
called behavioral medicine.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is how do you
take all these findings

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and make them
relevant to our lives?

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.170 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when
somebody's come in

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're traumatized or
they're going through a really

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
difficult period to help them
calm down their nervous system

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and find the means
for resilience.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's the work I've
done for many years.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of work.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I mean the
wonderful thing about it

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
is by taking these
challenges on academically,

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
you were able to connect a
tremendous number of dots

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
that other people in any one of
those disciplines would miss.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think really that's
the gift of your work.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
You write about these various
modalities that we can use

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and tools in a very
approachable way.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is we
have all of the benefit

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
of this academic discipline
behind you and connecting

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
the dots because you've
had these experiences

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.775 align:middle line:90%
spiritually as well.

00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So after you go
through all of that,

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:90%
I want to ask one question.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is what did you come
to find about what science

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and medicine even in these
very forward thinking

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:84%
programs simply didn't
understand about the human mind

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:90%
and emotions?

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know science
is based on the ability

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:90%
to measure things.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing that comes up

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:90%
is a question like this.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
If you truly think that
the mind is non-local.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:84%
That's a term that Larry
Darcy, a wonderful physician,

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
coined I think back in 1988 in
his book "Recovering The Soul".

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
mind, essentially,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:90%
is infinite, immortal, eternal.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And he showed all kinds
of evidence for this.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
People who can see what's
happening at a distance.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I've had many
experiences like that.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
As a young mother, for example,
I was riding in the car.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I felt
a tug right here,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:90%
right where the thymus is.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a vision of the
pressure cooker exploding

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and the hot liquid
from it burning

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.465 align:middle line:90%
my son who was in a playpen.

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
He was about a year
old, 14 months old.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough I went home.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And I found he had been burned.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
My husband took him to the
doctor and all of that.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:90%
But what is that about?

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:90%
That empathic connection.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:90%
That empathic connection.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It speaks to the
fact that information

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
flows at some level that's
not localized to your brain.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what Larry means.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It's non-local.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:90%
It's spread out there.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And if we all have access to
that field of information,

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
kind of a greater mind,
then that's amazing.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And it has to change the way
that you look at the brain.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And instead of the brain
creating all of that,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
it's more like a
television set that's

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:84%
the receiver for this
information that is broadcast

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:90%
and into which you broadcast.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Now there have been some
scientific studies, which

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
of course we can get
into to look at that,

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:84%
but by and large
scientists will cross

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
their eyeballs if you start
to bring up topics like this.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's always good as
a scientist to be humble

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and to realize that most of
medicine is based on anecdotes,

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
is based on putting together
stories from different sources

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:90%
about what worked.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And much of what's central
to the canon of medicine

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:90%
has never been proved.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.081 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
the mechanism.

00:14:53.081 --> 00:14:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It was like, what,
20, 25 years ago

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
that we finally figured
out why aspirin worked.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And so not understanding
something is not

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:90%
proof that it doesn't exist.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes, thank you very much.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's a missing piece
because a lot of people

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
will not trust in their own
instincts and intuition,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:84%
nor in other practitioners
that are perfectly

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
valid in their abilities to help
them in their healing process

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.241 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't have the
Harvard stamp of approval

00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Or it hasn't been validated
by someone like you.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
For example, with
your background.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.990 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, well, I
want to get into something

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.120 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned a moment ago.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
This empathy is really
driven by emotions.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what we're talking
about in terms of the field

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and our connection to each
other, this non-local field,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:84%
is much more driven by
emotion than I think

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:90%
was thought until very recently.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
very interesting.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's like when people look
at things like prayer studies.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Some of them work.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Some of them don't work.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And people throw up
their hands and say well,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:90%
it must be nothing.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
because certain studies

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:90%
are really hard to do.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:12.010 align:middle line:84%
If I were to say, OK, pray for
Regina's toenail over whatever.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:84%
There's no connection if I've
just put that out to a group.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:90%
They don't know who you are.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a person
that I love and I cherish.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I think of you,
I can see your healing.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%
That's very different.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And so those kinds
of studies are

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
difficult to do in
large enough numbers

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to reach statistical
significance.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.620 align:middle line:90%
And I just wanted to read this.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.191 align:middle line:84%
This is out of your book, or
maybe it was out of your talk.

00:16:41.191 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I forget now.
Because I blended them.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned, there's one
particular quote that says,

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.040 align:middle line:84%
the mind is a self
organizing process

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that shapes how
information and energy

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:90%
moves across time and space.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:90%
That is so elegant.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
a direct quote

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
from a psychiatrist, Dan Siegel,
who started the Mindsight

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Institute at UCLA.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.079 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a broad
view of the mind.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting about
that definition, Regina,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:84%
is that it was agreed upon by
a large number of scientists

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that he brought together in
diverse fields from sociology

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:84%
to psychology to
mathematics to physics.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about that, the
field of information which is--

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Like a processing unit.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and it's self organizing.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And that information
is out there.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting
because I've heard a lot of

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and read a lot of
esoteric material

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:84%
that speaks about the
memory and our experience

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
not being in our
physical brains.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
This is somehow
accessing a larger field.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people would refer
to it as the aura.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of personal
matrix of energy that stores

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:90%
our personal information.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Others would say it's
larger than that.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of a universal
matrix of information

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that simultaneously
exists in time and space

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:90%
you know backward and forward.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
looking at this,

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
we realize the mind has
incredible abilities not only

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of understanding
the matrix we live in,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:90%
but in terms of healing.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot to work with
that we didn't realize

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.210 align:middle line:90%
we had even just a decade ago.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, we do.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
quite fascinating

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to watch the emergence
of new fields

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
like energy medicine
and energy psychology.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And once again it's somewhat
hard to study but not entirely.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
There are some studies
on therapeutic touch

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
where you're not
touching the person.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But what you have is an
intention for compassion.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
important thing.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:84%
That's that empathy that
you were talking about,

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:90%
that emotional connection.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And, for example,
one of those studies

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
showed a change in the immune
system of the person being

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
treated but a similar
change in the person

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:90%
who was giving the treatment.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:90%
So both of them.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Both of them moved
into some kind of field

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:90%
of health because of that.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we need, of course, is
more experiments of this sort.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
There's been enough that at most
hospitals around the country

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:84%
now, you have divisions
of complementary medicine

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
where, for example, some nurse
will come in and actually do

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:90%
therapeutic or healing touch.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And the patient is getting
all of the other treatments

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:90%
But that's added on.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:90%
And I'd really like to see that.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Now we need really basic changes
like good food in hospitals.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Good food and all that.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Little bit of sunlight
and fresh air.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:90%
That wouldn't hurt.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many years ago,
I was shooting a story,

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:84%
this was in the mid 80s, at
the Wegman Clinic outside

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.840 align:middle line:84%
of Dornach, Switzerland,
which was very much associated

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:84%
with anthroposophical medicine,
Rudolf Steiner's work, Waldorf

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:90%
schools and all of that.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And I mean you almost wanted
to become ill just to be

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:84%
able to enjoy that facility.
I'm joking.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, again, you're
talking about everything

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.350 align:middle line:90%
that lifts the human spirit.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:90%
They had artwork.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:84%
They went into these
amazing color therapy rooms,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:84%
where you sat and
the entire room was

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:90%
cycled through various colors.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Which then they would
test you afterwards

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
to see the resiliency
of your immune system

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
based on how you were
reacting to these colors.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You had music, fabulous food,
every room had a little garden.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was really,
you started seeing

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.790 align:middle line:90%
the real elements that heal us.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And this was for
cancer specifically.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know absolutely.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.305 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done in really
a very prestigious journal, I

00:20:57.305 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
think it was actually
published in "Science",

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's been out
for a long time.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:90%
It must be a 15-year-old study.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But it just looked at people who
had a certain kind of surgery

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and what their hospital
room looked like.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:84%
If your room looked
out on nature,

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.285 align:middle line:84%
you got out of the hospital
roughly a day sooner

00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and needed less pain
medication than if you

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.700 align:middle line:90%
looked at a parking lot.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like, are we separate
from the environment, no.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:90%
We're part of it.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm looking,
there's a beautiful plant

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:90%
in the corner of this room.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
arrangement of succulents.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's much different than if
I was looking at a wastebasket.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
I mean probably

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
the most important factor is our
relationships with each other.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And our trust in each other.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know there have been many
studies done on placebo effect

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and about the effect
of the person's trust

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:84%
in the person that's
taking care of them.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's a
doctor or another kind

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:90%
of health care provider.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.192 align:middle line:90%
There's good evidence.

00:22:00.192 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:90%
So we know that's true.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
tell your story,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.750 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's hysterical,
about the bad doctor.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
The person who lacked,
not only all empathy,

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:90%
but was really just silly.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:90%
She was just silly.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:90%
And I think she was fried.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I told that story
in my book "Fried",

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.920 align:middle line:84%
which is a book about why you
burn out and how to revive.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.225 align:middle line:84%
This is the best
example I've heard.

00:22:24.225 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Health care professionals,
some 60% of physicians,

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:90%
are burned out.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Which means that
they're exhausted

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:90%
emotionally and physically.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Which means that they lose
the capacity for empathy.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:84%
They're just so, they
can't take anything else.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, their function,
their efficiency, what

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:90%
they can do declines greatly.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.646 align:middle line:84%
And then they may be
substance abusing, who knows?

00:22:50.646 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But I went to the doctor, this
is when I was working in Boston

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:84%
at Tufts Medical School,
I go to the doctor

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:84%
because I've pulled
a muscle in my back.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:90%
I've got two little kids.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:84%
You know you're schleping the
car seats and all of that.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a yoga teacher.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And I keep thinking,
oh, I better

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
lay off the yoga
because it's making

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:90%
an inflammation in the injury.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So I go in, first queue
that something's wrong,

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
her office was and I swear
I'm not exaggerating,

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:90%
it had to be in the mid 90's.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.690 align:middle line:84%
You'd think either
she was going to do

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:84%
bikram yoga or roast
a flock of turkeys

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:90%
in front of this space heater.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And she herself was
sitting in a heavy sweater

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
picking the little
balls off of it.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:90%
She didn't even look at me.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:90%
No energy.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Heat, picking balls off.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:84%
She could not make
any connection.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And finally I'm
like coaching her,

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:90%
don't you want to examine me?

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And like should I
stop doing yoga?

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:90%
What should I do?

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I said I think I've
sprained a muscle.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And at this point she perks
up, and she says, not so fast.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.702 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you have cancer.

00:24:01.702 --> 00:24:02.402 align:middle line:90%
I just love that.

00:24:02.402 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
irresponsible medical story

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I think I've ever heard.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.477 align:middle line:84%
You know she was like
annoyed at the world.

00:24:12.477 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of it.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
She probably told everybody
that passed through the door

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
that they had cancer.
-Yes.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I
thought, I know better.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:84%
My degree is in
cellular biology.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a cancer cell biologist,
and I've studied anatomy.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I know I don't have cancer.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.754 align:middle line:84%
But can you imagine what
the effect would be?

00:24:30.754 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it would terrible.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Because she's in a
position of authority.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:84%
You've come to her
because she's supposed

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:90%
to know what she's doing.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:84%
To tell you such
a horrible thing.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you were an innocent
person that didn't have

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.300 align:middle line:90%
your knowledge that came in.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
What she could have spun into
motion inside their body.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:90%
You know Leonard Laskow?

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I know who he is.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, because he's
written about that.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Where they did some
research out of Berkeley

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:84%
on love and its effect
on cancer cells.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.660 align:middle line:90%
And the reversal of the cancer.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
This woman was the
antithesis of that.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.771 align:middle line:84%
-She was.
-Oh, my goodness.

00:25:02.771 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:90%
That's horrible.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to pick it up with
the story of our resilience

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and also another little
story on how bad news

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.060 align:middle line:84%
can so dramatically
impact our immune system

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:90%
to the point of death.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.247 align:middle line:84%
And we'll pick that story
up in just a minute.

00:25:19.247 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just
take a little break.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.230 align:middle line:84%
We're back with Joan
Borysenko, and I

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:84%
want to pick up the
conversation where we left off.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Another story you
told was about-- it

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:90%
has to do with voodoo.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean truly voodoo.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Where someone can deliver some
really frightening or bad news,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
or put out a really evil
intent, and another person

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
believes in that intent to
cause unimaginable damage.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell about that.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
You know this was a fascination
of a mentor of mine, Herbert

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Benson, who he was the
cardiologist who first studied

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
meditation and
found the physiology

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.290 align:middle line:90%
of the relaxation response.

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:90%
What it did to the body.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:10%
He was fascinated with
the placebo effect

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:10%
and also with voodoo death.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:10%
Because if the placebo
effect is about healing,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:10%
voodoo death is about the
power of the mind to kill.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:10%
So for example, he found that
in certain tribes in Africa,

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.870 align:middle line:10%
there was a tradition
where a medicine man

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:middle line:10%
would curse you for something.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you were cursed, you'd
go into your sleeping quarters,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and there would be a
bone placed on your bed.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And this was called
pointing the bone.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And if people said, my god, the
bone has been pointed at me,

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
they would die
within a day's time.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:90%
This is really documented?

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:90%
This is really documented.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
But you know Viktor Frankl when
he wrote the most wonderful

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:84%
book on resilience,
"Man's Search for Meaning"

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:90%
told something really similar.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:84%
When people give up hope that's
the final common denominator,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.920 align:middle line:84%
you have no hope,
you're in a box

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
of I'm not going
to survive here,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.780 align:middle line:90%
you will die very frequently.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And so he noticed this in
the concentration camp.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:84%
That when people gave
up the will to live,

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:84%
you knew right
away, he said they'd

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:90%
smoke their own cigarettes.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Because those were a medium
of exchange in the camps.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened, they'd
sit on the edge of their bed,

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and very often they'd kill
right over from a heart attack

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:84%
or some other form
of vasospasm that

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:90%
leads to rapid cardiac death.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And if that didn't
happen what would happen

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:90%
were immune changes.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The stress was so
terrific that they'd

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:84%
become open to the
next kind of epidemic,

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe typhoid or cholera
that ravaged the camps.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the system is
already been reduced.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, I just wanted
you to share that.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a very stark, but I think
a very important point to make.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
That that's how
powerful the mechanism

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.210 align:middle line:90%
of fear and loss of hope is.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:20.131 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to get to
the specifics of resilience

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
in your book.
And I wanted to go back to 2008.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:90%
You had your own shock.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And you say admittedly,
that in your lifetime,

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:84%
you've often operated
on pessimism.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.735 align:middle line:84%
You know your first
response was to be

00:28:31.735 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:90%
ugh, how do I deal with this?

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.309 align:middle line:84%
That's right.
That's how I'm wired.

00:28:34.309 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And probably most people
are wired that way.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.185 align:middle line:90%
So 2008.

00:28:39.185 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, 2008, the
stock market crashed.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I thought
to myself, well, that's it.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll never retire.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:90%
You lost a fair amount in that.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, I did.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.640 align:middle line:90%
You know, so many of us did.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And I had friends who lost
everything to Bernie Madoff.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
financial difficulty.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I went to a
conference, and I heard

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.680 align:middle line:84%
a story from another speaker
about a friend of his

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:84%
in his 30's who was a
broker on Wall Street

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and whose response was
jumping out a window.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I think I better
write a book on resilience.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing with
my own response in 2008

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
is that I can recognize
pessimistic thinking

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:84%
for what it without taking
it necessarily so seriously.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's some of the
movies that my mind

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:90%
habitually creates.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:84%
I have the wiring
that does that.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the truth.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:90%
When I believe that.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I've left the world
of possibility.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've entered a
very narrow space.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm like thinking
in the box, and I

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:90%
can't see my way out of it.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone listening
to this relates to that.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you have learned
about something very suddenly.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And your initial coping response
will be very much like it

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.280 align:middle line:90%
was when you were a child.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what happens.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:90%
There's an instant regression.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But that's only the
beginning of the story.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not the end.
-Right.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this happened
again to you in 2010.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.090 align:middle line:84%
We have fires going on
right now in Colorado.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows
about that if they're

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:90%
paying attention to the news.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.120 align:middle line:84%
But you had them a
couple years ago.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And you had a tremendous
amount of damage to your home.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:84%
It was called the Four
Mile Canyon Wildfire.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And I lived at the top of
Four Mile Canyon in Boulder.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.600 align:middle line:90%
169 homes were burned.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:90%
And many thousands of acres.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And we lost, we were at
the epicenter of the fire.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
16 of our neighbors
were destroyed.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
We thought our
house was destroyed.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But it took three or four
days to find the house

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.360 align:middle line:84%
was standing, partly
burned, but standing.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84%
One of our out
buildings had burned.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.680 align:middle line:90%
But many, many trees had burned.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And when we came back, it
looked like a lunar landscape.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Stinky, black shiny.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Your mean your neighbors gone.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
can we live here?

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And we'll never sell it.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.500 align:middle line:84%
They sent out insurance
adjusters immediately.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And you saw the price of your
property drop by 50% overnight.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And you saw a lot of
your things disappear.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you saw a
lot of your things.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And we lived in a house that
was empty for about six months.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they come to
clean up after the fire.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.852 align:middle line:84%
They take everything
out of your house.

00:31:39.852 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Even your Christmas ribbons
go to the dry cleaner.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Very disorienting.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing left.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.770 align:middle line:90%
The walls are devoid of art.

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.000 align:middle line:90%
There are no rugs.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So in two years time you had
two big psychological shocks

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:90%
to your system.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But because of your
own work and also

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:90%
what happened to your father.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:84%
You know I mean that
was another story.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why I left
the laboratory.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.146 align:middle line:84%
Please explain just briefly
so we can get back to the book.

00:32:05.146 --> 00:32:05.846 align:middle line:90%
It's big.

00:32:05.846 --> 00:32:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, my father, in my
late 20's, my father,

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.200 align:middle line:84%
very beloved father,
the most gentle,

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.350 align:middle line:84%
compassionate, sweetest
man in the world,

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:90%
found out that he had cancer.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was given a
drug that was helping

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:90%
to keep the cancer in check.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But it created in him
a manic psychosis.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a stranger
had moved into his skin.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:84%
He got taken off that
drug for surgery.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And he clearly made a decision.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And that was that life was
not worth living like that.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up one morning
at 6 o'clock to a call

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that he had jumped
out of the window

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:90%
of their 36 story condominium.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was how
he chose to die.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
said to myself, either

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go down here
and into despair and grief,

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.620 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to
do something that

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.280 align:middle line:90%
helps give meaning to his life.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Because part of
the problem was he

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.170 align:middle line:84%
had physicians who did not
see him as a human being.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
When you're treating
cells and the patient

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:84%
is like dying over here
because he's lost who he is,

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:90%
this is not good medicine.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why
does medicine not

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.760 align:middle line:90%
care for the whole human being?

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Why does it not care for
our emotions and our soul?

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Because as we spent in the
first part of the program,

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.480 align:middle line:84%
like that has so much bearing
on health and healing.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I said I know
everything about cancer cells

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and not a thing about people
with cancer, their families.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I retrained,
and I got licensed

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.380 align:middle line:90%
as a clinical psychologist.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And went back to work with
Herb Benson at Harvard

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:90%
and opened a Mind Body clinic.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.120 align:middle line:84%
First for people with cancer
then for people with AIDS.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
That was the very beginning
of the epidemic, Regina,

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.810 align:middle line:84%
when you know there
were no drug cocktails.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:84%
People died often within a
month or two of diagnosis.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.889 align:middle line:84%
And then I opened
a clinic for people

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.219 align:middle line:90%
with stress related disorders.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a good
example of how when you're

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:23.570 align:middle line:84%
severely shocked and
traumatized by something,

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:28.320 align:middle line:84%
either you despair or you
remake your life, you transform.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's what resilience is.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.139 align:middle line:90%
And you did it.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I did do it.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:90%
And I've done it several times.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:84%
And I look back over
the course of my life

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and all these awful things
are things that in the end,

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.280 align:middle line:90%
you give a bow to life.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Like I'm clearly not in control.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:84%
This is nothing I ever
would have chosen.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And yet it shaped who
I am as a human being.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.830 align:middle line:84%
All those things have been such
teachers not only of resilience

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:03.460 align:middle line:90%
but teachers of compassion.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
take a look at what

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:84%
spiritual and
psychological maturity are,

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
they come down to
the same thing.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.560 align:middle line:84%
That capacity to be
present in the moment,

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.130 align:middle line:90%
the capacity to be kind.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.790 align:middle line:84%
A sense of compassion
a connection

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.240 align:middle line:84%
to the whole of
life, and the ability

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.350 align:middle line:84%
to receive the beauty of
life, the feast of life

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.110 align:middle line:90%
with such great appreciation.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you learn.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And you really detailed a
lot of this in this book.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And now let's get into some
of the nuts and bolts of it.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Because interestingly
on one hand,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at a doctor
that comes in and says,

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.920 align:middle line:90%
oh, I think you have cancer.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe you do.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.155 align:middle line:84%
OK, and part of this
you're saying is you

00:35:51.155 --> 00:35:54.110 align:middle line:84%
have to be able to
embrace reality.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:57.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to accept
what is in the beginning.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to lie to yourself.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, that has a lot of baggage
with it too on one level.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you can
clarify what it means

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
to accept what is
without being taken down

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.220 align:middle line:90%
into a state of hopelessness.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So for example resilience
has been studied.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're studying
prisoners of war or people

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.240 align:middle line:84%
who've survived concentration
camps or people who've survived

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.860 align:middle line:84%
illness or children who were
abused or companies by the way,

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:84%
this is as true of
corporations as it is people.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.220 align:middle line:84%
You'll find that the basic
aspects of resilience,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.190 align:middle line:84%
let me just enumerate them,
and then we'll talk about them.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:40.950 align:middle line:90%
You talked about realism.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.540 align:middle line:90%
And we'll look at that.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But looking at reality squarely
and not making up fancy stories

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.320 align:middle line:90%
that end up and denial.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:84%
The second is to have
faith in something,

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.550 align:middle line:84%
a larger perspective that
stops you from putting

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:90%
yourself in the box.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.340 align:middle line:90%
The third is radical creativity.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And I love that.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:84%
What does it like to
become radically creative.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Then you need the
support of other people.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.410 align:middle line:90%
You need mentors and allies.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.390 align:middle line:90%
And those are right up there.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And you need a good
sense of humor.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Life is absurd.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
see the absurdity,

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:90%
you'll do a lot better.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So those are some
of the main things.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.840 align:middle line:90%
There are more.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:90%
But getting back to realism.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.300 align:middle line:90%
I call it optimizing realism.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you an example.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:84%
For example, I have a friend
who is a green builder.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And in 2008 when the
recession started,

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.450 align:middle line:84%
the bottom fell out
of green building.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.990 align:middle line:90%
There was no work.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And some of his friends,
said, look there's no work.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever you can.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Go get a job at Starbucks.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It'll cut down the burn
of the money at least.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying, oh no,
I will think positively.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.890 align:middle line:90%
The world is going green.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
stay positive, and I'm

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:90%
going to draw this to me.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up being
bankrupt and losing his home.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And that is
unrealistic optimism.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's really denial.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:11.980 align:middle line:90%
That's unrealistic thinking.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.400 align:middle line:90%
That's denial.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of
people, they think

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that it's positive thinking,
but, in fact, it's denial.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It is most important that
you adjust your sails

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.110 align:middle line:90%
to the prevalent winds.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't just expect
they're going to change

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.000 align:middle line:90%
or complain about them.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.980 align:middle line:90%
You actually do something.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a wonderful
television special

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
that probably some of
your listeners saw,

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and if you didn't, they
can take a look at it now.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a PBS special called
"This Emotional Life".

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let me write that down.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, I haven't seen it.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.430 align:middle line:90%
It was eight hours.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Two, four hour segments.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:39:01.890 align:middle line:84%
There was a great segment about
a POW who talked about realism.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They realized, the POW's
in this installation,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.650 align:middle line:84%
that unless they could
communicate with each other,

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:90%
they were going to lose hope.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:90%
They would despair.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Become depressed.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.410 align:middle line:90%
That would be the end of them.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that realism allowed
them to optimize the situation

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:84%
because they figured out a
tapping code so that they could

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.820 align:middle line:90%
communicate with each other.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I mean.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually tune in
and be present to the situation.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the
creative part comes in.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But on that same note,
I read, and forgive me,

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:90%
it may have been in your book.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I read a lot of books.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It was talking about that
same situation with POW's.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that actually
made it out of there

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.880 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that accepted,
this is going to be a grind.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.540 align:middle line:90%
It's going to last for a while.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.206 align:middle line:84%
The ones that we're optimistic,
exceedingly optimistic--

00:39:55.206 --> 00:39:55.905 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:55.905 --> 00:39:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we'll be out of
here by next week.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Kept going through one
kind of emotional setback

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.830 align:middle line:84%
after another, after
another, till it wound them

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.040 align:middle line:84%
down to the point
where some of them

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:84%
never got out because
they simply didn't survive

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.940 align:middle line:84%
physically and emotionally.
-That's right.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
disappointed over and over.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But when you say to yourself,
hey, they know we're here.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.360 align:middle line:90%
We'll be out by Christmas.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And Christmas comes and goes.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.790 align:middle line:84%
We'll be out by Thanksgiving,
we'll be out by New Year's.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:22.620 align:middle line:90%
We'll be--

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
wonderful example

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of where we need to hold on
to what is genuinely real.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about pessimism.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about optimism.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:84%
If I can share
just for a moment.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at
this, and I thought,

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.400 align:middle line:90%
where do I fit into this?

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks
I'm an optimist.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think I generally am
very resilient and an optimist.

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:45.900 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm first
given some kind

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of uncomfortable news or even
anything that involves change.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Change, whether it's good.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Change or whether
it's change that could

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.080 align:middle line:90%
seem not good at face value.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The notion of change
frightens a lot of people.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And myself--
-It sure does.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.880 align:middle line:84%
My friends and family wouldn't
probably know this about me.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.870 align:middle line:84%
When I'm first confronted with
something, it's startling.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And I think, oh, I don't know.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't, I don't
know about that.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So my first reaction
is negative.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But within a few minutes, I'll
say, oh, I'll process through.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:90%
What could happen out of this.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably one of those
overly optimistic people

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:20.500 align:middle line:90%
in denial a lot of time too.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'll usually
adapt pretty quickly.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.181 align:middle line:84%
But my first response is
also fearful and negative.

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.090 align:middle line:90%
So I understand that very well.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And you like me have changed the
brain circuitry so the old one

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:33.040 align:middle line:90%
may kick in first.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.300 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't last for long.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.510 align:middle line:90%
So pessimism.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a great deal
of research on it.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
prime investigators

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.230 align:middle line:84%
is Marty Seligman,
who's a psychologist,

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:48.030 align:middle line:84%
professor of psychology at the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's also the father of
quote positive psychology.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And that merits
just a definition.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Because psychology used to
study what was wrong with you.

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't study
what was right with you.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Like things like
what is resilience?

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So positive psychology
looks at that aspect.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Pessimism and
optimism are really

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:15.370 align:middle line:84%
based on your
explanatory style, which

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.520 align:middle line:84%
means when something
bad happens, how

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.650 align:middle line:90%
do you explain it to yourself?

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the question.
-Explain that please.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.470 align:middle line:90%
An example.

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:27.470 align:middle line:90%
My kids were teenagers.

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:29.640 align:middle line:84%
We went out in a boat
for the first time.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.000 align:middle line:90%
We had just gotten a new boat.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.510 align:middle line:84%
My husband was away
for the weekend.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And I let the kids
talk me into going out.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.690 align:middle line:90%
We knew nothing about boating.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're going down the
river toward the ocean

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.060 align:middle line:90%
on The East Coast.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And we see these
barrels floating.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Red ones, green ones.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.010 align:middle line:90%
I said what is the barrels?

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:48.800 align:middle line:90%
We knew nothing.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know it.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They marked the
navigable channel.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:84%
On the way home, on
the way back up river,

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:58.510 align:middle line:84%
after we'd been out in the
ocean, the tide was out.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And we were outside
the channel of barrels.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.410 align:middle line:90%
And we ran aground.

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:03.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:90%
I've got three kids.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.020 align:middle line:90%
It's getting cold.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.660 align:middle line:90%
It's late in the afternoon.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:90%
We have run aground.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:90%
This is a minor stressful event.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.630 align:middle line:90%
How do I explain it to myself?

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what
explanatory style is.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I explained it in terms of what
Seligman calls the three P's

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:24.780 align:middle line:90%
of pessimism and helplessness.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.120 align:middle line:84%
That is first of all,
I took it personally.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:33.140 align:middle line:84%
You know this is
entirely my fault.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.220 align:middle line:90%
So there's self blame.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.200 align:middle line:90%
The second P is it's pervasive.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Because my internal dialogue
was going something like I'll

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:44.631 align:middle line:84%
leave out the expletives
since this is television.

00:43:44.631 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:84%
You're right.
Thank you.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh drat.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.880 align:middle line:90%
We're stuck on a sandbar.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.080 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a stupid mother
who knows nothing about boating

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:90%
takes their kids boating?

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I know what kind of a stupid
mother, one who works.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:84%
My kids have never
gotten what they

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.040 align:middle line:90%
needed because I've worked.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.780 align:middle line:84%
They will probably have to
go to therapy for 20 years.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm thinking,
you know, it's

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:90%
so hard being a working mother.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.140 align:middle line:84%
These are the
things that happen.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I don't have
enough time with my husband.

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:13.855 align:middle line:84%
Those are your first
kinds of thoughts?

00:44:13.855 --> 00:44:15.410 align:middle line:90%
This was it.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:18.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like all at
once these flood in.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Because they're so familiar.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.230 align:middle line:84%
They're all the ways that
we criticize ourselves.

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Thus the word pervasive.

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Pervasive.

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Personal, pervasive, and
the third is permanent.

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:90%
It's the story of your life.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.530 align:middle line:90%
You always end up like this.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Seligman
says is the definition

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.950 align:middle line:84%
of the explanatory
style of a pessimist.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It's all my fault. I
mess up everything I do.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's the story of my life.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And so constantly if you look
at all the stories you've

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:49.780 align:middle line:84%
told yourself over time
about why bad things happen,

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.840 align:middle line:84%
if you're a pessimist, they will
all hang on that same thread.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.640 align:middle line:90%
You can change it.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.800 align:middle line:90%
You can dispute it.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is even if you're
an optimist, a lot of times

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.460 align:middle line:84%
if you have a momentary
jolt to the system,

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.340 align:middle line:84%
even if it lasts five
minutes or even a day,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.860 align:middle line:84%
for example, on
something, you can feel

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.530 align:middle line:90%
like it's the end of the world.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.350 align:middle line:90%
Like it's never going to end.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I experience that.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I do have that feeling
from time to time.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is going on, if
it's negative, oh my god,

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:90%
this is how it's going to be.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll find my way out of it.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about how
you find your way out of it

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.870 align:middle line:84%
quickly as we've learned to do.
-Yes.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:30.110 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you need to
do is to recognize you're

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.130 align:middle line:90%
telling yourself a story.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not reality.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
This is just the
programming of your brain.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.560 align:middle line:84%
You're wired from long
use for that circuit.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now we know all
about neural plasticity.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And we understand
that we develop

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.710 align:middle line:90%
new circuitry as we get older.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And we develop it
through repetition.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you know what pessimism
is, now the listeners know.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:58.140 align:middle line:84%
-They can say I am or I am not.
-That's right.

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.680 align:middle line:84%
When that thinking comes
up, you can say to yourself,

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.670 align:middle line:90%
there it is.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.230 align:middle line:90%
That's pessimistic thinking.

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the story
that I tell myself.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell myself
a different story.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell myself
the story of yeah,

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:13.500 align:middle line:90%
this is a difficult thing now.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Nobody likes change.

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter
is when life crashes

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.610 align:middle line:84%
the way we know it, I can
take this as a challenge

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.730 align:middle line:90%
to reinvent myself.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:26.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the kind of
optimism that keeps you stuck.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.940 align:middle line:84%
What we understand
about stress hardiness

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:38.310 align:middle line:84%
is this is now the work
of Suzanne Willett Cobasa

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.470 align:middle line:84%
that people who are
hardy against stress

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:42.570 align:middle line:90%
have this explanatory style.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Something difficult
happens, they say,

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.040 align:middle line:90%
cool it's a challenge.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.610 align:middle line:84%
When we were on that sandbar,
my 14-year-old son Justin

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:52.530 align:middle line:90%
was thrilled.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:90%
He was thrilled.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:54.330 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, best day
of my whole life.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Because now I get to rescue us.

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So for him, he had the
stress hardy thing.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.820 align:middle line:90%
It was a challenge.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.090 align:middle line:90%
When you're stress hardy.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.490 align:middle line:84%
You also know something
about control.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:10.480 align:middle line:84%
You stick to what
you can control,

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.820 align:middle line:90%
and let go of what you can't.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So that you put your energy
where it can make a difference.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
is you maintain

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.720 align:middle line:84%
a commitment to sticking
with whatever the problem is.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.050 align:middle line:90%
You stay engaged.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Because pessimist will
tend to turn the other way.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:28.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't like conflict.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Or they don't like this or that.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Or they're having a dispute
with somebody at work,

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.460 align:middle line:84%
you have to be engaged
and hang in there.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me ask
you about that.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that
pessimists would often

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:44.490 align:middle line:84%
turn to say prescription
drugs or something

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to basically blunt the pain
and just turn the other cheek.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Is that a common defense
if you are a pessimist.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
very common defense.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is that
you're set up to feel helpless

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and what Seligman discovered
is that a very, a very good

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:05.920 align:middle line:84%
explanation of how at
least some subset of people

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:11.350 align:middle line:84%
ends up depressed is they slide
from pessimism into depression.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you
know if you're in pain,

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:16.146 align:middle line:84%
isn't it human to
want to feel better.

00:48:16.146 --> 00:48:16.845 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:48:16.845 --> 00:48:20.701 align:middle line:84%
So you'll go for cigarettes,
you'll go for alcohol.

00:48:20.701 --> 00:48:21.670 align:middle line:84%
You'll go for--
-Ice cream.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Prescription drugs.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, all the good things.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:28.550 align:middle line:90%
And put on a lot of weight.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:31.550 align:middle line:84%
What we found, what the
research is on adverse childhood

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:36.820 align:middle line:84%
experiences, and kids who've
had a hard time as children

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.370 align:middle line:84%
you can quantify that
on a scale from one

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:43.310 align:middle line:90%
to six adverse experiences.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The ones who have a high level
are much more likely to be

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:48.690 align:middle line:90%
depressed later in their life.

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're much more likely
to be substance abusers.

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But they're also much more
likely to be overweight.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to the problems
we have with the food supply--

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So were trying to comfort
ourselves on all levels.

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
comfort ourselves.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk
about engaging our

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.250 align:middle line:90%
create-- we have to be flexible.

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:10.410 align:middle line:84%
We have to engage our
creativity as well.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't
know what that feels like.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they have been
feeling like they're

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:16.640 align:middle line:90%
victim of circumstance.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.850 align:middle line:84%
How do you reengage
your creativity

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:21.050 align:middle line:90%
if you haven't been using it.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Say, you've lost your job, and
now you're really feeling like,

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.300 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, I'm whatever age.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's going to hire me.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.400 align:middle line:90%
There are no jobs out there.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're really
starting to feel helpless.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.240 align:middle line:90%
How do you start reengaging?

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And maybe give us a couple of
cool little stories of people

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.940 align:middle line:90%
who have said, heck, with that.

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
something happen, and did.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know I remember
a story of a patient I had,

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.580 align:middle line:84%
not in this recession,
but in one in the 1980's.

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And he had been an
engineer, and there

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.070 align:middle line:90%
weren't jobs in engineering.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And he started out thinking of
you know, pessimism, pessimism.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.750 align:middle line:90%
I'll never get a job here.

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
well, maybe I'll

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.650 align:middle line:90%
never get a job as an engineer.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.720 align:middle line:90%
What would I rather do?

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.044 align:middle line:90%
What have I always wanted to do?

00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:06.210 align:middle line:84%
That is the beauty
of these times.

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:07.544 align:middle line:84%
Many people are having
that opportunity.

00:50:07.544 --> 00:50:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
That's it.

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm already broke.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.760 align:middle line:90%
So I'll take out a student loan.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
went back to school

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and he became a marriage
and family therapist.

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
complete turn around.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the question.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is all about
getting out of the box.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if you
engage other people,

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:34.660 align:middle line:84%
that's a way of
getting out of the box.

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:35.870 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Get together with a group of
five or six trusted friends.

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And say, OK, I'm
going to say my piece.

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:43.210 align:middle line:90%
This is how I feel.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.270 align:middle line:90%
This is what is happening.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And invite people then
to respond to you.

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily by
giving you advice.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.780 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's
the littlest thing.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Somebody responds to
your emotional tone.

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And it kicks up an
idea that's different.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But isn't this aspect just
in itself not being alone.

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Just engaging other people and
not being so proud as to say,

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:10.150 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't want to
bore anyone with it.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't them the know I'm
freaking out over this.

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:14.391 align:middle line:84%
We have to be humble
in this situation.

00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Don't we?
-We do.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.580 align:middle line:90%
We have to be humble.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.980 align:middle line:90%
And support is everything.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:23.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge-- you know
it's like we know all this.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And yet I say, oh, well
here's the literature.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We know that friends
make us feel better.

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's an enormous
research literature

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that when we are supported
by other friends,

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.335 align:middle line:84%
we have a stronger
immune system.

00:51:36.335 --> 00:51:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Our cardiovascular
system is better.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Our thinking process is clearer.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:42.701 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and you know
joint creativity.

00:51:42.701 --> 00:51:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Exactly.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.720 align:middle line:84%
That is such a profound
component of this.

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Is just be humble
enough to get together

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:51.010 align:middle line:84%
with your friends or family
members that love you

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and start seeing how-- get
some of their creative input

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.640 align:middle line:84%
as to how you might be able
to fashion yourself if you

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.370 align:middle line:84%
can't see it for yourself.
-Yes, exactly.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is
you've got to put your brain

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.830 align:middle line:90%
in a position to be creative.

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you're sitting around,
and you're depressed.

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know you've got the
squirrel on the wheel going

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.380 align:middle line:84%
around and round and
round, the easiest way

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.501 align:middle line:84%
to get out of it is
to move, to exercise.

00:52:13.501 --> 00:52:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.620 align:middle line:84%
It was turns out that's
almost the panacea

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.010 align:middle line:84%
for depression, for pessimism,
for everything else.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
exercise in nature.

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:24.810 align:middle line:84%
A gym is way better
than nothing.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It's great for you.

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you can combine, you
don't have to be an athlete,

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.920 align:middle line:90%
but walk briskly in nature.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of nature will
draw you into the moment.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Anything that draws
you into the moment

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and out of the
obsessive thinking

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is going to help
you with creativity.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is
another way to do that.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really upset,
most people unless they're

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.510 align:middle line:90%
really skilled meditators--

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:55.505 align:middle line:90%
That's a hard thing to do.

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:56.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a hard thing to do.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.707 align:middle line:84%
Because you are pray
to your mental woes.

00:52:59.707 --> 00:53:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Right and your worry is still
sitting at your side there.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Your worry is there.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk
because we only have--

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.691 align:middle line:84%
Try yoga though.
Move.

00:53:05.691 --> 00:53:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Yoga is great.
I'm with you on that.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Yoga and walking.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
humor for a second.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You like the joke
a day thing, right?

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So really I mean if
you can't meditate,

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.430 align:middle line:84%
then why not go to
a joke a day site?

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can do that.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Or go look up the website of
my good friend Loretta Laroche,

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.130 align:middle line:84%
L.A.R.O.C.H.E. She's
done seven PBS specials.

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:31.800 align:middle line:90%
She's a humorist.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And her field is
positive psychology.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.840 align:middle line:90%
She is just a riot.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And you find, boy,
did my mood change.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And we know, it affects
the brain as well

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.110 align:middle line:90%
as it affects your attitude.

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:43.011 align:middle line:84%
What could be better?
-Yes.

00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:43.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And it gets all those
wonderful neurochemicals going.

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.420 align:middle line:90%
The feel good chemicals.

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about really
the big overlay which is we

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.850 align:middle line:84%
have to have higher
meaning to our lives.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And you touched on it earlier.

00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:57.590 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, Victor Frankl
in the concentration camp

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:04.800 align:middle line:84%
said, he said, this, he
said, this experience,

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.280 align:middle line:84%
if I survive this, I'm
going to go out and teach

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.010 align:middle line:90%
people about resilience.

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make meaning out
of this terrible experience

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.550 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And you know
inadvertently that's what

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.840 align:middle line:90%
I did after my father died.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Because of the side effects
of the cancer treatment.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I have
to make meaning out

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.790 align:middle line:84%
of this if I'm going
to live with it,

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I have to change
the story of it.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that every
single time before I

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:84%
give a lecture on
mind body medicine,

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I dedicate it to my father.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I realize
that without him,

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably still be
working with petri dishes.

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And we all find meaning
in a different way.

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.960 align:middle line:84%
When I go through a difficult
time now, for example,

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.640 align:middle line:84%
I look at it in
terms of OK, I've

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.190 align:middle line:84%
been doing these spiritual
practices for a lifetime.

00:54:58.190 --> 00:55:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting a little
closer to understanding

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:02.780 align:middle line:90%
what surrender is.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a
really good practice.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to practice
surrender here

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.980 align:middle line:84%
to the unfolding future knowing
that I cannot control it.

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And just that very attitude will
change your neural chemistry.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And so much more
you've written about.

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.394 align:middle line:84%
And I want to encourage people
to pick up a copy of this.

00:55:21.394 --> 00:55:22.860 align:middle line:84%
This is a wonderful--
this is a little book,

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.340 align:middle line:90%
but it's packed with wisdom.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And now that everybody's had
a chance to get to know you

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:30.500 align:middle line:84%
a bit, you can see
that you certainly

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:34.811 align:middle line:84%
have I think you've earned
our respect as a guide

00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:35.510 align:middle line:90%
through this.

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I very much appreciate
all the hard work

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.570 align:middle line:90%
you've done in this field.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for bringing this
out in such a wonderful way.

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, my dear.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:56:10.934 align:middle line:90%
