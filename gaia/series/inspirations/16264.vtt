00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, and welcome.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you try to
break an old habit,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:84%
do you ever wonder why
it's so difficult to break?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to learn how to
be more positive and more

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.620 align:middle line:84%
resilient, but you just
don't know how to do that?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if you saw
what it physically

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:84%
looks like in the brain to be
stuck in a specific pattern,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
or even better, what it
looks like in the brain

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to be able to create new
patterns and to create change?

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.422 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:43.380 align:middle line:90%
He is a neuroscientist.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the visionaries
featured on the movie,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:90%
"What the Bleep Do We Know?"

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Happy
to be with you, Lisa.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great to be with you.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We are in for such
a treat today.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.286 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Thank you.

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I want
to ask you, why

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.215 align:middle line:84%
is it so darn
difficult to change?

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.029 align:middle line:90%
Why is change so difficult?

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That seems to
be the biggest question

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.111 align:middle line:90%
that people want to know.

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:90%
And let's define what change is.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Change is to be greater
than your environment,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
to be greater than your body.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.169 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, to
be greater than time.

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say that
you wake up in the morning

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and you do the same things
and you see the same people

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and you go to the same places
and you drink coffee out

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.859 align:middle line:84%
of your same mug, and you
drive to work the same way

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and you see the same
people that push

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:90%
the same emotional buttons.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
We could say that it's
the external environment,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
the outer world, all
the people you know

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and the things that you do
and the places that you go.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Your external environment is
turning on different circuits

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
in your brain causing you to
consciously or unconsciously

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:84%
think equal to
everything that you know.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you react and
think equal to everything

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, you keep creating
more of the same life.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
The principle in
neuroscience says

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
that nerve cells that fire
together, wire together.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep thinking
the same thoughts,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
if you keep performing
the same actions,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:84%
if you keep living
by the same emotions,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
over time the redundancy
of that begins

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to hardwire the brain into
very specific patterns.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And that pattern, then,
becomes our identity

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:90%
or our personality.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There are some
visuals that we're

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.278 align:middle line:84%
going to show in a
little bit that really

00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:90%
made such a huge impact on me.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So now, nerves that fire
together, wire together.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So the actual
nerves, the neurons

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that create
synapses together,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.062 align:middle line:90%
mend together?

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Absolutely.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what a memory is?

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Learning is making new
synaptic connections,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:90%
as we'll see in a minute.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And remembering is
maintaining and sustaining

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:90%
those connections.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So most people, at a
certain point in their life,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:90%
they keep thinking the same way.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
They hardwire their brain
into a certain pattern.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:84%
They keep doing the
same things that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:84%
create habits that become
part of their identity.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And they keep living by
the same emotions that

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
are created from the
same experiences.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And the redundancy
and repetition of that

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
begins to cause the brain to
fire in very finite networks.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes what
we call our identity.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So then by the time
we're 35 years old,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
psychology says that,
for the most part,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
we're a set of
memorized behaviors

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and emotional
reactions that make up

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:90%
who we are as an identity.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes time
to change, and people

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:84%
have to realize that 5%
of their conscious mind

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
is working against
95% of what they've

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:90%
memorized subconsciously.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.709 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So that's
kind of like mind and body

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
working in opposition,
So that becomes

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:84%
very difficult to
change because we're

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
using a very small
percentage to go against what

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:90%
we've subconsciously memorized.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when we
might think of something

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that we want to
change in our lives

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
or we maybe have a new idea
or read a book and say,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:90%
I really want to be like that.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But then you go back
into the same pattern

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and the same habits, it's
nearly impossible to change.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Unless you know
something about it.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
there's a new science

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:90%
emerging called neuroplasticity.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And neuroplasticity
says that you're

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:84%
in fact changed biologically
by every thought you think.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Every new thing you learn, every
new experience that you create,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
every new choice that you make,
every new dream that you dream,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.615 align:middle line:84%
your brain begins to fire in
new sequences and new patterns

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:90%
and new combinations.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you make the
brain work differently,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
you're changing your
mind because mind

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:90%
is the brain in action.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So most people then, at a
certain point in their life,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
they stop learning and
they start feeling.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And when feelings become
the barometer for change,

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
we'll always talk
ourselves out of greatness.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.379 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
change, it means

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to have to come out

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.031 align:middle line:84%
of your resting
state, number one.

00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And number two,
you're going to have

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:90%
to feel a little uncomfortable.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So the moment we start to
feel uncomfortable most people

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:84%
go, ooh, I want to return back
to that familiar identity.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even if it's painful.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.863 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:04:45.863 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So here's how it
works physiologically.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:10%
If you have a thought, every
time you have a thought,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:10%
you make a chemical
in your brain.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:10%
If you have a great thought
or an unlimited thought,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:10%
you turn on a set of
circuits in your brain

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:10%
in a very specific
sequence and pattern

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:10%
that produces a
level of mind that

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:10%
signals another part
of your brain for you

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:10%
to begin to feel exactly the
way you were just thinking,

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:10%
great or unlimited.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:84%
If you have a negative
thought or an unhappy thought,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:84%
you turn on a different
set of neural networks

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
in a different
combination and sequence

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that produces a different
level of mind that

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
turns on a different
blend of chemicals for you

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to feel exactly the way
you were just thinking,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:90%
negative or unhappy.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.777 align:middle line:84%
Now the moment you begin
to feel the way you think,

00:05:24.777 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
because the brain is in constant
communication with your body,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
you begin to think
the way you feel.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to feel the
way you think and think

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:84%
the way you feel and
feel the way you think.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And the cycle of thinking and
feeling over time conditions

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:84%
the body to memorize
that emotion

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.792 align:middle line:90%
better than the conscious mind.

00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:42.666 align:middle line:84%
Whenever the body knows
better than the mind,

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:90%
that's called a habit.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Habit is when the
body is the mind.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the
chicken or the egg.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not the body
the controls the mind

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
or the mind that
controls the body.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.373 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: No, it's
a state of being.

00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when mind and
body are working together,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:90%
that's called a state of being.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, thoughts are the
language of the brain

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and feelings are the
language of the body.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to think
and feel in a certain cycle,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.650 align:middle line:90%
you create a state of being.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Now as I said, 95% of who we are
by the time we're 35 years old

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.749 align:middle line:84%
is a set of memorized behaviors
in which it's subconsciously

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
running behind the
scenes of our awareness.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Here's a great example.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You can't consciously
remember a phone number.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.294 align:middle line:84%
Well, you'd have to
be over 35 for this.

00:06:21.294 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
You can't consciously
remember a phone number,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
but you walk over to the
receiver and you pick it up

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the dial pad and
your fingers dial the number.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't remember
your ATM number,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
but your fingers
can remember it.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So you've practiced
it so many times

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
that your body knows
better than your brain.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Now 95% of who we are by
the time we're 35 years old

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
are those set of
memorized subconscious

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.092 align:middle line:90%
automatic programs.

00:06:45.092 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that's
why you said 35.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So by 35 we've pretty
much figured it all out

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
neurologically,
become hardwired.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So now the person wants
to think positively,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
but they've been
feeling negatively

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:90%
for the last 25 years.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
They want to create
a new life and create

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:84%
a new vision for themselves,
but they feel guilty.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.050 align:middle line:10%
That's mind and body
working in opposition.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
We have to recondition
the body to a new mind.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And when the body
becomes the mind then,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:84%
when I said to change is to
think greater than the body.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.650 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that is
we have to think greater

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
than the memorized emotions
that the body has recognized

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:90%
or become familiar with.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So then these days people
are under an enormous amount

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:84%
of stress, not only because of
the current economic situation

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's because of the
information and the technology

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
age speeding things up faster
and faster, constantly feeling

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:90%
or distracted.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So what does stress do
to the mind and the body?

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Mm.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, stress
is when the body's

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:90%
knocked out of balance.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you're being chased by
a lion thousands of years ago,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
you turned on a
primitive nervous system

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to mobilize all of this energy
to prepare you for some threat

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
or event in your
external environment.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you mobilize all that
energy, you're really saying,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I've got to take
care of this body.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I've got to become
aware of my environment

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and how much time do
I have to get there.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So what was once
highly adaptive,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.547 align:middle line:84%
which means if you're
being chased by a lion,

00:08:11.547 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
you'd better make sure
that you have enough energy

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:90%
to either fight or run.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But now if you're thinking
about firing an employee,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and you know that this
person has a wife that's sick

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and they have four children,
and you know that they actually

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
need the job more than the other
person who's going to stay,

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to think about
that over and over again,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:84%
you're turning on the stress
response just by thought alone.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And what was once
highly adaptive

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
now becomes very maladaptive.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Because no organism in nature
can survive under long term

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:90%
stress.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Long term stress.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There was a movie that
you were in, which was great.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
It's called, "The People
v. The State Of Illusion."

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Really, really well done movie.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
have a clip of it

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that I want to show that
illustrates or talks

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about the long
term stress effects in the body.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.384 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:10%
>>According to the American
Psychological Association,

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:10%
over 50% of deaths
in the United States

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:10%
can be attributed to
behavioral or social factors,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:10%
the majority of which
are rooted in stress.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:10%
Stress damages the immune
system and contributes

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:10%
to the onset of many diseases.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:10%
>>A major problem I
think people have today

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:10%
is they're exhausted.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:10%
The term stress is used a lot.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:10%
They're stressed out.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:84%
They think things are about
moving faster and faster

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:90%
and doing more and more.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
When people often
think about stress,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking about
something out there

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:90%
that's causing their stress.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Their boss is
being mean to them,

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
their kids aren't picking
up their cell phone.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, I think the
real stress has to do with,

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
as I've studied it over the
years, it's internally created.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Most people live in stress.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:10%
And when we live in stress,
we live in survival.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:10%
Stress is when the
body's knocked out

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:10%
of normal homeostasis, when it's
knocked out of normal balance.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:84%
The stress response
is what the body

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:84%
does innately to return
itself back to order.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So most organisms in nature are
designed for short term stress,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a beaver, a
rabbit, a giraffe, a fly.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Every single organism
has the ability

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to
environmental conditions

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and produce a chemical change
to deal with emergency.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And so short term
stress is pretty much

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
a function of survival.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.161 align:middle line:84%
There is something called
the long term stress,

00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and that is that when the
body keeps being knocked out

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:84%
of balance and it doesn't have a
chance to return back to order.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds of
different stressors:

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle line:84%
traffic jams, internet
connections, second mortgages,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.370 align:middle line:90%
single parenting.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And all of those reactions
to the environment

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:84%
produce the same
physiological response

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that produces
stressful conditions.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:84%
What makes us so
unique is that we

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
can make thought more
real than anything else.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the privilege
of being a human being.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:10%
Because we can begin to
think about an event,

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:10%
we can put our
awareness in the future

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:10%
and begin to forecast or
expect something to happen.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:10%
Because we can make thought
more real than anything

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:10%
else, the moment we
do that, we begin

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:10%
to turn on the stress
response in the body

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:10%
just by thought alone.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:10%
And the repetition
of that over time

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:10%
keeps the body out of balance,
and that chronic stress then

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:10%
causes us to head for disease.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.637 align:middle line:10%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:29.637 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're not seeing the
lion and the tiger any longer,

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
but we're seeing the
traffic and we're

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
experiencing texting
while we're driving.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.837 align:middle line:84%
Are those still considered
long term constant stressors?

00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, what
it is is that there's

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.760 align:middle line:84%
nothing wrong with having
emotional reactions to things

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty much part of life.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the repetition
of those that

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:90%
keep the body out of balance.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, your body is
your unconscious mind.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It does not know the
difference between a stressor

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
in your environment
that produces

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
a reaction and the thoughts
that you think that produce

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:90%
the same physiological response.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So the body, it thinks
it's in the same experience

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And so if you keep
mobilizing all

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
of this energy for some threat
that's real or imagined,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
there's no energy then
for internal repair.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
There's no energy for
growth and repair.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And so if two cancer
cells get together

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and they want to start
a family or a community,

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:84%
all of the troops
are fighting a war

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:90%
in the external environment.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.205 align:middle line:84%
There's no energy
for growth and repair

00:12:31.205 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:90%
in the internal environment.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's heart
disease, whether it's

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
immune mediated
conditions, whether it's

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
muscle pain, whether it's
digestive disturbances,

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
whether it's memory
problems, infertility,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:84%
it's all created by
those hormones of stress.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Because as the body is living
in that emergency mode,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
there's no real need for
long term building projects.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's no
downtime for repair.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.275 align:middle line:84%
There's no time for relaxation
in that environment,

00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:84%
in that constant
state of stress.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.483 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it just in terms

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
of the amount of energy
that we have available,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
it's an interesting phenomenon
because those chemicals

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:90%
of stress are highly addictive.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.682 align:middle line:90%
They give us a rush of energy.

00:13:13.682 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are they?

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And we
begin to associate

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
the problems and the conditions
in our life with feeling alive.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So we begin to subconsciously
keep the problems--

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:84%
the bad relationships, the bad
jobs-- in our external world

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
to reaffirm our emotional
addiction so we can remember

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:90%
who we are as a somebody.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we get addicted
to the adrenaline rush

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
from the stress so we stay
in the bad relationship

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.150 align:middle line:84%
or we stay in the bad job or we
stay in the stress environment.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: At least
it's predictable.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.911 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:90%
It keeps us in our comfort zone.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.128 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a
clip that we have

00:13:46.128 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:84%
that shows the
physiological response

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:90%
that stress has in the body.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.689 align:middle line:84%
And this is ultimately what
leads to 90% of disease.

00:13:53.689 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Actually 95%.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard
it in different ways.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.897 align:middle line:90%
90% to 95% of disease.

00:13:57.897 --> 00:13:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.622 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So here's an
example where you see a lion.

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:07.080 align:middle line:84%
You're going to turn on the
fight or flight nervous system.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
But you could see
your mother-in-law

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and you could have
the same reaction.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Or you could begin to
auto suggest and think

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:90%
about the problems in your life.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And in all three
cases, you're turning

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
on that sympathetic
nervous system.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you turn on this
primitive nervous system,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:84%
you have to mobilize energy
to prepare you for some threat

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
so that your body can
adapt to those conditions.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So the signal travels
down to the adrenal glands

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:90%
through the spinal cord.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The adrenal glands squirt out a
bunch of adrenalin and adrenal

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
hormones, and you get
this rush of energy.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:84%
You become super aware
for a few moments.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Your pupils dilate.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Your salivary juices
begin to shut down.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.885 align:middle line:84%
As a result, your heart rate
and your respiratory rate

00:14:49.885 --> 00:14:52.135 align:middle line:84%
begin to increase because
you're either going to fight

00:14:52.135 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to run.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And blood is sent
to your extremities.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the
fight or flight response.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Now the difficulty with this
is that in the long term,

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:84%
there's no energy for
you to do anything else.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this really
makes it clear about how

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.682 align:middle line:84%
patterns that we get stuck
into are difficult to break.

00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The very first thing
that I started with,

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.122 align:middle line:90%
why is change so difficult?

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment you--
let's say for, as an example,

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle line:84%
you have been caught in
this cycle of thinking

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and feeling and feeling
and thinking like a victim,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
or suffering, because you had
an experience 20 years ago.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And after that experience,
you have an event in your life

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:84%
that produces an
emotional reaction.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:10%
Now what most
people don't know is

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:10%
that when you have an
emotional reaction,

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.060 align:middle line:10%
there's a refractory
period of chemicals

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:10%
that are created that are
connected to that experience.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
feelings and emotions

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:84%
are the end product
of past experiences.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So if people don't
know how to control

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
their emotional
reactions and they

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
allow that refractory period
to run for hours or days,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.059 align:middle line:90%
that's called a mood.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So what's wrong with you?

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.377 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm in a mood.

00:16:02.377 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, why are you in a mood?

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, this thing happened
to me five days ago,

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'm memorizing my
emotional reaction.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Now if you keep that same
refractory period going

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:84%
for weeks or months, that's
called a temperament.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.265 align:middle line:90%
So you say, why is he so angry?

00:16:18.265 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And you say, why
are you so angry?

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, this thing
happened to me 11 months ago.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Same refractory period
that's going on and on.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Now if you keep it
going for years on end,

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:84%
that's called a
personality trait.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So by very definition,
our personality

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is completely
connected to our past.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we live by the same
emotions every single day,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and those emotions are
driving our thoughts,

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
we're literally
thinking in the past.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And every time we recall
that event from the past,

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:84%
we produce the same chemistry
in the brain and the body

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:90%
as if the event was happening.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.992 align:middle line:84%
Now if you keep circulating
the same chemicals,

00:16:53.992 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
condition your body

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
to memorize that emotion better
than your conscious mind.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Now let's suppose the person
has a moment of illumination

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:90%
and they say, oh my gosh.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.329 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm not going to complain,
I'm not going to make excuses,

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to feel
sorry for myself.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to live
by this emotional state.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to break
that chemical continuity that's

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:90%
become so familiar to them.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They're going to stop firing
the same thoughts in their brain

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that are hardwired
and they're going

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.328 align:middle line:84%
to stop sending the
same emotional chemicals

00:17:22.328 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:84%
to their body that
they've memorized.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So but then
it's more than just

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.569 align:middle line:90%
changing it in your mind.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
You're combating a physical,
chemical, body, cellular memory

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:90%
reaction.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.683 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:17:32.683 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you interrupt
that chemical continuity,

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
the body, which has
become the mind,

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:84%
begins to send signals
back to the brain.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So you started out with
really good intentions,

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
two hours go by

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden the cells
of the body get together

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.425 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey.

00:17:48.425 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
We've modified
our receptor sites

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.194 align:middle line:84%
to receive more
chemicals of guilt.

00:17:52.194 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
sudden you're going

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:90%
to stop after 20 years of this?

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So the body sends a signal back
up the central nervous system.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:90%
I call that the fast track.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
chemical levels,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
those peptides that we
produce that are feelings,

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
begin to drop because you're
no longer feeling suffering.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden the
thermostat in the brain

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
called the hypothalamus
notices that circulating

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:84%
levels of suffering
is going down.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So it sends a signal back
to the thinking brain

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:90%
that's called the slow track.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.823 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know, you start

00:18:20.823 --> 00:18:23.722 align:middle line:84%
to hear these sub
vocalizations in your head.

00:18:23.722 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:90%
That chatter, you know?

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
That awfulizing that
starts saying, like,

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.549 align:middle line:90%
maybe you should start tomorrow.

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow would be a better day.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Or ooh, this doesn't feel right.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Ew.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it starts
to defend itself.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.213 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
the body as the mind

00:18:36.213 --> 00:18:38.295 align:middle line:84%
says, where've you been
for the last 20 years?

00:18:38.295 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:90%
I've been running the show.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
You think you've been
running the show,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:90%
and now you're going to change?

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:90%
We can't have this.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And so the body, when I say
the change must be greater

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:84%
than the body, I
literally mean that you

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
have to overcome the chatter
and the voices in your head.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment you respond
to that voice as if it's true,

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.350 align:middle line:84%
consciousness immerses
itself back into the program.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And we return back to
the same personality,

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
thinking the same thoughts,
performing the same actions,

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
living by the same emotions,
and really expecting

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.580 align:middle line:84%
something different
to happen in our life.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.996 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Eating the
same bad foods,

00:19:09.996 --> 00:19:12.470 align:middle line:84%
going back to the smoking
habit, addiction, addiction.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So is this the same
thing for, say,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.186 align:middle line:84%
an addiction to
alcohol or to drugs?

00:19:17.186 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
think about this, OK?

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that a
person has an event

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:90%
in their life many years prior.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're branded emotionally
from that experience.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And they can't get
beyond the experience

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
any longer because
they're emotionally

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.450 align:middle line:90%
living by that same state.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they got knocked
out of balance some time ago.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And so now the person now all
of the sudden is going to say,

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I've got to make
this feeling go away.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know how
to change it inside of me,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to look for
something outside of me that's

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:90%
going to make it go away.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.151 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To numb it.

00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now, drugs
or alcohol or shopping

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
or gambling or pornography
or video gaming or overeating

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
or undereating, all
of that stuff produces

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
an immediate internal
chemical change.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you notice
that that pain goes away,

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
you pay attention to whatever
or whoever caused that.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And that event, in and of
itself, that association

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:90%
is called a memory.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we begin to
associate, unconsciously,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
things in our outside
environment that make that pain

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:90%
go away.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the problem.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Every time the person
gambles or shops

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
or video games, their pleasure
centers in their brain

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:84%
start going higher and higher,
recalibrating to a higher level

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
because the receptor sites
on the outside of the cells

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:90%
become desensitized.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So the next time you
gamble, the next time you

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:84%
shop, the next time
you use a drug, you

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:84%
need a little bit more to
turn on those receptor sites.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.459 align:middle line:84%
It's like living with a spouse
that always yells at you.

00:20:47.459 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They have to yell
a little bit louder

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
to get your attention because
you've become desensitized.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So now the pleasure
centers become

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:84%
re-calibrated to
such a high level

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.862 align:middle line:84%
that in the absence
of that stimulation,

00:20:58.862 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:84%
people don't feel any pleasure
from anything in their life.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So then they're looking
for some immediate way

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to take that pain away because
they don't know that it really

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:90%
has to happen from within them.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So behind every
substance addiction,

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:84%
there's usually an
emotion that we've

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:84%
memorized that's become
part of our identity

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
how to change.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So the survival emotions,
when you're knocked out

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
of homeostasis,
knocked out of balance,

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the emotions of anger
and aggression and hatred

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and judgment and fear and
anxiety and insecurity

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and hopelessness and
powerlessness, depression,

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.675 align:middle line:84%
those altered states of
consciousness I call them,

00:21:36.675 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
are pretty much the normal
states of consciousness.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But they're all driven by
the hormones of stress.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.616 align:middle line:84%
So to follow this,
there was again,

00:21:43.616 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
in the movie you
did, "The People

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
v. The State of Illusion"
by Austin Vickers--

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
great movie-- it sets
this up a little bit more.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.889 align:middle line:84%
It shows a little
bit more of what

00:21:52.889 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Joe was just talking about.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.954 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:21:55.954 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.937 align:middle line:10%
>>The person who memorizes
a great golf swing and they

00:22:00.937 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:10%
put all their attention
on it and they practice it

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.474 align:middle line:10%
over and over again, over and
over again, over time that

00:22:05.474 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:10%
swing will become
more and more natural.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:10%
That's the beauty of
being a human being.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:10%
By the same means,
the person who

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:10%
practices suffering and
thinks of all the reasons

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:10%
to complain in their
life and judges others,

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.310 align:middle line:10%
complains and blames and
makes excuses and feels sorry

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.220 align:middle line:10%
for themself, they're doing the
same exact thing neurologically

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:10%
as the person who's
mastering the golf swing

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:10%
or mastering different
states of mind.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:10%
The principle is
absolutely the same.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:10%
The effects are different
based on the levels of mind.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:10%
So the repetition
over time not only

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:10%
makes the neurons
begin to function

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:10%
in more hardwired
patterns, but they

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:10%
begin to accommodate
and form more

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.590 align:middle line:10%
stronger connections,
thicker circuits

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:10%
to reflect who and where we are.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:10%
We are all masters.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:10%
The question is, what
have you memorized

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:10%
so well that your
internal order is greater

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:10%
than any external
condition in your life?

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:10%
>>Even when we become aware of
these destructive emotional and

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:10%
perceptual patterns,
breaking out of them

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:10%
and thinking and
perceiving in new ways

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.570 align:middle line:10%
requires an effort much like
the one an alcoholic or drug

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:10%
addict must go through to break
the habit of these addictions.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So we've really
stated the case here

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.150 align:middle line:84%
of what stress is in the body,
what the chemical reactions are

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:84%
from the body that sends
the signals to the brain.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.545 align:middle line:90%
How do we break this cycle?

00:23:27.545 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:90%
How does the brain change?

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.110 align:middle line:84%
How does it actually
get out of this pattern?

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, there's
a principle in neuroscience

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:84%
that also says that nerve cells
that no longer fire together

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:90%
no longer wire together.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to inhibit the most
common thoughts or attitudes

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:84%
that you've had that
you've wired in your brain,

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to pay
attention and observe

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:84%
those behaviors that
you've demonstrated over

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and over again, and as you
begin to notice and become aware

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.757 align:middle line:84%
of your emotional
states, we turn

00:23:57.757 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:84%
on a part of the brain
called the forebrain,

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
the frontal lobe,
which is really

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:84%
the crowning achievement
of the human being.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And this mindfulness,
or what we call

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
in neuroscience metacognition
that we can pay attention

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:84%
to who we're being, it means
that we can modify our behavior

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:90%
to do a better job in life.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So as people begin to
observe those programs,

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.120 align:middle line:84%
it means now that they're
no longer the program.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:84%
They're the consciousness
observing the program.

by observing them.

00:24:24.942 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Start by observing,
because it means then

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to observe
it and participate in it,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:84%
then you're no longer
causing the neurons

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:90%
to fire in the same patterns.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't cause
them to communicate just

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
like any relationship, if
you break your communication,

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.057 align:middle line:90%
you break your bond.

00:24:42.057 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As I'd learned
from your book,

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that frontal lobe is responsible
for about 40% of the brain?

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:48.661 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:24:48.661 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's a large
part of the brain.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's what separates
us from most other species.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It's the CEO of the brain.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we can
modify our behaviors

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
to do a better job
in life, it means

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
we can evolve our actions
to become somebody else.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Now we have three brains
in one, three brains that

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
allow us to go from
thinking to doing to being.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Now your thinking brain
is called your neocortex.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.960 align:middle line:84%
That's that walnut that sits
on the outside with the folds

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and valleys.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is the seat of
your conscious awareness.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Every time you
learn something new,

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:84%
you make a new connection
in your thinking brain.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.789 align:middle line:90%
That's what learning is.

00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:90%
Making those connections.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So you read the book on
how to ride a bicycle,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:84%
you read the book on
how to dance the salsa,

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
you read a book on how
to build a doghouse,

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:84%
you read a book on success,
how to be a better parent.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:84%
You read a book on
compassion and forgiveness.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of this information is
stored in your thinking brain.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you make connections.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It's philosophy though.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:90%
It's theory.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:90%
It's intellectual data.

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.126 align:middle line:90%
It's facts.

00:25:52.126 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:84%
It's all stored in
your thinking brain.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Now when you take
that information

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and you apply it, if
you personalize it,

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
if you demonstrate
it, it means you're

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.399 align:middle line:84%
going to have to modify
your behavior in some way.

00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:06.440 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
do something differently.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Physiologically.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: If you
change your behavior,

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
get your behaviors to match
your intentions or your actions

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:90%
equal to your thoughts.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:84%
If you get mind and
body working together,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a new experience.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Now the moment you
have a new experience,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.600 align:middle line:84%
you activate the second
brain called the limbic brain

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:84%
or the chemical brain
or the emotional bring.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Now let me explain.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the
midst of an experience,

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:84%
everything you're seeing
and smelling and tasting

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and feeling and hearing,
all of your five senses

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:90%
plug you into the environment.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you're gathering
all this sensory data

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:84%
from your external world,
all that information's

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:84%
rushing back to your brain
through five sensory pathways.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
The moment all that
information reaches your brain,

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
jungles of neurons begin
to organize themselves

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
into pattern to
reflect the event.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.080 align:middle line:84%
The moment they string into
place, the limbic brain

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.925 align:middle line:84%
or the emotional brain
releases a chemical.

00:26:57.925 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And that chemical's
called a feeling.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So feelings and emotions
are the end product

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:90%
of past experiences.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And we can remember
experiences better

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:84%
because we can
remember how they felt.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So you can remember
where you were on 9/11.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:84%
You can tell me who you
were with, the time of day

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:90%
it was, what you were doing.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You can tell me everything
about that moment.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Because everything you were
seeing and hearing and feeling,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
it changed your
internal chemistry

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and caused your
brain to wake up,

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and you paid attention
to what caused it.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you read the book on
compassion as an example,

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and you read it three times, and
you have all this information

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
wired in your
thinking neocortex,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and you could run around your
life and say to your friends,

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, you need to
be more compassionate

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:90%
and you need to forgive more.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is you're
basically espousing philosophy.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.931 align:middle line:84%
But then if you get a call
from your spouse and he says,

00:27:50.931 --> 00:27:51.430 align:middle line:90%
listen.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to go to
dinner with my mother.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And you don't like
your mother-in-law.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's now where
the rubber meets the road.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Because if you pull over
on the side of the road

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden you notice
those unconscious thoughts,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to pay attention
to those impulsive behaviors,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and you start to notice the
feelings that you're feeling.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And as you pull over on the side
of the road and you say, OK.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Let me restrain these thoughts,
behaviors, and emotions.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to observe those
states of mind and body,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
you're actually turning
on the frontal lobe.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And the frontal
lobe is beginning

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:84%
to quiet down the
circuits in your brain

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.260 align:middle line:84%
that are connected
to the old self.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And if nerve cells that
no longer fire together

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.540 align:middle line:84%
no longer wire together, you're
turning off that level of mind.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Now if you said, let me see.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:90%
What did the book say?

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it said to
see myself in her.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I'll try that out.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it said to stay present
and not hold her to the past.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
sit there and think

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
about a new way of
being, you would

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:84%
begin to cause
your brain to fire

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.030 align:middle line:90%
in new sequences, new patterns.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you make the
brain work differently,

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.540 align:middle line:90%
you're changing your mind.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Mind is the brain in action.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So as you begin to rehearse
mentally a new way of being,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time
you take that knowledge

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and you put yourself
into the equation,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to think
about a new way of being,

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
not only are you making
the brain work in new ways,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:84%
but nerve cells that fire
together, wire together.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:84%
You're beginning to install
the neurological hardware

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.302 align:middle line:84%
in your brain to have some
circuits in place to use when

00:29:31.302 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:84%
you go to dinner with
your mother-in-law.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So does it have
to be an event that

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.785 align:middle line:84%
requires the sensing
and the thinking

00:29:37.785 --> 00:29:40.710 align:middle line:90%
and the feeling and the hearing?

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.602 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's a reason why
you remember a bad birthday as

00:29:43.602 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:84%
opposed to a really
great birthday,

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
because it fires in the
body chemically different.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So rather than just reading
the book on compassion,

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.731 align:middle line:84%
you actually have to practice
it in a heightened state

00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:56.606 align:middle line:84%
so that you're using
all five senses in order

00:29:56.606 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:90%
for it to change?

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You don't actually
have to use your five senses,

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.170 align:middle line:90%
but here's the caveat.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:10%
Let's just say now you
walk into the dinner

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:10%
with your mother-in-law and
you've cultivated a new mind

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:10%
because you sat on the side
of the road for 45 minutes

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:10%
and got your mind and
body working together.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You began to fire and wire
new circuits in your brain.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And you stopped the chemicals
from running to your body

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.911 align:middle line:84%
and you began to think
about a new way of being,

00:30:19.911 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and you started to
think about compassion.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.254 align:middle line:84%
And you walk in there and
you get your behaviors

00:30:24.254 --> 00:30:26.170 align:middle line:84%
to match your intentions,
you get your actions

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:26.990 align:middle line:90%
equal to your thoughts.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
You get your mind and
body working together,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and you do exactly
what the book says,

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.083 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting in the
presence of your mother-in-law

00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, you
start to feel compassion.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.630 align:middle line:84%
The moment you begin
to feel compassion,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:90%
you turn on that limbic brain.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Now you're teaching
your body chemically.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:84%
You're instructing
it chemically so

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that it learns what your mind
has intellectually understood.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, knowledge is for the mind,
but experience is for the body.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you
feel compassion, now

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:90%
you're embodying knowledge.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:90%
The word is becoming flesh.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:84%
You begin to signal
new genes and new ways,

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to change
your very state of being.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have a whole clip

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:90%
So I want to explain.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
this is a good clip

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:84%
of just showing
the three brains.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:84%
That yellow brain that
sits on the outside

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is your thinking
bring, your neocortex.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Right underneath that,
about the size of a lemon,

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
is your emotional brain or
chemical brain or limbic brain

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:90%
or mid brain.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And that red brain in the back
is called your being brain,

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:32.270 align:middle line:84%
which we'll talk
about right now.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a
state of being, it

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:84%
means that your mind and
body are working as one.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So you can't forgive your
mother-in-law or show

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.440 align:middle line:84%
compassion one time and expect
to be put on the stained glass

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.050 align:middle line:90%
windows in church.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to replicate
it over and over again.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.146 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, for it
to make a difference.

00:31:50.146 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And when you can
do it over and over again,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:84%
you will begin to
neurochemically condition

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.942 align:middle line:84%
your body to memorize compassion
as well as your conscious mind.

00:32:00.942 --> 00:32:02.400 align:middle line:84%

that really show how
this works in the brain.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones that
made a massive impact on me.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:84%

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.370 align:middle line:90%
begin to work together.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.980 align:middle line:84%
You activate that third
brain called the cerebellum.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the seat of
your subconscious.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:84%
When you are in
a state of being,

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.920 align:middle line:84%
your mind and body
are working together.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And we could say that you've
memorized an internal chemical

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:84%
order that no person, no thing,
no experience outside of you

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:90%
can move you from it.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
that state of being,

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.700 align:middle line:84%
now we're mastering
that information.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming wisdom.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And now that state of
compassion is innate.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.340 align:middle line:90%
It's in us.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And then when we're
in that state,

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:84%
then the environment
is no longer

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
controlling how
we think and feel.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Now how we think and
feel is beginning

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.380 align:middle line:90%
to affect our environment.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this could
happen at any age.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:01.880 align:middle line:90%
You can do this at any point.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Absolutely.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is what change is.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And we were talking
about the golf swing earlier.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.438 align:middle line:90%
That's a great example.

00:33:06.438 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But let's take it to
more altruistic measures.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about compassion
or forgiveness or success

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:90%
or wealth.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.011 align:middle line:84%
It works the same
exact way for anything.

00:33:17.011 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Learning first,
then you get the thinking brain.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.369 align:middle line:84%
Then you perform the action,
you get your behaviors

00:33:23.369 --> 00:33:24.410 align:middle line:90%
to match your intentions.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.930 align:middle line:84%
You embody that information,
then it becomes innate.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.015 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
state where it's in you,

00:33:29.015 --> 00:33:32.160 align:middle line:84%
it's who you are, then you
can say, I am successful.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:90%
I am compassionate.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:34.400 align:middle line:90%
I am patient.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Because your mind and
body are working together,

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.972 align:middle line:84%
and it's no longer a
philosophical concept.

00:33:38.972 --> 00:33:39.930 align:middle line:90%
You know that you know.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:42.263 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's see what
it looks like in the brain.

00:33:42.263 --> 00:33:44.280 align:middle line:84%
What does it physically
look like in the brain?

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so
this is a clip of--

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So
this is two neurons

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that have developed a
long term relationship.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.920 align:middle line:84%
They've fired and
wired together,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and now they're hardwired
into a very specific pattern.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.320 align:middle line:84%
You can show the
next one, too, here.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Again, the moment they're
in a long term relationship,

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
they've become a
hardwired set of circuits

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that could be related to
joy or pain or unhappiness,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.250 align:middle line:84%
but it looks exactly
the same in the brain.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So tell me what these
are that we're looking at.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Two neurons.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Two neurons that have
been connected or synapsed

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.850 align:middle line:84%
so that now they're
exchanging information.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And neurons, they possess
the unique ability

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
to store and communicate
information between each other,

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.730 align:middle line:90%
and they're electrochemical.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when you fire
a thought, information

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.699 align:middle line:84%
is traveling electrochemically
from one neuron to the next.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And when it passes from
one neuron to the next,

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.022 align:middle line:84%
it's exchanging information, and
that creates a state of mind.

00:34:43.022 --> 00:34:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it does that
through neuropeptides,

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
those chains are?

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:49.805 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: No, it actually does
it through neurotransmitters.

00:34:49.805 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:84%
Neurotransmitters
are the primary thing

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that allow neurons to
communicate between each other.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Neuropeptides tend to be
what signals the brain

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.890 align:middle line:84%
to the body that
begins to turn on

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of the third set of
chemicals called hormones.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.602 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:02.602 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:90%
This is so fascinating.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.990 align:middle line:84%
This footage to me,
really-- and I'm

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.786 align:middle line:84%
sure it wakes up a
lot of people to see

00:35:07.786 --> 00:35:09.035 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in our bodies.

00:35:09.035 --> 00:35:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So the next clip is
again, showing this.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now this is
learning in the brain.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Every time you learn something
new, your brain does this.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Learning is making
new connections.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.744 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter what
you're learning,

00:35:21.744 --> 00:35:23.410 align:middle line:84%
but if you're paying
attention, there'll

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:84%
come a moment where those
neurons will begin to connect.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And that, when it
happens then, you've

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:32.210 align:middle line:84%
began to change
yourself biologically.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.244 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It reminds
me of the footage

00:35:34.244 --> 00:35:35.910 align:middle line:84%
of the finger that
connects at the ends.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:37.064 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:37.064 --> 00:35:37.980 align:middle line:90%
It's really wonderful.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I think
there's a hidden meaning.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There is.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that's literally
what new memories are like.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's exactly
what new memories are like.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're learning anything
from what we're talking about,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
you're changing
biologically just like that.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now at the same time
that those new memories are

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.687 align:middle line:84%
forming, you could
also break those

00:35:55.687 --> 00:35:59.122 align:middle line:84%
by-- And that's what breaking an
old pattern looks like, right?

00:35:59.122 --> 00:35:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to inhibit,
they begin to pull apart.

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have a
clip of that coming up.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Now
again, here we go.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Two neurons.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I call this the aha phenomenon.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.540 align:middle line:84%
One whole neural
network connecting

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.104 align:middle line:90%
to another whole neural network.

00:36:15.104 --> 00:36:16.520 align:middle line:84%
In the brain, the
sum of the parts

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.740 align:middle line:90%
is greater than the whole.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.940 align:middle line:84%
You get that aha moment where
you say, and now I understand.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
connection that is made.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.016 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's
absolutely biological.

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:28.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Biological
connections that are made.

00:36:28.535 --> 00:36:32.320 align:middle line:84%
When you experience that
connecting and making

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.340 align:middle line:84%
a new pattern happen or a
memory connect or something

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.850 align:middle line:84%
positive in the brain, that's
literally what it's doing.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:39.641 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's
exactly what it's doing.

00:36:39.641 --> 00:36:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's what
can also create healing?

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It can begin
to create or cultivate

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:84%
a level of mind that
ultimately can lead to healing.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you say that
the body has the innate ability

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to want to heal and
achieve homeostasis,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.350 align:middle line:90%
that's what it looks like.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, let's
just say that if you're

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:02.810 align:middle line:84%
thinking and feeling in the
same cycle for years on end,

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.010 align:middle line:84%
we could say that those
emotions are driving

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:84%
those neural networks
in your brain

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:84%
that reaffirm the level
of mind, that create

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.552 align:middle line:84%
the same chemicals, that signal
the same genes, that keep you

00:37:12.552 --> 00:37:13.510 align:middle line:90%
in this state of being.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:16.655 align:middle line:84%
Now genes are like
on and off switches.

00:37:16.655 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:90%
They love information.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Cells love information.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you are in that
same cycle over time,

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.509 align:middle line:84%
you keep the same
gene signaled on

00:37:24.509 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:90%
and the other genes turned off.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:30.537 align:middle line:84%
So if you're living by the state
of resentment for 35 years,

00:37:30.537 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and you don't even know that
those thoughts are slipping

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.460 align:middle line:84%
by your awareness because
they're unconscious now

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and you're demonstrating
what resentment

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.846 align:middle line:84%
looks like in every area of your
life, so you're acting that way

00:37:39.846 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and you're feeling it.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Then over time,
you're going to keep

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.884 align:middle line:84%
pushing the same
genetic button that's

00:37:44.884 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:90%
going to create the disease.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And not even know it.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Not even know it.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.803 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be happening
behind the scenes

00:37:49.803 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:90%
of your awareness.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So then the person says, well,
I'm going to think positively.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Well first of all, you've
got to get in touch with all

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.270 align:middle line:84%
those subconscious
or unconscious,

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:84%
go into the operating
system of the subconscious

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and bring them to your awareness
so that they would never

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:84%
slip by unconsciously
by you again.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So the moment a person
surrenders those emotions

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that are signaling
the same gene,

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.270 align:middle line:84%
well, it begins to biologically
break in the brain,

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.570 align:middle line:84%
but then it no longer signals
the same gene in the same way,

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and the body begins to become
free from the emotional chains

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.132 align:middle line:90%
that keep it in the same state.

00:38:25.132 --> 00:38:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said
we had a clip that

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.810 align:middle line:84%
showed how a
pattern gets broken.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if we've got that.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: This is
another little neuron

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.805 align:middle line:90%
connecting with another neuron.

00:38:36.805 --> 00:38:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can't see enough
of that, by the way.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.325 align:middle line:90%
That's just fascinating to me.

00:38:40.325 --> 00:38:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And
this is real time

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.360 align:middle line:84%
by the way, which
makes it very cool.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.910 align:middle line:84%
That's how fast it can
happen in the brain.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.167 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is interesting.

00:38:46.167 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.515 align:middle line:84%
So that's how it just
takes a matter of seconds.

00:38:49.515 --> 00:38:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah,
and children's brains

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.330 align:middle line:84%
do this way better than
adults, believe it or not.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because there's
less clutter in there?

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: They're
so neuroplastic.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.499 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very
elastic brains.

00:38:58.499 --> 00:38:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's see this one.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:90%
I think this is change.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:90%
So here, look.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Your person's unhooking
from the old cell,

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.160 align:middle line:84%
unhooking from the old memory,
and literally reconnecting

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.225 align:middle line:90%
to a new self.

00:39:08.225 --> 00:39:10.447 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The unhooking--

00:39:10.447 --> 00:39:11.405 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Is the key.

00:39:11.405 --> 00:39:12.905 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is the
pattern being broken.

00:39:12.905 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's the old
self literally, biologically.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Now think about this.

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:22.330 align:middle line:84%
When you unhook one connection
from another connection,

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.910 align:middle line:84%
if every place where one neuron
connects to another neuron

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is a memory, then we could say
that the moment you reinvent

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.640 align:middle line:84%
a new self or become
somebody else,

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:37.490 align:middle line:84%
you are biologically
dismantling the old self.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.080 align:middle line:84%
You are no longer-- and
the memory of your old self

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.330 align:middle line:90%
will be like another lifetime.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, where
does that memory go now?

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's recorded
in the soul as wisdom.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And a memory without
the emotional charge

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.537 align:middle line:90%
is called wisdom.

00:39:50.537 --> 00:39:51.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's the name of the game.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a great
answer, by the way.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a great answer.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So when we go after new
techniques, new ways of doing

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.230 align:middle line:84%
things, new patterns
of thinking,

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.410 align:middle line:84%
they literally can
adhere, if you do them

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and experience them in
the body at the same time,

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.820 align:middle line:90%
not just learn about them.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
people go to seminars

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and they see and they experience
the motivation of the room

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and they see the
motivational speaker

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:22.514 align:middle line:84%
and then they walk out the room,
and they don't apply one thing.

00:40:22.514 --> 00:40:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, two
things about that.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.150 align:middle line:84%
The latest research, the
Nobel Prize Laureate Kandel,

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.410 align:middle line:84%
when he did his
research on learning,

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.362 align:middle line:84%
he found out that when
you learn information,

00:40:32.362 --> 00:40:34.070 align:middle line:84%
you make those
connections in your brain,

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:35.760 align:middle line:90%
up to 2,600 connections.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't revisit it,
they literally over hours,

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:40.710 align:middle line:90%
they begin to break apart.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So you have to repeat it enough
times, because repetition

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.100 align:middle line:90%
is what seals those circuits.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Because as you fire a thought,
as you fire a thought,

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.100 align:middle line:84%
as you fire a thought over
time, as you keep doing it,

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.920 align:middle line:84%
these nerve cells begin to
release this Miracle-Gro,

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.490 align:middle line:84%
this glue, this
fertilizer, that causes

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.140 align:middle line:84%
them to begin to stick
and flourish together

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and make additional connections.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So it takes repetition and
then you have to embody it,

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.950 align:middle line:84%
which means you've got to
get your body involved.

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Because knowledge
without experience is

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:14.890 align:middle line:90%
called philosophy.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And experience without
knowledge is called ignorance.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have to actually
do something with it

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
so that we can begin to teach
our body what our mind has

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:90%
intellectually understood.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
the experience we

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.050 align:middle line:84%
begin to create
long term memories.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Now it's no longer
separate from us.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's get into real
practical application of this.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And as a neuroscientist,
it's amazing

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:38.460 align:middle line:84%
how you explain to
this about the brain

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.860 align:middle line:84%
chemistry and the
patterns and so forth.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Take someone who has
had sexual abuse.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And to recreate the
experience, actually

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.840 align:middle line:84%
to create a new experience of
a positive sexual experience,

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:59.180 align:middle line:84%
can you ever permanently get
rid of the negative pattern

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.440 align:middle line:84%
of such a strong
pattern as sexual abuse

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.245 align:middle line:84%
to create a whole new pattern
of sex as a positive experience?

00:42:06.245 --> 00:42:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, we need
about two bottles of wine

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and two hours for
that conversation.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:90%
But let's just say this.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.750 align:middle line:90%
There are some variables.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Number one variable is when
the sexual abuse happened.

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The younger the
child, the more it's

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.690 align:middle line:84%
imprinted subconsciously
because of brain wave patterns

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:21.230 align:middle line:90%
in children.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It also
depends on the amount

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:90%
of times, how long it lasted.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's several
variables that are involved.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.540 align:middle line:90%
But I will tell you this.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the new emerging
psychology, energy psychology,

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and EMDR and EFT and a lot
of the BodyTalk and PSYCH-K

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and network chiropractic, all of
that, what is that addressing?

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:46.790 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.980 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't know
is when they have a trauma

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and they think about the trauma,
they produce the same chemistry

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and the body as
if the trauma was happening.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So the body as the
unconscious mind

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:90%
begins to relive the trauma.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't know the
difference, right?

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.543 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:43:01.543 --> 00:43:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So the trauma
is not only in the brain,

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.100 align:middle line:84%
but it's implicitly
lodged in the body.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So the moment the person
gets in an experience of fear

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.480 align:middle line:84%
or gets in an experience
of rage or gets

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.340 align:middle line:84%
in any experience, the moment
they get in the experience,

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.150 align:middle line:84%
they're going to regress
back to that particular time

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.150 align:middle line:90%
emotionally.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So they'll turn into
the 14-year-old child

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.400 align:middle line:84%
again, because that's when
they stopped evolving.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So if feelings and emotions
are the end product

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.290 align:middle line:84%
of past experiences and
you haven't overcome

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.800 align:middle line:84%
an emotion in your
life, then you're

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.480 align:middle line:90%
literally living in the past.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And the moment your environment
begins to signal neurologically

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and chemically who
you are, you literally

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.445 align:middle line:90%
go back to that program again.

00:43:47.445 --> 00:43:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can you override it?

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We have to get
beyond the analytical mind,

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.460 align:middle line:84%
get beyond the conscious mind,
and enter into the subconscious

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.880 align:middle line:84%
mind where we can begin to
make measurable changes.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Because talk therapy's not going
to change it because all you're

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:03.410 align:middle line:84%
doing is reaffirming it
neurologically and emotionally

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.730 align:middle line:84%
conditioning your body
to remember who you are.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you get
to that sort of process?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
the process of change

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.060 align:middle line:84%
requires unlearning
and relearning.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
It requires breaking a
habit of your old self

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:90%
and reinventing a new self.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It requires pruning
synaptic connections

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.900 align:middle line:90%
and sprouting new connections.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It requires unmemorizing
an emotion in your body

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.585 align:middle line:84%
and then reconditioning
the body to a new mind

00:44:25.585 --> 00:44:26.680 align:middle line:90%
or to a new emotion.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It literally means moving from
your past into a new future.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the biological
model of change

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:84%
says that it's not enough
to just think positively.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to get down
to those emotions.

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Now people would
say, well, you don't

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.822 align:middle line:84%
want the child to
relive the abuse.

00:44:42.822 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, you're
absolutely right.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Forget about the event.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
do with the event.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the emotion.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you can begin
to work with that emotion

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and transmute that emotion
into an elevated emotion

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.920 align:middle line:84%
of forgiveness or
compassion or gratitude,

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:03.840 align:middle line:84%
the moment you begin to free
the body from that mind,

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.890 align:middle line:84%
when that begins
to happen, the body

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.500 align:middle line:84%
begins to break
free from the past.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And the side effect of that
liberation is called joy.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the body is no longer
held to the chains of the past.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And that liberation then
begins to lower the volume

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:19.880 align:middle line:90%
to the emotional charge.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
we begin to see it

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.470 align:middle line:84%
without the filter of
that emotional experience.

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you could practice
compassion by practicing joy,

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.070 align:middle line:84%
by practicing love,
you can literally--

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:90%
does the next clip show that?

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.480 align:middle line:90%
The blue one?

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Does it show how--

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
this next clip shows

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.030 align:middle line:84%
what a new experience
looks like.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.764 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So when you're in
the midst of an experience,

00:45:38.764 --> 00:45:40.430 align:middle line:84%
gangs of neurons or
jungles of neurons

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:43.330 align:middle line:84%
begin to organize
themselves to reflect

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:44.980 align:middle line:90%
the external event in your life.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And so when people are no
longer having new experiences,

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.840 align:middle line:84%
they're not doing anything new
or having new events take place

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.800 align:middle line:84%
in their life, their brains
stays actually the same.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So if a person has
difficulty in their life,

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how big
the trauma has been.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a biological
basis for change,

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.640 align:middle line:84%
both neurologically in the
brain and epigenetically

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.130 align:middle line:90%
and chemically in the body.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And all we have to do is
just find the right way

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.812 align:middle line:84%
to begin to change
those unwanted patterns

00:46:16.812 --> 00:46:18.020 align:middle line:90%
into something more positive.

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the elements,
of course, that I use

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.489 align:middle line:84%
is meditation, but there's
several ways to do it.

00:46:22.489 --> 00:46:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so we're going
to take a quick break.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.613 align:middle line:84%
When we come back we're
going to talk a little bit

00:46:26.613 --> 00:46:29.780 align:middle line:84%
about how to break
those stuck patterns

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and how to create happiness
through different ways.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.080 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lisa Garr, and I'm speaking
with neuroscientist Dr. Joe

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:41.780 align:middle line:10%
Dispenza, author of "Breaking
the Habit of Being Yourself,"

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.460 align:middle line:10%
his latest book among
many, many others.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.110 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking about
how to make new connections

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.650 align:middle line:10%
in the brain, what
it really looks

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.870 align:middle line:10%
like to make those
new connections.

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:55.300 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about notable
people, great thinkers,

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.210 align:middle line:10%
people who have made a true mark
or difference in this world.

00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.590 align:middle line:90%
What does their brain look like?

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did they think
differently than anyone else?

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.810 align:middle line:10%
>>DISPENZA: Well, if you look
at the most commonly fired, most

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.390 align:middle line:10%
neurologically wired set
of thoughts, behaviors,

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:12.010 align:middle line:10%
and emotions that people
think, that if they

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:14.480 align:middle line:10%
keep acting the same way,
thinking the same way,

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.900 align:middle line:10%
living the same way, being the
same way, feeling the same way,

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.270 align:middle line:10%
we said that by the time
they're 35 years old,

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.850 align:middle line:10%
they become a very
established identity

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:26.180 align:middle line:10%
that's a set of
memorized behaviors,

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.880 align:middle line:10%
emotional reactions that
run like automatic programs.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.170 align:middle line:84%
We could say from a
viewpoint of a brain scan,

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:84%
their brain is firing in the
same signature every day.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:84%
We call that signature
a personality.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Now what makes great
thinkers so unique,

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it was Madame
Curie or Joan of Arc

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.600 align:middle line:84%
or Queen Elizabeth I or Mahatma
Gandhi, or Einstein or Tesla--

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They all
had tragic pasts.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: They all
had moments where

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.204 align:middle line:84%
they had to overcome
themselves, right?

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.460 align:middle line:90%
And leave their past behind.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But what they did was
they learned knowledge.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And as they began to
learn information,

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:84%
they begin to contemplate
possibilities.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.900 align:middle line:84%
They began to ask what I
call frontal lobe questions.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Open ended questions.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Questions like, what
would it be like?

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.600 align:middle line:90%
How would it be?

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Speculative questions.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to ask
these speculation questions,

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:21.060 align:middle line:84%
these open ended
questions, the moment

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.020 align:middle line:84%
we begin to do that, we
begin to make the brain

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:27.500 align:middle line:84%
work in new patterns and
sequences and combinations.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is what neuroplasticity
is, that kind of ability

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.710 align:middle line:90%
to think outside the box.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.180 align:middle line:90%
There's no box in your brain.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But that signature that's
a hardwired pattern

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:84%
called an identity
really becomes

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.920 align:middle line:84%
for most people a belief or
a way of looking at life.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So when we can mix it up
and become so neuralplastic

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and think in new
and unusual ways

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and dare to be original and
step outside of convention,

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.970 align:middle line:84%
step outside of the
common beliefs at the time

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and be bold enough to think
in new and unusual ways,

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and then when you have that
moment of illumination,

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.790 align:middle line:84%
because you create
a new level of mind

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and your brain creates a
hologram or an image of what

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that is, the next step is to
trust that image and say, OK.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Now let's make it dimensional.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's bring it to life.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're inventing
an electric car

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.890 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're
creating relativity

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.260 align:middle line:84%
or you're creating
an x-ray, you have

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.090 align:middle line:84%
to do something
with that vision.

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it means
then that potential

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.140 align:middle line:84%
already exists in
the quantum field.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to do now
is once we have that mind,

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.156 align:middle line:84%
we have to begin to then
assemble it into reality.

00:49:34.156 --> 00:49:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is the plane
of demonstration.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.072 align:middle line:90%
So we have to bring it to life.

00:49:37.072 --> 00:49:39.155 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's a way
of bringing this to life.

00:49:39.155 --> 00:49:40.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a clip
that actually shows

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:43.032 align:middle line:90%
what neuroplasticity looks like.

00:49:43.032 --> 00:49:43.740 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.573 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:49:44.573 --> 00:49:46.724 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:46.724 --> 00:49:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So let's
just say, you know,

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:49.860 align:middle line:90%
your brain has all this noise.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:53.160 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking about what
you have to do after dinner.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.210 align:middle line:90%
You have emails to check.

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.700 align:middle line:84%
You have kids to
pick up at ballet.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.560 align:middle line:90%
You have deadlines at work.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But you know, you begin
to sit down for a moment

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and you begin to contemplate.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.672 align:middle line:84%
Now contemplation is really
the assembling process

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:09.380 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:10.990 align:middle line:90%
So you say, what is compassion?

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.500 align:middle line:84%
You have a frontal
lobe question.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.710 align:middle line:84%
You say, oh, I read
the book on compassion.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Or I had that experience
with my aunt Mary,

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:19.045 align:middle line:90%
or I learned about compassion.

00:50:19.045 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:90%
And, oh yeah.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I saw the DVD.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.370 align:middle line:90%
And, oh yeah.

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I had that experience
of compassion.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And, oh boy, do I have a lot
of compassion for myself.

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Your frontal lobe turns on
all these different networks

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and seamlessly
combines them together

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.650 align:middle line:90%
to create a new level of mind.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you have
a new level of mind,

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:40.010 align:middle line:84%
you have a hologram or
an image in your brain

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.760 align:middle line:84%
that represents
what compassion is.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the more you learn, if
you wanted to really know

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.690 align:middle line:84%
about compassion, the
more you learned about it,

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:49.510 align:middle line:84%
or if you wanted to
learn about success

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.910 align:middle line:84%
or if you wanted to learn
about being a great parent,

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:55.640 align:middle line:84%
the more you learn from
someone else's experiences

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and you assemble that
information neurologically

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.870 align:middle line:84%
in your brain,
the more you could

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:middle line:90%
build a more enriched model.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And then if you could
remind yourself every day,

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:08.980 align:middle line:84%
which means reproduce
the same level of mind,

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.370 align:middle line:84%
you would begin to install
the hardware in your brain

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:16.390 align:middle line:84%
to look like the experience
has already happened.

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So all of those
books that we read

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and seminars and
transformational movies

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.880 align:middle line:84%
that we see and all
of that does actually

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:26.416 align:middle line:84%
create-- those were electrical
impulses in the brain firing

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.040 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes the
connections happen, right?

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.878 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Right, but you
have to ask the questions.

00:51:30.878 --> 00:51:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So you see a book on
transcending culture,

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.870 align:middle line:84%
transcending
beliefs at the time,

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and it motivates you
for a few moments,

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:41.250 align:middle line:84%
but then you shrink back
into your resting state

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:42.200 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Then I always say, that's
just good dinner conversation.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Nothing really happened.

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you could
become inspired and you

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.860 align:middle line:84%
create a new level of
mind and you say, listen,

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.980 align:middle line:84%
if this person led
a nation and changed

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.300 align:middle line:84%
the beliefs of this
culture, then certainly

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.830 align:middle line:84%
I can change the
beliefs in my workplace.

00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Certainly I can change the
beliefs in my community.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be an
individual and I'm

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:03.740 align:middle line:90%
going to be uncompromising.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to step outside of the
conventional familiar beliefs.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
lead by example.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Now when you get to that
point where you come out

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:14.810 align:middle line:84%
of your resting state, you can't
return back to the old self.

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
create a new state of being,

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:21.530 align:middle line:84%
then it would be a good
idea to remind yourself

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.870 align:middle line:84%
who you no longer want
to be, how you no longer

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.540 align:middle line:84%
want to think, how you no longer
want to act and feel, and then

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.089 align:middle line:84%
remind yourself who you
do want to be, how you do

00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:30.880 align:middle line:84%
want to think, and how
you do want to feel.

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I had this exchange
with a taxi driver, actually.

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And we got into this
conversation about health.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying it's
extremely difficult for him

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:39.810 align:middle line:90%
to lose weight.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And he is facing a
surgery and needs

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.310 align:middle line:84%
to lose weight
before the surgery.

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very extreme
situation for him.

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said he just can't
stand the way that he looks.

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
talking about things

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that he could do
to change, he kept

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.680 align:middle line:84%
going back to that I can't
stand the way I look pattern.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like a tape
that was running in his mind.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So what you're talking
about, in order

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.940 align:middle line:84%
to create even a new image
of what he could look

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.180 align:middle line:84%
like if he lost
the weight, maybe

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.040 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't even have
to have the surgery.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But he was not going to
go there in his mind.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Listen, that
taxicab driver more than likely

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.175 align:middle line:84%
had enough
experiences of failure

00:53:20.175 --> 00:53:22.710 align:middle line:90%
that he memorized unworthiness.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:25.827 align:middle line:84%
And so he can't think
greater than how he feels.

00:53:25.827 --> 00:53:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you help
someone out of that?

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So
now the person has

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to really come out of
their resting state.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But if the person became
aware that unworthiness

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:39.490 align:middle line:84%
was driving their thoughts
and driving their behaviors,

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and that they began to
become conscious of the fact

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.560 align:middle line:84%
that they were
unconsciously unworthy

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's the reason why
they are the way they are,

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
you say to them, look.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's make this within the
realm of your acceptance.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.427 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that for the
next week that you're

00:53:54.427 --> 00:53:56.260 align:middle line:84%
going to have a protein
shake in the morning

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.464 align:middle line:90%
and do nothing else.

00:53:57.464 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Just have a protein
shake in the morning

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:84%
instead of whatever
you do in the mornings.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.333 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that sets
up the awareness.

00:54:02.333 --> 00:54:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: And he wins.

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:04.459 align:middle line:90%
He wins the first week.

00:54:04.459 --> 00:54:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
week you say, OK,

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.140 align:middle line:84%
now that you've actually
done that, then only

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.920 align:middle line:90%
salads for lunch.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Now do that, and
I want you to win.

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So now he has two
weeks of winning.

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Then the third
week you say, look.

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Instead of riding
the bus to work,

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:22.840 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
walk a mile to work.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And now he wins at that.

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So now he's developing
a lifestyle change.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.430 align:middle line:90%
He's thinking differently.

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:30.430 align:middle line:90%
He's acting differently.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:31.870 align:middle line:90%
He's doing things differently.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:33.310 align:middle line:90%
He's feeling differently.

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And over time, as long and
you set up those experiences

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:40.480 align:middle line:84%
within the realm of
what he can accomplish,

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.080 align:middle line:84%
then he's beginning to create
emotions where he's starting

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.880 align:middle line:84%
to feel like he is worth
it, that he can do it,

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.500 align:middle line:90%
that it is possible.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But when he looks
at the big picture

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:53.090 align:middle line:84%
of 75 pounds he has to
lose, he shrinks back

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:55.090 align:middle line:84%
into that feeling
of unworthiness

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:58.750 align:middle line:84%
because he's viewing
his future emotionally

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.210 align:middle line:90%
through the lens of the past.

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:04.030 align:middle line:84%
If emotions are the record
of a past experience,

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:06.650 align:middle line:84%
you can't go to a
new future holding

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:07.920 align:middle line:90%
onto the emotions of the past.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Its impossible.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to lay
down that emotion.

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:14.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to unmemorize it and
begin to become somebody else.

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
would encourage him

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:19.290 align:middle line:84%
to act as if, to do
things that are actually

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:20.870 align:middle line:90%
in the environment.

00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Walking, starting with
the protein shake.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, the person
who went through the abuse.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:30.490 align:middle line:84%
To set up situations
of worthiness,

00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:33.210 align:middle line:84%
just to set those environments
up for themselves.

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:36.020 align:middle line:84%
What would that look
like in the brain?

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, remember,
experience enriches the brain.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So your brain is a
record of the past.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.496 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is
organized to reflect

00:55:47.496 --> 00:55:48.870 align:middle line:84%
everything you
know in your life.

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:51.346 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is a record
of the environment.

00:55:51.346 --> 00:55:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then yours
must be really full.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:53.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Really big brain, you must have.

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So if
you think about this,

00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:02.190 align:middle line:84%
your brain is a record of your
past up until this moment.

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:03.850 align:middle line:84%
The people you know,
the people you've

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.891 align:middle line:84%
known, the places you've
lived, the things you've

00:56:05.891 --> 00:56:07.200 align:middle line:90%
done at different times.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is really a record
of your past environment.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you're trying to
create a new future,

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.940 align:middle line:84%
then you'd better neurologically
install the circuitry ahead.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So you take the person
and you say, OK, look.

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I know that you failed
enough times at this.

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's
like to be this way.

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
take us 15 weeks.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to make
slow, steady progress.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
learn about this.

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.022 align:middle line:84%
This is what this is
going to do for you.

00:56:38.022 --> 00:56:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And then when he
gets his behaviors

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.240 align:middle line:84%
to match his intentions,
not only is he

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.120 align:middle line:84%
installing the circuits because
he's learning new things,

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.660 align:middle line:84%
but now when he
has the experience,

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.200 align:middle line:84%
the experience is
causing more neurons

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.410 align:middle line:84%
to enrich the circuits
that he learned.

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Then he's beginning to feel
a little bit like, hey, I

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:90%
can do this.

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:55.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's not only the brain.

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.889 align:middle line:84%
You cultivate a new
mind by learning first,

00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and then you experience
and it enriches it.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But then you begin to
feel like it's possible.

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.760 align:middle line:90%
So it goes something like this.

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:10.460 align:middle line:84%
You learn something new, then
you begin to make new choices.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.880 align:middle line:84%
New choices lead
to new behaviors.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.080 align:middle line:84%
New behaviors lead
to new experiences.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And new experiences
lead to new emotions.

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then that fires the
chemicals back to the brain.

00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:04.560 align:middle line:90%
We're immersed in it.

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:05.726 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:58:05.726 --> 00:58:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So the human potential field,
I mean, the human energy field

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that surrounds the
earth that's between you

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and I right now, it's between
the people watching right now.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.600 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected through
those billions of firings.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.040 align:middle line:90%
That's how that happens?

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, our brain is
a superconductor of this field.

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Our brain is a superconductor
of consciousness, right?

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Our nervous system is what hooks
us up to this infinite field.

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at an
atom, if you take an atom,

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and you look at it
very closely, an atom

00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:43.670 align:middle line:84%
is 99.99-- thirteen
nine's after that point.

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:46.270 align:middle line:90%
99.999% nothing.

00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:47.630 align:middle line:90%
It's empty space.

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:48.810 align:middle line:90%
It's frequency.

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:49.710 align:middle line:90%
It's information.

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:50.850 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing materially.

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:55.490 align:middle line:90%
It's 0.000001% particle matter.

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So everything is more
nothing than something.

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about everything
made up of atoms and particles,

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:06.050 align:middle line:84%
then there's an invisible field
that's holding all of this

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:06.800 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:07.990 align:middle line:90%
That's potentials.

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Now when you and I are living
by the hormones of stress,

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:14.690 align:middle line:84%
when you and I are living by the
fight or flight nervous system,

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:17.840 align:middle line:84%
when we're living by those
very limited emotions, anger

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and fear and sadness
and suffering and guilt,

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.270 align:middle line:84%
the brain naturally does
something very unique.

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:27.420 align:middle line:84%
When we live by those emotions,
we function as materialists.

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We feel separate
from possibility.

00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're in
that heightened state,

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.950 align:middle line:84%
our senses are telling
us the way reality is.

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So we become focused on
three things: the body,

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:40.400 align:middle line:90%
the environment, and time.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.980 align:middle line:90%
That's how we live our life.

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So we begin to obsess
about our bodies,

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.640 align:middle line:90%
our hairstyles, our clothes.

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.010 align:middle line:90%
We obsess about things.

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Our cars or whatever.

00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:49.770 align:middle line:90%
We obsess about time.

00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:52.420 align:middle line:84%
We become enslaved
to this dimension.

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Now what we're really
saying is, when we function

00:59:55.120 --> 01:00:01.090 align:middle line:84%
as materialists, we keep all of
our attention on that 0.000001%

01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:02.270 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to omit the
99.99% of possibility that's

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.136 align:middle line:90%
waiting for us to experience.

01:00:10.136 --> 01:00:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fascinating.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So you're really talking
quantum physics here.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're affected
by our environment.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.040 align:middle line:84%
The movie again that you're
in, the Austin Vickers movie,

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.420 align:middle line:84%
"People v. The State of
Illusion," has a lot of that.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.742 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole clip that has
to do with that, that sets up

01:00:26.742 --> 01:00:29.104 align:middle line:84%
that entire concept
of how we are indeed

01:00:29.104 --> 01:00:30.270 align:middle line:90%
affected by our environment.

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:31.814 align:middle line:90%
And let's take a look at that.

01:00:31.814 --> 01:00:32.590 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.720 align:middle line:10%
>>To change, then, is to think
greater than the environment,

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.840 align:middle line:10%
to think greater than
the circumstances,

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.370 align:middle line:10%
and act greater than the
conditions in our life.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.350 align:middle line:10%
And every great person in
history understood this.

01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:46.650 align:middle line:10%
They knew that they had
to believe in a future

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.440 align:middle line:10%
that they couldn't see or
experience with their senses

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.810 align:middle line:10%
yet, but they've thought
about enough times

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:56.280 align:middle line:10%
and embraced emotionally enough
times that they were ahead

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.540 align:middle line:10%
of their time, that they had
put the hardware in place

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.260 align:middle line:10%
by thinking in new ways.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.430 align:middle line:10%
And they began to
emotionally embrace the event

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.750 align:middle line:10%
before it happened,
even though there

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.640 align:middle line:10%
was no sensory data coming
from their environment yet.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.260 align:middle line:10%
We could say, then,
that they were actually

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:14.634 align:middle line:10%
changed neurologically
and physiologically ahead

01:01:14.634 --> 01:01:17.820 align:middle line:10%
of the event, and they
couldn't live any other way.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.760 align:middle line:10%
They were already
believing in that outcome

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.770 align:middle line:10%
without any physical
evidence yet.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:24.470 align:middle line:10%
>>We are more powerful
than we imagine.

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:27.030 align:middle line:10%
Within us lies the
key to shifting

the way life has always
responded and is responding

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.680 align:middle line:10%
to us.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.700 align:middle line:10%
The only question we
must decide is, are we

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.500 align:middle line:10%
willing to look inward
instead of outward

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.870 align:middle line:10%
and feel the discomfort
and fear that

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:43.100 align:middle line:10%
comes with changing the
process of our thinking?

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.130 align:middle line:10%
Or in other words, are we
willing to step outside

01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:50.000 align:middle line:10%
of our prison walls and
say yes to the unknown,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.358 align:middle line:10%

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So how does this relate to
us on a quantum physics level

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.787 align:middle line:90%
exactly?

01:01:57.787 --> 01:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, if
your brain and body are

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
a record of the past,
then it begs the question,

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
can you believe in a future
that you can't see or experience

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.090 align:middle line:84%
with your senses yet,
but you've thought

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
about enough times in your mind
that your brain is literally

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:18.544 align:middle line:84%
changed to look like that future
event has already happened?

01:02:18.544 --> 01:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's
what visualization is.

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:21.959 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You can
call it visualization,

01:02:21.959 --> 01:02:24.247 align:middle line:84%
mental rehearsal, vision
board, whatever it is.

01:02:24.247 --> 01:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All of that.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But it's not
enough to just think about it

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:28.650 align:middle line:90%
neurologically.

01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:30.915 align:middle line:84%
Although the brain
will look like,

01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:33.216 align:middle line:84%
from a neuroscience
standpoint, the brain

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:35.090 align:middle line:84%
will look like it already
had the experience.

01:02:35.090 --> 01:02:36.327 align:middle line:90%
We know that as a fact.

01:02:36.327 --> 01:02:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:38.451 align:middle line:84%
Well, from what
we've learned so far.

01:02:38.451 --> 01:02:40.194 align:middle line:84%
We do you have to
visually see it?

01:02:40.194 --> 01:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, it
doesn't have to be.

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to use
the word visualize

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:45.990 align:middle line:90%
because it omits certain people.

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I like to use the word
mentally rehearse.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So if I say to a guy sometimes,
can you visualize this?

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Most men will say, I
can't visualize that.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.946 align:middle line:84%
But if I say, if you
can rehearse mentally,

01:02:56.946 --> 01:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
can you concept yourself
hitting a golf ball?

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.590 align:middle line:90%
They'll go, oh, absolutely.

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So I like to use
mentally rehearse

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:06.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of a simpler
way for people to get into it.

01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's not enough to
just do that though.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:14.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to begin to emotionally
embrace that future event

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
before it's actually
made manifest.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So much so that you begin to
convince your body emotionally

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that that future event
has already happened now,

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
so much so that you begin to
signal new genes and new ways

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to change your body to look
like the event has happened.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you
want a new body,

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
a different look, you need to
see it, hear it, feel it, taste

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.920 align:middle line:90%
it, smell it.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.180 align:middle line:90%
You need to integrate it in.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But we don't have
to just say, like, a new body.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.510 align:middle line:90%
We could say, like--

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Health.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%

01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:47.744 align:middle line:84%
You could say a
new relationship.

01:03:47.744 --> 01:03:48.840 align:middle line:90%
You could say joy.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.760 align:middle line:90%
Here, listen.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
When your brain and body
are physically changed

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
to look like the
event has happened,

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.219 align:middle line:84%
then in the quantum
field, the event

01:03:56.219 --> 01:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
has already happened because
there's physical evidence.

01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Now when you get
to this point where

01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
you're in the state where
you've experienced it

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:07.190 align:middle line:84%
enough times that you know
that you know, get ready.

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:09.615 align:middle line:84%
Because the event is
going to find you.

01:04:09.615 --> 01:04:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It'll happen?

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.084 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's going to come
in a way that you least expect.

01:04:13.084 --> 01:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
mental gymnastics.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.497 align:middle line:90%
This is exciting to me.

01:04:15.497 --> 01:04:16.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's so fun.

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's
going to surprise you.

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come in a way
that you would never predict.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.110 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can predict
it, it's nothing new.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.300 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be new and unusual.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And now you have a
two-way relationship

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.710 align:middle line:90%
with this quantum field.

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not living
in the hormones of survival

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:37.850 align:middle line:84%
where you're trying to
predict the next moment

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.460 align:middle line:90%
based on the past moment.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You are trusting in an
outcome beyond your senses.

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And because you're
trusting in the outcome,

01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:47.651 align:middle line:84%
you're in an elevated state and
you feel connected to something

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:48.150 align:middle line:90%
greater.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And you would never
try to figure out

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
how it's going to happen or
when it's going to happen.

01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:53.680 align:middle line:90%
You're too busy being it.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.170 align:middle line:84%
The moment you try to figure
out when it's going to happen,

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
you've just returned
back to the old self.

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty here is that when
you change your brain and body

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
to look like the event
has already happened,

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:06.800 align:middle line:84%
they're no longer a
record of the past now.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Now they're a map to the future.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And to live by this law is to
live by the quantum law which

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
says, environment is an
extension of your mind.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
If you truly change
your mind, there

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.380 align:middle line:90%
should be evidence in your life.

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this how
you healed yourself?

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:25.102 align:middle line:84%
You had a pretty severe
back injury, didn't you?

01:05:25.102 --> 01:05:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
It kind of started me
on this whole journey.

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:31.310 align:middle line:90%


01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I think all
of us as human beings usually

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
wait for crisis or trauma or
disease or diagnoses or loss.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm sure you could
explain that neurologically.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:45.000 align:middle line:84%
We wait for when the ego
is knocked to its lowest

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
denominator before we
get about changing.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:50.276 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're
in crisis, we begin

01:05:50.276 --> 01:05:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to examine who we're being.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We begin to look to see if
these thoughts are loving to us

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
or if these behaviors
really support us

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
or if these emotions
are really helping

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.800 align:middle line:90%
us to go to a new future.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So in my situation, I got run
over by a truck in a triathlon

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
when I was in my
20s in Palm Springs.

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And I wound up breaking
six bones in my back

01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and I had bone fragments
on my spinal cord,

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and was in pretty rough shape.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And so to make
the story short, I

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
had four opinions from
four of the leading

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
surgeons in Southern California.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were all recommending
that I had Harrington rod

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.725 align:middle line:84%
surgery, which means
take the back parts off

01:06:31.725 --> 01:06:35.900 align:middle line:84%
of your vertebrae and put in
long, stainless steel rods

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully that'll get you
back on your feet someday.

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
So I decided
against the surgery.

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was simple enough
and young enough at the time

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
to believe that there is some
power that's giving us life.

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:51.761 align:middle line:90%
Now I wasn't going anywhere now.

01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:52.760 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't doing anything.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I was lying face down
and I could hardly move.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.255 align:middle line:90%
And I said, look.

01:06:57.255 --> 01:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
If I could make contact
with this intelligence

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and begin to give it a
template, a design, something

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted, and then
surrender it to this mind

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and ask it to resolve it
in a way that was right

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
for me, maybe,
just maybe it would

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.070 align:middle line:90%
begin to do the healing for me.

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So I understood
that the power that

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.190 align:middle line:84%
made the body healed
the body, but I think it

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
only healed within its
rudimentary, basic way.

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking it to
go to the next level.

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where did you
get that thought at 20?

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I was
24 at the time.

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, you know,
I was a chiropractor.

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the principles
of chiropractic

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.240 align:middle line:84%
is the power that made
the body heals the body.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I made
myself two promises.

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
One was that if this
intelligence existed

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and if it was both
personal and universal,

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:53.280 align:middle line:84%
it was a consciousness, and
consciousness is awareness,

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and awareness is
paying attention.

01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So it must be paying
attention to me.

01:07:56.910 --> 01:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So I might as well
get really focused

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and get really clear
on what I wanted.

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to design what
I wanted my spine to look like.

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And if I found my mind
wandering to something else,

01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:12.626 align:middle line:84%
I would stop and
start all over again.

01:08:12.626 --> 01:08:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
trained your mind.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.416 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I didn't know that
I was doing it at the time,

01:08:16.416 --> 01:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
but I began to really
get very focused.

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I said that I
won't let any thought go by

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.875 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't want
to experience.

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:24.721 align:middle line:84%
I just would not
let that happen.

01:08:24.721 --> 01:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Like, any thought.

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:25.979 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you mean?

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:27.978 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I'm
never going to walk again,

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:30.779 align:middle line:90%
I'd be paralyzed.

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
My friends and family were
telling me to sell my practice.

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.771 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I can't do that.

01:08:35.771 --> 01:08:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, it
would be better sell it.

01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:39.228 align:middle line:84%
I said, if I sell
it, then it means

01:08:39.228 --> 01:08:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that I won't be able to
walk, and I can't do that.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.437 align:middle line:84%
So I just made the
deal with myself

01:08:44.437 --> 01:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't going
to let any thought

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.479 align:middle line:84%
slip by that I didn't
want to experience.

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So first four weeks
was really torturous,

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.109 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know
how unfocused I was.

01:08:55.109 --> 01:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But after a period
of time I started

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
noticing that what I
was doing inside of me

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
started to produce some
results outside of me.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.439 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I noticed
what I did inside

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
of me to produce that result
outside of me, I did it again.

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.386 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
heal very quickly.

01:09:11.386 --> 01:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This was through
the mental rehearsal

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
that you were doing,
as you call it.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.668 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

01:09:15.668 --> 01:09:19.359 align:middle line:84%
And so I got back on my feet
in about 10 and a half weeks,

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:22.779 align:middle line:84%
and was back to my normal
life around 11 weeks.

01:09:22.779 --> 01:09:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can imagine you became
very impassioned about what

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.405 align:middle line:90%
it means to mentally rehearse.

01:09:28.405 --> 01:09:30.029 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I
just got very clear

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
that mind and body
are very correlated.

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just made a
deal with myself

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.819 align:middle line:84%
that I would spend the
rest of my life studying it

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
if I was ever able
to walk again.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:38.899 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:39.770 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I hear that from
people in your position

01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that have had
incredible careers,

01:09:45.490 --> 01:09:47.423 align:middle line:84%
but it's not even from
your drive or desire

01:09:47.423 --> 01:09:48.214 align:middle line:90%
to have the career.

01:09:48.214 --> 01:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
It's from that
mission and passion

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that comes from your
experience of healing yourself.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen or attracted into
your life-- back to the quantum

01:09:57.590 --> 01:10:01.370 align:middle line:84%
physics model-- those
people who have experienced

01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:02.787 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous
remissions since then?

01:10:02.787 --> 01:10:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You know, that's
been my passion pretty much

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.150 align:middle line:90%
for the last 12 years.

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled to many different
countries around the world.

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And I studied people
that were diagnosed

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
with health conditions,
chronic and acute, whether it

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
was cancer, MS, or rheumatoid
arthritis or thyroid

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:23.030 align:middle line:84%
conditions, our lupus or
chronic pain or depression.

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:26.437 align:middle line:84%
And they were treating,
you know, conventionally

01:10:26.437 --> 01:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
or unconventionally,
either getting the same

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:29.230 align:middle line:90%
or getting worse.

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden,
they got better.

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I interviewed
many, many people

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to find out
what the common things were

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.800 align:middle line:90%
that allowed them to get better.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think
by taking a medication

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:47.904 align:middle line:84%
for a specific disease or
treating that specific disease

01:10:47.904 --> 01:10:50.195 align:middle line:84%
that that's reaffirming that
that disease still exists?

01:10:50.195 --> 01:10:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: No.

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely don't think that.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that you have
three types of stresses:

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
physical, chemical,
and emotional.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Which means you have three types
of ways to create balance back

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.610 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

01:11:00.610 --> 01:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Physically, chemically,
and emotionally.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Now most people will
take the chemical route

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.219 align:middle line:84%
and they'll use
medications, but they're not

01:11:09.219 --> 01:11:10.260 align:middle line:90%
changing their lifestyle.

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not doing anything
different physically.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting over
their emotional states.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you just can't rely
on just one element of those.

01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
We have to work on
all three of those.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.294 align:middle line:84%
So when I study
spontaneous remissions,

01:11:22.294 --> 01:11:24.710 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that I noticed
that people had in common

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
is when they were healed,
they knew they were better.

01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:29.390 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
to take the test.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:31.000 align:middle line:90%
They said, I know I'm better.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor would
say, how would you know?

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And they say, because I know.

01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they went back
for their tests, their blood

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.660 align:middle line:84%
values, their scans or whatever,
and of course they were better.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So when you know that you know,
I call that enlightenment.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment is when
you know that you know.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was interesting, because
they had some common things.

01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And then my interest
was once I was

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:58.140 align:middle line:84%
able to demystify that
miraculous healing

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and figure out the
commonalities, the next most

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:03.580 align:middle line:84%
important thing was,
can I reproduce it?

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So then once I
knew those things,

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:08.044 align:middle line:84%
then let's see if we can take
people that have conditions

01:12:08.044 --> 01:12:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and let's see if
we can change it.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.537 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy to say in the
last two years-- you know,

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I wrote
"Breaking the Habit."

01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we've seen
people heal themselves

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:18.476 align:middle line:90%
of cancer intentionally.

01:12:18.476 --> 01:12:21.740 align:middle line:90%


01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Many people from MS, from
lupus, from Hashimoto syndrome,

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:30.360 align:middle line:84%
from all kinds of
crazy-- diabetes.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And once again,
that's by "Breaking

01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:37.400 align:middle line:84%
the Habit of Being Yourself"
is once again reestablishing

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.909 align:middle line:84%
that connection with
the mind and the body,

01:12:39.909 --> 01:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and reaffirming and
rehearsing the healing.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:42.930 align:middle line:90%
And listen.

01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we can make
thought more real

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.490 align:middle line:84%
than anything else-- that's
the privilege, right?

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin
to, as an example,

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:53.600 align:middle line:84%
if you begin to think about
telling your co-worker off

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.845 align:middle line:84%
and you're driving to work
and you're thinking about,

01:12:55.845 --> 01:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to say this
and I'm going to do this.

01:12:57.970 --> 01:12:59.625 align:middle line:84%
No, no, better yet
I'll write an email.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.622 align:middle line:84%
And you run through the
scenario in your head.

01:13:01.622 --> 01:13:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And then you say, no, no, no.

01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to
the boss and then

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.488 align:middle line:90%
we're going to talk about it.

01:13:05.488 --> 01:13:08.262 align:middle line:84%
And you're rehearsing
mentally a new way of being.

01:13:08.262 --> 01:13:10.470 align:middle line:84%
There will come a moment
that the thought that you're

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:13.800 align:middle line:84%
thinking will literally become
the experience in your brain.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
The moment that
happens, you begin

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to produce the chemistry
as if that future event

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:20.990 align:middle line:90%
is happening to you now.

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And your body as the unconscious
mind is living in that future

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
now, which means your body
literally is physiologically

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:28.260 align:middle line:90%
changing.

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you
get to work, you're

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:33.284 align:middle line:90%
a walking, talking crazy person.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And all you did
was drive to work.

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
We could say that you moved into
a new state of being, right?

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So you and I have been
hypnotized and conditioned

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
into believing that we
need a reason for joy,

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.230 align:middle line:84%
that we need a
reason for gratitude.

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:48.810 align:middle line:90%
That's cause and effect.

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Wait for the experience to
do something before you feel.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.280 align:middle line:90%
That's very Newtonian physics.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Very cause and effect.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying to give thanks
ahead of the experience.

01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So much so that you convince
your body emotionally

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.190 align:middle line:90%
that it's already done.

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Because gratitude means
it's already done.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.340 align:middle line:84%
You give thanks
when it happened.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So if your body is
the unconscious mind

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and you can bring up
gratitude ahead of the event,

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.840 align:middle line:84%
then your body begins to believe
that that future event has

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.220 align:middle line:90%
already occurred.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So thank you for the
healing that has already begun.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.279 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the
money that is in--

01:14:21.279 --> 01:14:23.815 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But not only
an intellectual process.

01:14:23.815 --> 01:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are the
language of the brain,

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.190 align:middle line:84%
but feelings are the
language of the body.

01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:29.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to move into
a state of being.

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when you can give
thanks and convince your body

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that it's already done, the
environment is no longer

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:36.030 align:middle line:84%
signaling the gene,
you're signaling

01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:37.446 align:middle line:84%
the gene ahead of
the environment.

01:14:37.446 --> 01:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Now it's no longer
cause and effect.

01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Now you're causing an effect.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So when we begin to do that
properly, the beauty behind it

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is then we become
quantum creators.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So people would say,
oh, that's nonsense.

01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:52.129 align:middle line:84%
And you would say, you're
absolutely correct.

01:14:52.129 --> 01:14:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics is
beyond the senses.

01:14:53.670 --> 01:14:55.628 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am so glad that
you said it that way.

01:14:55.628 --> 01:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to get very
heady here and speak only

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.260 align:middle line:84%
about the mind and be very
scientific about all of this.

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But your main message is
the connection with the body

01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and really, the body's
connection back to the mind,

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and how the body experiences
and expresses what

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.040 align:middle line:90%
it is creating or desiring.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Now when the chemical reactions
happen through the body,

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:23.820 align:middle line:84%
does that go beyond the body
also in a vibratory manner?

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So we know
from some experiments that

01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
have been done that if
you take a group of people

01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and you set three vials
of DNA in front of them,

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and you say to them, these
are expert players, people

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:43.200 align:middle line:90%
who really can affect something.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.540 align:middle line:84%
You say to them, now, with
all of your intention,

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
we want you to see this
DNA wind or unwind.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have these people
practice the experiment.

01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And you check that DNA at
the end the experiment.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
The power of intention does
absolutely nothing to the DNA.

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Thought does nothing
to change the DNA.

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You say to those
people now, we want

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.750 align:middle line:84%
you to move into
an elevated mood.

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:07.910 align:middle line:84%
We want you to feel
gratitude or joy or goodwill,

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and we want you to just
emanate this feeling out

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum field and
do it over and over again.

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
If you check the DNA at
the end of that experiment,

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.310 align:middle line:84%
nothing's happened
to the DNA either.

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.994 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

01:16:18.994 --> 01:16:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Elevated emotion
did absolutely nothing.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you say to
them, now we want

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:26.937 align:middle line:84%
you to see the DNA
unwind-- thought.

01:16:26.937 --> 01:16:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And we want you to move into
the elevated emotion of how

01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
you would feel if
the DNA unwinds.

01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:36.890 align:middle line:84%
25% of the DNA unwinds
at a remote location.

01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So our thoughts tend to
be electrical in nature

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and our feelings tend to
be magnetic in nature.

01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And how we think
and feel broadcasts

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic
signature that

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
influences every single
atom in your life.

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The thought sends a
signal out and the feeling

01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:54.680 align:middle line:90%
draws the event back.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Now if thinking and feeling
creates a state of being,

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.030 align:middle line:84%
the quantum field responds
to who you're being.

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Not what you think
or what you feel,

01:17:03.630 --> 01:17:05.270 align:middle line:90%
but the combination of them.

01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that begins to
broadcast the signature.

01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So what if you woke
up in the morning

01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and you said, what is the
greatest expression of myself

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:16.940 align:middle line:90%
that I could be today?

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
What is the greatest
ideal of myself?

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And let me remind myself how
I'm not going to think today.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Let me review the thoughts that
bring me back to the old self

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.425 align:middle line:84%
so they would never
slip by unnoticed.

01:17:29.425 --> 01:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why would you go
to the negative like that?

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Because
the importance is

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
is to observe them so they
never slip by unnoticed.

01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Most people-- think about it.

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Most people, they start
off with good intentions,

01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:44.850 align:middle line:84%
but they wind up on the couch
with the remote control.

01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And they just said
two hours earlier

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.606 align:middle line:90%
they were going to work out.

01:17:47.606 --> 01:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have to begin to denature
the old self neurologically.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to observe
those thoughts,

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:56.570 align:middle line:84%
observe those behaviors,
observe those emotions,

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:58.160 align:middle line:84%
so you would never
allow yourself

01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.540 align:middle line:90%
to go unconscious to them again.

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.206 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I hadn't
thought of it that way.

01:18:01.206 --> 01:18:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: The word meditation,
the actual literal translation

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.520 align:middle line:84%
of the word
meditation in Tibetan

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.700 align:middle line:90%
means, to become familiar with.

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you become familiar
with your unconscious thoughts,

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:16.200 align:middle line:84%
when you begin to
notice and become

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
familiar with your
unconscious habits,

01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to become familiar
with your unconscious emotions

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and feelings, if you're knowing
yourself, that's meditation.

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Now most people don't want to
light a match in a dark place.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.520 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather turn on the
TV or get on the computer,

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
try to make that
feeling go away.

01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
The process of
change, first you have

01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
to become familiar
with the old self

01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
so much so you're going
into the operating

01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
system of the subconscious
and bringing it

01:18:43.530 --> 01:18:46.510 align:middle line:84%
to your conscious awareness
so that you know that it would

01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:48.780 align:middle line:90%
never slip by unchecked by you.

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Then if you said, let me remind
myself on who I do want to be.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.405 align:middle line:84%
And you began to
think in new ways.

01:18:55.405 --> 01:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And you began to
plan your behaviors.

01:18:57.810 --> 01:19:00.207 align:middle line:84%
And you became so involved
in that experience

01:19:00.207 --> 01:19:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that the thought
became the experience

01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and you began to feel
like that new ideal.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Now you would get up not as
the same person who sat down.

01:19:07.930 --> 01:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if you got up as the
same person who sat down,

01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:11.820 align:middle line:90%
nothing's happened.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:14.310 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum field,
neurologically, biologically,

01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:15.770 align:middle line:84%
chemically,
genetically, you have

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:17.240 align:middle line:90%
to get up as somebody else.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.819 align:middle line:10%
And when you get up in
that new state of being--

01:19:19.819 --> 01:19:21.610 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That's when
the true change occurs.

01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You're broadcasting

signature.

01:19:24.329 --> 01:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
maintain that modified

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
state of mind and
body your entire day,

01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
get ready, because your
life is about to change.

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:33.550 align:middle line:84%
The universe is going to
organize an event in your life

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:34.960 align:middle line:90%
in a way that's right for you.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.774 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Here, here.

01:19:35.774 --> 01:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
There are so many things that
are running through my brain

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:39.625 align:middle line:90%
when I'm talking with you.

01:19:39.625 --> 01:19:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So then you
would become familiar

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.330 align:middle line:90%
with the new self.

01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to become
familiar with the new self,

01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:45.361 align:middle line:90%
you're still meditating, right?

01:19:45.361 --> 01:19:48.070 align:middle line:84%
You're saying, I'm
firing, wiring a new mind

01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm conditioning
my body emotionally.

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:52.409 align:middle line:84%
And if I practice it every
day and I remind myself,

01:19:52.409 --> 01:19:53.950 align:middle line:84%
it'll begin to become
familiar to me.

01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's how
it really happens.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So now you were
talking about before,

01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:59.610 align:middle line:84%
you can actually create long
distance healings on people,

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:01.560 align:middle line:84%
or you can actually
heal other people

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.015 align:middle line:84%
through those reactions that you
were talking about on the vials

01:20:05.015 --> 01:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
or by creating the mind
and the body in connection

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.870 align:middle line:84%
to create healing
for other people.

01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
You can also create
healing for yourself.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And then that in
turn reverberates

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
to create new changes and
new experiences for yourself.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.077 align:middle line:90%
And they attract to you, right?

01:20:20.077 --> 01:20:20.785 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

01:20:20.785 --> 01:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And the quantum model says that
consciousness is non-local.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, we feel
separate from everything,

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.890 align:middle line:84%
but on the quantum
level, energetically--

01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:31.452 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It could
happen at any time.

01:20:31.452 --> 01:20:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Healing
at a remote location,

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.850 align:middle line:84%
according to the quantum
model, is very probable.

01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:38.292 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have another clip
that I want to show you.

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It kind of encompasses
all of this.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.421 align:middle line:90%
It puts it all together for you.

01:20:41.421 --> 01:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this,
because we have

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.019 align:middle line:84%
to put it into our

of this 90 minutes,

01:22:46.713 --> 01:22:48.280 align:middle line:84%
you really are
going to understand

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.330 align:middle line:84%
what it means to create
change, and that change

01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:52.810 align:middle line:90%
is truly possible.

01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:55.211 align:middle line:84%
I noticed in that clip that
it mentioned about creation.

01:22:55.211 --> 01:22:56.960 align:middle line:84%
What does creation
look like in the brain?

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, we live
in two states of mind.

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.782 align:middle line:84%
We either live in survival
or we live in creation.

01:23:00.782 --> 01:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
When you live in
survival, it's all

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
about the body, the
environment, and time.

01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:07.055 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in that
elegant moment of creation--

01:23:07.055 --> 01:23:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and we all have had these
moments-- the first thing that

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440 align:middle line:84%
happens is you forget
about yourself.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer identifying
with your environment.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.830 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
thinking about your body,

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:18.570 align:middle line:90%
and you lose track of time.

01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
the frontal lobe

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
begins to control
the rest of the brain

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to
quiet down the rest

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of the circuits in your brain
so that nothing else is being

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.220 align:middle line:84%
processed but that
single thought.

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
you become very present.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.606 align:middle line:84%
And when you get very
present like that,

01:23:35.606 --> 01:23:37.480 align:middle line:84%
the thought that you're
thinking is literally

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.260 align:middle line:90%
captured in the brain.

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to think
in new and unusual ways.

01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And so in order for us to truly
be in a state of creation,

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.504 align:middle line:84%
we have to get beyond those
survival or addictive emotions.

01:23:48.504 --> 01:23:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The ego.

01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:50.211 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: That's right.

01:23:50.211 --> 01:23:52.150 align:middle line:90%
We have to become ego-less.

01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:54.030 align:middle line:90%
You have to become selfless.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And when the frontal lobe
is in control like that,

01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:58.500 align:middle line:84%
it's like a great
symphony leader.

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like a CEO that says,
quiet down back there.

01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I need to just pay
attention to this thought,

01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:06.935 align:middle line:84%
and I need to create
something new and unusual.

01:24:06.935 --> 01:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it's ironic
that, in order

01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:11.640 align:middle line:84%
for us to have control
over our bodies,

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:14.290 align:middle line:84%
change our bodies health-wise,
or change something

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
in our environment or our life
or change something in time,

01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
first we have to become
nobody, no thing, no time.

01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to become
pure consciousness

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to have dominion over the body,
the environment, and time.

01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:26.857 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In order
to create newly--

01:24:26.857 --> 01:24:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wonder--
have you ever looked

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.150 align:middle line:84%
at the brain of
somebody who does

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
an amazing amount of
philanthropic or compassionate

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
work or hunger projects,
or things like that?

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Are they in that state of
creation most of the time?

01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
they're certainly

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.700 align:middle line:84%
not running the same
stress hormones.

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And so their forebrain
tends to be in more control.

01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
They think clearer, they
have more clear vision.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not distracted
by their emotions.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.780 align:middle line:84%
They can get their behaviors
to match their intentions,

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.400 align:middle line:90%
and they can follow through.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to be more
forebrained focused.

01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%

The hope I am really
representing is yours.

of a better financial future

01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:38.590 align:middle line:10%
or that book you've
always wanted to write.

01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:41.170 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe it is your dream
to start your own company

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.930 align:middle line:10%
or change the world in
your own unique way.

01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:46.820 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps it is the dream of a
better future for your children

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:51.190 align:middle line:10%
or of greater physical health
or finding your soul mate.

01:25:51.190 --> 01:25:54.520 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's simply a dream
of finding lasting peace

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.450 align:middle line:10%
and happiness.

01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:59.430 align:middle line:10%
For each of us, hope
is a different dream,

01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:01.060 align:middle line:10%
a different imagination.

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.980 align:middle line:10%
But for all of us, hope
must be carefully protected

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:08.550 align:middle line:10%
and nurtured or she can be
easily abused and neglected.

01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:12.110 align:middle line:10%
And it is our fears,
our compromises,

01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:14.335 align:middle line:10%
and our state of illusion
that create her harm.

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:18.540 align:middle line:10%
And when this happens long
enough, hope is taken away.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.930 align:middle line:10%
And it is each of us that
ends up in our own prisons.

01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:23.670 align:middle line:10%
The trial of your
life doesn't have

01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:27.200 align:middle line:10%
to be a tragic love story,
a tale of endless pursuit,

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.660 align:middle line:10%
or an examination of
neglected hopes and dreams.

It can be a story of redemption,
a story of finding and learning

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:38.710 align:middle line:10%
to love yourself.

01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:42.180 align:middle line:10%
It can be an inspiring example
of protecting your hopes

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:45.610 align:middle line:10%
and dreams and pursuing them,
not because they make sense

01:26:45.610 --> 01:26:48.760 align:middle line:10%
to others or are
obviously achievable,

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.140 align:middle line:10%
but rather because
they define you.

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:52.530 align:middle line:10%
They belong to you.

01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:56.690 align:middle line:10%
And without them,
you have nothing.

01:26:56.690 --> 01:26:58.390 align:middle line:10%
The choice is yours.

possible, no matter what
economic background,

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:12.330 align:middle line:84%
religious background,
belief system.

01:27:12.330 --> 01:27:13.410 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:14.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a chemical reaction.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the facts of what happens
in the body and in the mind

01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and back to the body
and back to the mind.
