>>LISA GARR: Have you
ever had a dream that

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:84%
seems impossible to achieve,
a dream so big and so far away

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:84%
from your current reality
that you wouldn't even

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:90%
imagine speaking it?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was the case
with Tererai Trent.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
She grew up in a time
of unspeakable poverty

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:84%
in sub-Saharan Africa
when young girls

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
were forced to marry
at 14 years old,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
and have babies, and
remain illiterate.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Her unspeakable dream
was to gain an education

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
to break the cycle of poverty in
her family and in her village.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And today, Dr. Tererai Trent
is one of the most recognized

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
voices for quality education
and women's empowerment.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:10%
She has changed the lives of
generations of girls and women

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:10%
forever.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I am honored.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI TRENT: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have chills just in
saying all that I just said.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:90%
You have done so much.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%
So much.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
You just came from Zimbabwe
right here to be on our show.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TRENT: Yeah.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:90%
I arrived yesterday.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:10%
But you know, while I recognized
all the work that I have done,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:10%
but I stand on the shoulders
of many, many individuals.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:10%
>>TRENT: I couldn't
have done what

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:10%
I am doing without
the many angels that

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:10%
are out there that have
looked into my eyes,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.662 align:middle line:10%
saw something that I never
saw, and believed in my dreams.

00:01:58.662 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that beautiful?

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TRENT: Yeah.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:90%
And we all need that.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
We cannot do this alone,
anything we're doing.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Take me back to when you
were growing up in Zimbabwe.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:90%
What was your life like?

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TRENT: You know,
it's interesting,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
because I always
talk about coming

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:84%
from this long line of
generations of women who

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
had been married very young
before they could define

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:90%
their own dreams.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I was born in a country
that was known as Rhodesia.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And today we are
known as Zimbabwe.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And we were the last country
to gain our independence.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up during the war, the
war that liberated my country.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:10%
And what I remember
most is in the evening,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:10%
I would sit with my grandmother,
my mother, and other women

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:10%
around an open fire and
listen to these great stories,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:10%
heroic stories of
women surviving

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.340 align:middle line:10%
in a war-torn country, but women
who despite the fact that they

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:10%
were illiterate, but they were
the sheroes and the heroes

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:10%
of the community.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They had to
have endured so much.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TRENT: Yes.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to that circle
of sisterhood is unbreakable.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>TRENT: It is.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
It is, because,
collectively, when women--

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
when we come together and
we believe in a vision,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:90%
we can heal the world.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:90%
I talk about women.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:90%
We are the matriarchs.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:90%
We are the healers.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
We are the wisdom
whisperers, the ones

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:90%
who keep the community memory.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I read your book.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading about
these women's circles.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I
was a part of it.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And the stories that your
grandmother would tell,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
then your mother
would tell them.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was real though.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.806 align:middle line:90%
It was real about how you--

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
you had to cope
with this situation

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.900 align:middle line:90%
you were in in some way.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Was this a way to help you cope?

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.222 align:middle line:84%
>>TRENT: Yes, in many ways,
because I grew up with both

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:90%
my grandmother and my mother.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
They would always say
it's not your past that's

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
going to define
who you are but it

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:84%
is the dream, and the
vision, and the expectations

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:84%
of yourself that's going
to create that destiny.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talk about
when I was 18 years of age,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I was already a mother of four.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the babies
died as an infant

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
because I failed to
produce enough milk.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I was a child myself.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I was just following
the same pathway

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:84%
that generations of women
before me had traveled.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
My great-grandmother
was married off

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
when she was very
young, before she

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:90%
could define their own dreams.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother went through
the same and my mother.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I needed
to change my life.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.735 align:middle line:10%
I always talk about I always
visualize my great-grandmother

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:10%
when she was born,
because all these women

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:10%
that I'm talking about, we
were all exchanged for a cow,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:10%
because it's part of what
they call the culture.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother would always
say, no, it's not the culture.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.863 align:middle line:90%
It's a custom.

00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a different.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TRENT: There's a difference.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Culture is all-loving.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:90%
It's all-embracing.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TRENT: But a custom,
like the way in America

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:90%
you build a custom made house.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to sit
and say this is

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:90%
how I want to design my house.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Someone had to sit and say
this is how we can have women.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:90%
We can marry young.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
We can do all these things
because that's custom.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Culture is beautiful.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Help me understand
the custom, if you could.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I would like to understand
what is the custom that women

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%
need to marry young.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:84%
What was the situation with
the exchange and the poverty?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Explain this to me.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TRENT: Because we grew up--

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:90%
I grew up during the war.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
We were pretty much
oppressed and marginalized

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:84%
by the colonial system
that was in place, removed

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:84%
from fertile lands into
agricultural lands that

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:90%
were not even fertile.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of poverty
that was shaped by that.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And as a mechanism
to survive, the men

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
would find employment
in factories and mines.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And the women would remain
home taking care of kids.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
disparity that was

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
being shaped because men would
then get education because they

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:90%
are the breadwinners.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.610 align:middle line:90%
They would bring income.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:90%
And girls, what do you do?

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:90%
You are there to be married.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of girls were being
married very young before they

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:90%
could even get an education.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:10%
That was the era
where I was growing.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when I talk
about my grandmother,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.210 align:middle line:84%
my great-grandmother, she
was also married young.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And I always visualize
my great-grandmother

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.170 align:middle line:90%
when she was born.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:90%
She was born into this relay.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And I call that the
relay of poverty.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And she's running
holding this baton.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And I carry that
baton wherever I go.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:90%
She has this baton.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And she ran so fast
with this baton.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the baton
of early marriage,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
the baton of illiteracy, the
baton of the colonial system

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:90%
that never valued her.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.890 align:middle line:84%
She ran so fast with this
baton, my great-grandmother.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:10%
She hands it over to my mother--

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:10%
to my grandmother.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother grips
that baton of illiteracy,

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.470 align:middle line:90%
poverty, early marriage.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:90%
She runs with that baton.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:90%
She hands it over to my mother.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.480 align:middle line:84%
My mother grips that baton,
the baton of illiteracy.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:90%
She ran with that baton.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:90%
She hands it over to me.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:90%
And I say it's not my race.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not my baton.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I need to shift and
redefine this baton

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to
pass it on to my girls.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
What made you say that?

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TRENT: Because my
mother and my grandmother,

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
they would always
say, Tererai, now we

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:90%
have gained independence.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:90%
You have more choices.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to pass on
this ugly baton to your girls.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not your past that's
defining who you are.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I took that as
a moral responsibility,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because my grandmother
would always

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:90%
tell the story of great hunger.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.502 align:middle line:84%
The great hunger versus
the small hunger, yes.

00:09:31.502 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: And there are two
kinds of hungers in our lives.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:90%
There is the little hunger.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
The little hunger is all
about immediate gratification.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I want that, I want it now.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But the great hunger, which
is the greatest of all hunger

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:84%
is in our lives, its hunger
for meaning in our life.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I needed
meaning in my life.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Despite the fact that I had
been married when I was young,

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I had all these babies.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And now we are in an
independent country.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I needed to change
so we don't continue

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to pass the ugly baton
to the next generation.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You create a whole
other level of dreams.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yes.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which was what--
back to the women's circle,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:84%
back to the circle, when you're
a grandmother and your mother

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:90%
spoke of dreams--

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of goals, it
lit a fire in you.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Oh, it did, it did.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Because when we gained
independence, all of a sudden

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
in our communities we
begin to see Americans,

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Australians, these women
who looked like they

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:90%
were so empowered.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And they would always
come carrying their bags

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:90%
and wearing glasses.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And I would observe these
women, they would pick something

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
from their bag, like
a booklet, and they

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:84%
would wear those glasses and
they would talk to each other,

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:90%
put back those glasses.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And I would always
think wearing glasses

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
was a sign of education.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And I needed that.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So this one woman,
her name was Jo Luck,

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:84%
she came and found me with
other women sitting in a circle

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and asked one question that no
one had asked me in my life.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.150 align:middle line:90%
What are your dreams?

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:90%
What are your hopes?

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I am looking at
this woman, and I'm

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:84%
thinking, me, Tererai,
black woman, marginalized,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
running with my own ugly baton.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:90%
How am I suppose to dream?

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To dream, yeah, yeah.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: And she said yes,
if you believe in your dreams,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:90%
they are achievable.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want
to go to America.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:90%
I want to have an undergraduate.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:90%
I want to have a master's.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:90%
And I want to have a PhD.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:90%
There was silence.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You knew all
of that in that moment.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It just came out of you.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: Because all along,
when we gained independence,

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
local students from urban
areas, from the university,

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:84%
they would come
to our communities

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and they would talk
about these degrees.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Even the American women, some of
them were doing their research,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:84%
they would talk about these
degrees, undergraduate,

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
master's, PhD,
and I wanted that.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So the first dream
of going to America

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:84%
was inspired by Jo
Luck, this woman.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.963 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: Because
there was something

00:12:39.963 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
about these American
women, the way they walked,

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:90%
the way they carried themselves.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I could see dignity.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:84%
The way they looked right into
your eyes, whereas we poor

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
women who had been
silenced by early marriage,

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:84%
we would never look right into
your eyes, were always quiet.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted that dignity.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.358 align:middle line:84%
So I when I told her that, she
said yes, it is achievable.

00:13:11.358 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is achievable.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:90%
And you heard that.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: Yeah She used
the word [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:10%
In my language, it
means it is achievable.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:90%
That inspired me.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:90%
That's all I wanted.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's all you needed.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
As a poor mother, to hear
another woman looking

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:84%
into my eyes and say, yes,
your dreams are achievable.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:90%
We are social animals.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:90%
We need one another.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
We need another
woman who can say,

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:84%
you can stand on my
shoulders and you

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:90%
can achieve your dreams.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:90%
I ran into my mother.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I said I met someone who
made me believe in my dreams.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.685 align:middle line:84%
My mother looked at me, and
I think my mother saw hope.

00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:05.017 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, oh, the first time.

00:14:05.017 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: For the first
time, she saw hope.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: And she
said, if you believe

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
in what this stranger is saying
to you and you work hard,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and let's say you
achieve your dreams,

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:84%
not only are you defining
who you are as a woman,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
but you're also
defining every life that

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:84%
comes out of your womb
and generations to come.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From every other woman.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
You would-- you're so blessed
to have had a mother like that.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:84%
She could have said, no,
look at your circumstances.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You're never going
to get out of this.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever has.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:84%
But she was a
pinnacle part of that.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.588 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She knew what to say.

00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's sometimes
the challenge

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that we have when
we see poor people.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:84%
We think they are so poor
they can't think beyond what's

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.760 align:middle line:90%
here, despite the fact--

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I work with many
communities that are poor,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
but they want a better
life for themselves

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and for their children.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They don't
want a poor life.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: No.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.547 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is not a dream.

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: No, no.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The dream is
to break out of that.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But you also need to
want to do it yourself.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:90%
You had that.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: I wanted
to change my life.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you used to
read your brother's books.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.972 align:middle line:84%
So when my brother
was going to school--

00:15:33.972 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the boys
got to go to school.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.013 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: The boys, they were--

00:15:37.013 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:90%
they had to go to school.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And my brother,
for some reasons,

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.185 align:middle line:90%
he never wanted to go to school.

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that must
have bothered you.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: It did.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So he would come--
one day I remember

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.870 align:middle line:84%
he came home with this book
and he called it geography.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, geography.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I opened that book and I saw
pictures and I saw words.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I cried.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know
what these words were

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:90%
saying about these pictures.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:10%
And I said to my
brother, help me read.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK, I will.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He did.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: But you
will pay for it.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: And I had no idea
how I was going to pay for it.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So he would teach me how to read
by making me practice vowels

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and alphabets and he would
see there's the Mrs. Vowel

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:90%
and there is the Mr. Alphabet.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:90%
You need to marry these two.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: So he would teach
me amai, which is mother.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So I would look at
the vowels, there's A.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, now
look to the alphabets.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:84%
You'll find M, M, go back, find
A. Amai, and there's the I.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I learned
it, like I was sewing words.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And before long I was
able to read and write.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
My brother says, can
you do my homework?

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.447 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was the payment.

00:17:15.447 --> 00:17:16.848 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:16.848 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:90%
And you were happy to do.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: I was happy
to do it, but my writing

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.599 align:middle line:84%
wasn't that good, so
the teacher discovered

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't my brother
doing the homework, it was me.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And he advocated
for me, so when I

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
talk about standing on
the shoulders of many--

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.340 align:middle line:10%
>>TERERAI: He came and
convinced my father

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:10%
and I would end
up going to school

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:10%
and got my little
bit of education.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I was already an
older student by then.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:90%
So when I--

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You were eager.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: I was, I was eager.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I remember going to school
with no shoes, with nothing.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I never cared.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Even when I came to America, I
was always the oldest student

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
in every class that I
attended, sometimes older

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
than the professor
herself or himself.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But I never cared,
because I knew

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I was on a journey to break this
cycle, the vicious cycle that

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.068 align:middle line:90%
runs deep within my family.

00:18:28.068 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so much--

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: To change that baton.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So much deeper than
just getting an education.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
You had a mission and
a journey and a dream

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and you were going
to achieve it.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One person told
you it was possible

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:90%
and you believed it.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yes.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we need
that one person.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, also need
to have that belief in you

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:90%
that it ignited.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And your journey,
how long did it

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
take you to get to the PhD
level, which is phenomenal?

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: Oh my
goodness, 20 years.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 20 years.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: 20 years.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You didn't give up?

00:19:01.465 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: No, I never gave up.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Because when I told my
mother about my dreams,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that I had discussed
with Jo Luck, she said,

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
write down those
dreams and bury them.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
The word bury and plant
are the same in my culture.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Bury them, bury your dreams
deep down under the ground

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:84%
the same way we bury
the umbilical cord.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:84%
I come from a culture
where when a child is

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.120 align:middle line:84%
born the female
elders of the village,

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
they take the mother's old dress
and they take a small piece.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:84%
They cut the baby's
umbilical cord,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:84%
tie that umbilical cord
in this piece of dress,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:84%
bury it deep down
under the ground,

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
with the belief that when this
child grows, wherever they go,

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
whatever happens in their life,
the umbilical cord will always

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
remind them of
their birth place.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Rituals are important
in our lives.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: They
ground our faith.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
My mother said, bury your dreams
deep down under the ground.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you go, despite
the abuse in your life,

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
despite the poverty
in your life,

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
those dreams will always
remind you of their importance,

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:84%
that you're needed to
redefine the ugly baton.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:90%
So I had my four dreams.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you were--well,
through this journey, that is--

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:84%
first of all, tradition
is so, so vital.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
We've lost so much of
that in this country.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And that's so
beautiful, because the dream

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:10%
will grow and remember where it
came from, where its roots are.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: It does.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
probably needed that,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.200 align:middle line:84%
because as I read in your book,
you were challenged through

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
your whole education by the
husband who did not want you

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --to do that.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: Yeah, but the
fact that I had my dreams

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:84%
buried deep down,
that gave me hope.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.533 align:middle line:90%
That give me grounding.

00:21:06.533 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
true meaning of hope.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: Whenever
I needed to give up,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I would always think
about those dreams

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:90%
that I knew were growing.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have quite
a destiny, my friend.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Thank you.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It just
comes through you.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever thought about
that, about why you're here

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and what your real,
true purpose is

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and how it was this
purpose all along?

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: You know,
when you listen

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
to the Native Americans
in this country,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
they say humankind has
not woven the web of life.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:90%
We are but one thread within it.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we do to the web,
we do it to ourselves.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:90%
All things are bound together.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:90%
All things are connected.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Our very survival is connected
to the survival of others.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I knew from my grandmother
that we are not

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:84%
scattered here on earth just
for the sake of just being here.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:84%
We came here on
earth for a purpose.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:90%
We have to find our purpose.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I talk
about the great hunger

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:90%
by asking what breaks my heart.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It is in those moments
of our brokenness,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
in those moments when
we dig deep within us,

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
we begin to find a
stirring leading us

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.980 align:middle line:90%
to our purpose in this life.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Because collectively we
can change the world.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The silencing of one woman
is our collective silencing.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But the awakening of women, it
is the healing of the world.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
We can heal the world
by finding our purpose.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And not just
a single soul purpose.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It has to be, as your mother
said, collectively interwoven.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:90%

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:84%
to get a master's,
get a PhD, and I

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:84%

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
so profound that just
changed my whole life.

Your dreams will
have greater meaning

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:84%
when they are tied to the
betterment of your community.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not only about our
personal goals in life

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
or the personal
financial goals in life,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:84%
but it is about how
our personal goals are

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:90%
connected to the greater good.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the secret
to our success.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what

educate a community,

we change the narrative.

>>TERERAI: I never
saw that coming,

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:84%
because when I got
invited to come back,

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:84%
the producers said
this is not the time

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about your
dreams and what have you.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.540 align:middle line:84%
You're just coming
in because Oprah

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:84%
is coming to the
end of her season

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and she is just
inviting everybody.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:10%
It's just like a get
together, so it's not

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:14.020 align:middle line:10%
like you're going to go
to Oprah and say this

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:10%
is my dream, no, no, no, no.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Remember, you are a guest.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And the producer was
very clear about that.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when I arrived at
the studios I was like,

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going for a get
together party or something.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden they
are saying, we are going--

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:90%
look at those double doors .

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.600 align:middle line:90%
We are going to count.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we say 10,
they are going to open

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and you are going to
walk in and join others.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So I walked in thinking I'm
joining others who are already

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:90%
into this get together party.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And gosh, I see Oprah standing
there with her arms wide open.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said
something, you're going

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
to go in history as
my favorite guest.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
is this again?

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And we sit down and she's
asking, what are your dreams?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, the producer
said I shouldn't say something.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
But then I said, this
is an opportunity.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to keep quiet.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm reclaiming my voice.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:33.758 align:middle line:84%
And I told her about
building schools.

You know, before this

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that I attended was
built long, long time

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
ago during the colonial
system, the colonial era.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
No child from that school
had gone to university.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.640 align:middle line:84%

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
empower a mother, she is more
likely to empower her daughter.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
creating, I started

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
creating this employment
platform for the mothers

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:90%

They may be illiterate,
poor, but they have skills.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So they started putting
on this beautiful jewelry

00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:01.480 align:middle line:84%

tuitions for their girls.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:90%

They are not going to go

It's a skill.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a trade.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Exactly.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:23.893 align:middle line:90%

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's re-educating
an entire generation.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Oh, yeah.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And so on.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And now there are statistics
that we hear of all the time,

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:43.690 align:middle line:84%
55% of women in the region of
Africa are attending school.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:84%
There's these
statistics, but they grow

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and they change
every single day.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: They do, they do.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:55.450 align:middle line:10%
And especially when you
focus and educate more girls,

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:10%
you change the whole generation.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.000 align:middle line:90%
There's power in that.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.920 align:middle line:84%
In our schools, they
are public schools,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:90%
we educate both boys and girls.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But what has been
fascinating for me

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is to see girls
outperforming boys.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And I am-- and they
are so determined.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like you were.

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yes.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because, also,
they see me in the community.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:84%
At least they can see a
role model and they can say,

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I want to be just like her.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen older men coming,
holding their eight-year-old

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:84%
daughters and looking into
my eyes and say, Tererai,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:90%
can she be just like you?

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:84%
And I realize in those moments
that not only are we providing

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:47.320 align:middle line:84%
quality education, but we
are helping communities

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:84%

importance of educating girls

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:90%

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

>>LISA: Visualize?

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: Every day,
because I grew up

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:20.170 align:middle line:84%
with a grandmother who
said it's important for you

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:84%
to own your own rituals,
because rituals, they ground us.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.260 align:middle line:84%
They provide that space
to grow our faith.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So every day, 4:00
AM, I have to be up

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and I do what I
call fierce writing.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I write and I write anything
that comes to my mind.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm finding it is in those
hours where I am more creative.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:90%
I visualize every day.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:84%
When I buried my
dreams, my grandmother

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%
would say go to that place where
you have buried your dreams,

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:10.600 align:middle line:84%
sit still, visualize as
though you're already

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.500 align:middle line:90%
living that life.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And I would visualize myself
getting into an aeroplane,

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:90%
coming to America.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:10%
I'd never seen an aeroplane,
I'd never been in an aeroplane.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The only aeroplane that I
knew were war helicopters

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that would come into
the communities.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So I would find myself
sitting into that helicopter.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It would take me to this
place called America.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would visualize
these tall buildings

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and see myself carrying
books and attending classes.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Visualize getting my
undergraduate, my master's,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and my PhD.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Visualize going back,
building schools.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Visualize little girls
attending schools

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.110 align:middle line:90%
and gaining their education.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The day that I went
into that aeroplane,

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:09.010 align:middle line:84%
there was this deja vu feeling
that I've been here before.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So the power of daily rituals
is important in my life.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I talk about rituals, I
breathe rituals, I am rituals.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:25.580 align:middle line:84%

I bury my dreams in the women

I'm tired of digging the ground.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:13.090 align:middle line:84%
what it is shaping in our lives,

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:31.440 align:middle line:90%
soul wounds do you carry?

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Is this what's shaping you?

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And shaping the
lives of your children.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when we are silent about
that, we pass on that silencing

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:84%
to the next generation,
to our children.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: So I provide
those tools for women

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to really dig deep and
tap into those traumas

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and then we begin
to find healing.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've recently gone
through this experience of--

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:07.440 align:middle line:84%
my father passed very
recently, and my relationship

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
with my mother, as a
result, is deepening.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Because she is reverting back
to every story of her childhood,

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm learning and unweaving
why she repeated the patterns

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.100 align:middle line:90%
from her mother.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And why her mother
repeated those patterns

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.410 align:middle line:90%
from her mother.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And as I'm
going through this--

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.208 align:middle line:84%
you know, one would
think that this

00:42:32.208 --> 00:42:36.120 align:middle line:84%
is a time of grieving, but it's
a time of massive expansion

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.970 align:middle line:90%
and learning the generations.

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And then I look for--

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I look at my daughter, and
I think how am I repeating--

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:48.617 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: The same pattern.

00:42:48.617 --> 00:42:50.325 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Yes.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.410 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: They're deep.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:84%

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:00.970 align:middle line:90%
refusing to go to that depth.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But what we are missing is
we're missing our healing.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We live it, though,
every day, like you did.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:84%
You coped and coped

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.290 align:middle line:90%
found coping mechanisms.

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Rarely, I

>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that it
doesn't go into--

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.640 align:middle line:84%
it was a pattern
of deep control.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yes, yes.

>>TERERAI: Exactly, exactly.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I'm looking

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm conscious of it.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:45.902 align:middle line:90%
You have to be conscious of it.

00:43:45.902 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: You have
to, you have to.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be able
to tell these stories.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Because when you dig deep
and tell those stories

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
your own daughter

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and tell her the
stories, she'll begin

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:07.780 align:middle line:84%

is never to be repeated.

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know, this is the
first time my mom's really

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:90%
told the stories.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.298 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because she's
been caring for my father

00:44:14.298 --> 00:44:16.660 align:middle line:84%
for so long and he's
been sick for so long.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And she always
had cared for him.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And so finally she
gets her voice heard.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.260 align:middle line:84%

>>TERERAI: Reclaiming our
voices, it's very important.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I always tell women
you don't claim the voice.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.900 align:middle line:90%
You already have the voice.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Somehow that voice has
been silenced because

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:middle line:90%
of these generational patterns.

They silence our voice.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You need to reach a point
where you are conscious

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.440 align:middle line:90%

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.220 align:middle line:84%

to my mother and to me, but in
the passing of that ugly baton,

to the forefront when

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:10.090 align:middle line:84%

And in many

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that don't have Oprah to

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.750 align:middle line:84%
you tell people whose

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.160 align:middle line:84%
for the dream, or they

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.190 align:middle line:90%
what could you tell them to do?

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: You know,
for me, even when

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Oprah came into my

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:37.090 align:middle line:84%
on a journey for my own
redemption and my own healing,

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.640 align:middle line:84%
because my grandmother

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.680 align:middle line:84%
were telling me about the
importance of owning my voice.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:53.170 align:middle line:84%
does your voice match this

the energy of the dream?

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TERERAI: Because it is a story

It is a story that makes
us a victim, sometimes.

I am not a victim.

And the way to
reshape that narrative

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.220 align:middle line:84%
so that I define
who I am, I have

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.820 align:middle line:84%

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:23.860 align:middle line:84%

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.460 align:middle line:84%
There's beauty in our
own vulnerability,

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.700 align:middle line:84%
when we can face it and
say this is who I am.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:02.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, in my culture
when we greet one another,

we say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
I see you.

And your response is,
I am here to be seen.

With all my ugliness, with all
my wounds and with all my joy,

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:21.670 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: And I appreciate you.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.762 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask, for
you going forward,

00:49:57.762 --> 00:49:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and I know that it's
not an easy journey,

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to carry on a foundation and
to carry through this schools.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to carry
on the funding.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Yeah.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your biggest
why, in present time.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.465 align:middle line:84%
If you could share that with
me, what is the biggest why?

00:50:15.465 --> 00:50:17.530 align:middle line:90%
What moves you every day?

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TERERAI: Why?

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:21.610 align:middle line:90%
The ugly baton.

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:23.770 align:middle line:90%
That's my why.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:84%
We find redemption in
what breaks our heart.

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:29.290 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.300 align:middle line:90%
I was married young.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to see anyone to
go through what I went through.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.440 align:middle line:90%
And that addresses my why.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.250 align:middle line:10%
I wake up every
day knowing I have

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.790 align:middle line:10%
a moral and a sacred
responsibility.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Because my mother
said here on Earth,

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:54.940 align:middle line:84%
we are climbing an
invisible ladder.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.660 align:middle line:84%
This ladder is so tall
but it's invisible.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.550 align:middle line:90%
It is rungs.

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:03.560 align:middle line:84%
There are others who are
at the bottom of the rung

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and there are others who
are at the top of the rung.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.360 align:middle line:90%
I am at the top of that rung.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would always
say, the invisible ladder,

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:17.260 align:middle line:90%
it has its own invisible laws.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.740 align:middle line:10%
You have the moral obligation,
because you are there

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:25.510 align:middle line:10%
at the top, to pull up
those who are at the bottom.

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:31.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
living beautiful for me.

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:90%
That's what addresses my why.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.050 align:middle line:90%

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:35.925 align:middle line:90%
