00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and we are coming to you
live from Gaiam studios

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:90%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And since this is a
live, interactive show,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to
communicate with us

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.334 align:middle line:90%
on Facebook and Twitter.

00:00:32.334 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Give us your comments.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.208 align:middle line:90%
Give us your questions.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:84%
We'll be asking them
throughout the show.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you,
are you eating

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:84%
enough fruits and
vegetables a day?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
The recommended daily amount
of fruits and vegetables

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:90%
is five servings a day.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is a serving?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Is a carrot a serving?

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Is a glass of fruit juice
count as a juice serving?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
The American Cancer
Society actually

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
recommends double that
amount of intake of food--

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.427 align:middle line:84%
should be more than half of
your daily intake of food.

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So-- that's fruits and
vegetables should be.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%
So why is that?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Why does the American
Cancer Society

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
recommend fruits and vegetables
should be more than half

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.564 align:middle line:90%
of your daily intake of food?

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:14.105 align:middle line:84%
Today, my guest is
Victoria Boutenko.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
She is a raw
foodist, and she has

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:90%
some of those answers for us.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:84%
She's provided so
much in her books,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
"Green for Life," her
bestselling books,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and has been doing this for 25
years in the raw food movement.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.235 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me today.

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA BOUTENKO:
My pleasure.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we have-- there's
so much great information that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
comes with your stories and what
you have to say about raw food

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and why it makes so
much sense to you.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how you got
started in this,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
because you weren't
always a raw foodist.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.605 align:middle line:84%
About 19 years ago, we went
on raw food as a family.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:84%
What happened is when we came
to United States 25 years ago--

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
we immigrated from
the Soviet Union,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:84%
which was very hungry
country at that time--

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:84%
we were so food deprived
that we went for the food.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And we thought that America is
the most healthiest countries

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:84%
in the world and that it's
so scientifically measured

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:90%
and proven.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And the wealthiest countries
should be the healthiest.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So I felt fine eating anything
in bright, colored packages.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't really limit myself.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.797 align:middle line:84%
And one year later, we
started to become sick.

00:02:21.797 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And then in the
year of 1994-- 1993 and 1994-

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.732 align:middle line:90%
we became so ill.

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I developed arrhythmia,
which is irregular heartbeat.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The disease that took
my father's life.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:90%
And gained lots of weight.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
My husband developed rheumatoid
arthritis and hyperthyroidism.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.655 align:middle line:84%
So his eyes were bulgy
and he started to shake

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:90%
and became red faced.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter, she
developed asthma.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:90%
And my son developed diabetes.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother died
from overdose of insulin,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:84%
so I was so afraid that
something will happen to him.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.456 align:middle line:90%
So my scare of that--

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your health crisis.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.054 align:middle line:84%
The whole family
being in crisis.

00:03:03.054 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And my
oldest son was lucky.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:90%
He was living separately.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:90%
He didn't go on raw food.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:90%
He was not getting sick.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you directly
correlate all of the illnesses

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:90%
to the food?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.521 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: I do.

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Processed food.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't realize
that processed food

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
is processed food, no matter
what wealthy country is it.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the move that you
made was relatively overnight,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:90%
wasn't it?

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:90%
You just--

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.345 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No.

00:03:26.345 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
For awhile, I didn't know what.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
First, I went to
the doctor, and they

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
said Sergie has
to go on insulin.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And I have very
good education, so I

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
went to the medical library and
I checked out medical-- a book

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.442 align:middle line:84%
about diabetes, a
thick book, and I

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
saw-- I read on the
first page, there

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
is no known cure
and no known cause.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, so
what is that book then,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
if there's no known
cure and cause?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But I read it anyways, and
I became even more scared

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:90%
of insulin.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Then I found book by
Dr. Julian Whitaker,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and he said that in
order to reduce the blood

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
sugar in the blood,
to increase insulin,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:90%
we need to do aerobic exercise.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Running is the best.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the next day I bought
running shoes for my son

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and for me, because I
realized nine-year-old

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
will not start
running on his own.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:90%
So we started running.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.508 align:middle line:84%
And his blood sugar
became better.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:19.424 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With exercise.

00:04:19.424 --> 00:04:20.799 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And
then Dr. Whitaker

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
also said to reduce or take
out any meat and dairy.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And dairy was
really a big thing.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
When I removed
dairy from his diet,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:84%
his blood sugar
went even better.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.311 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So I thought I could
pull time longer and experiment

00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:90%
I was encouraged.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I met a lady
who was a raw foodist.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that raw
food could reverse diabetes.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know, but I
decided to see what I could do.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So then, pretty fast--
January 21, 1994,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:90%
we became a raw food family.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I simply turned off
the pilot in the stove.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Kids went to school.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:90%
My husband went to work.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I just covered the stove
with a huge cutting board

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and threw away everything
cooked and went

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and bought some bananas
and wax-covered apples.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about organic.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:90%
And whatever I knew to eat.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Didn't buy no greens.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know-- I
didn't like greens.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And we became raw fooders.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.761 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, in a sense,
after you did your research,

00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
it was an overnight
change for the family.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Was that a difficult--

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: That was overnight.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:90%
It was a cold tofurkey.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A cold tofurkey.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.886 align:middle line:90%
Was it shocking to your family?

00:05:30.886 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It
was shocking, yes.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:90%
It was shocking for children.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:90%
They revolted.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Sergie said, I would rather
give myself insulin shots

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life than
take this crazy diet.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
People will humiliate
me at school.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And he was revolting, and
Valya was also joining him.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But as long as
they became hungry,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and they came to the
kitchen, and I gave them

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:84%
bananas and apples,
and they were

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
so that they
started eating them.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have choice.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I didn't give them choice.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So next morning,
surprisingly, we already

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:90%
felt somewhat better.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:90%
We felt totally crazy.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.139 align:middle line:84%
And I told them,
don't tell anybody.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't know what
to expect from people.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.596 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I understand
that you even

00:06:08.596 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
got a visit from
the social services?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, but
they told other people.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Somehow it leaked out.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And the neighbor--
I don't even know

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
which neighbor-- called
on social services.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And we barely ever left
our children at home,

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
but somehow they-- I don't
know if they were waiting there

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:90%
around the corner.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
We went-- me and my husband
went to the next door office

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:90%
to pick up something.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we left, two
ladies walked into the house.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And as my children
told me, there

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
were two unhealthy
looking ladies,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
smelled like cigarettes, and
because such kind of people

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
came and they were
talking in such kind

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
of different serious way,
Sergie felt intuitively

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:90%
that he's in trouble.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And so he just lied to them.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So the lady said,
darling, tell me,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:90%
what did you have for dinner?

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we just
came from McDonald's.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
came to his mind.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.712 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there was a
fake call from neighbors,

00:07:05.712 --> 00:07:06.295 align:middle line:90%
and they left.

00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:07.055 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.055 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.385 align:middle line:84%
So he told them that
he ate cooked food

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:10.885 align:middle line:84%
so that he would
not get in trouble.

00:07:10.885 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: He,
somehow, intuitively

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.057 align:middle line:84%
he felt that these ladies
didn't come with good news.

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: And he lied.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why did
those people think

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.015 align:middle line:90%
that raw food was so unhealthy?

00:07:23.015 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I think
that because it's not

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:90%
supported by government.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And so we became--
I became so scared of that.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want my children
to be lost or taken from me.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I actually finished
the business,

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:90%
closed the business I had.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I had several
businesses at that time.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:90%
And we started traveling.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
For 2 1/2 years, we were
living out of a van,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
homeless and unemployed, because
I didn't want to live in one

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.375 align:middle line:90%
place more than 30 days.

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want--

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you stayed
committed to the raw food diet?

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: We were staying
committed, maybe too long.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And were people--
were you feeling better?

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Was your family getting better?

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.261 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: We felt-- in
the first several years,

00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:90%
we felt fantastic.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely fantastic.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:84%
We ran 10,000K, in the
10K race in Boulder.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you did heal
your family from this?

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: We
healed our family.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies healed us.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.775 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now, you combine--
and what I love about Victoria

00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
is that she makes this
very simple for us.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And introducing a smoothie, a
green smoothie or a green drink

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:84%
to your diet is a
great way to start.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if at the
time you were 100% raw,

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:84%
but this is a good way
for maybe a beginner

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to start with
something like this.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Why do you combine the
fruits and the vegetables

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:90%
in your smoothies?

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.821 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The green
smoothies came later.

00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
We stayed on the raw food
diet 100% for too long.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend it
to anybody anymore.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I say, begin with
green smoothies.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Don't change whatever
you eat, but add

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.841 align:middle line:84%
one quart of green smoothie
every day to your diet.

00:08:55.841 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And I don't ever
combined fruits and vegetables.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't consider that
greens are vegetables.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:84%
They have different
content than,

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:90%
like, say carrots or beets.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:90%
They don't have starch.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And so greens could be
combined with anything.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:90%
With any product.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The leafy greens.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.820 align:middle line:90%
As long as they're leafy greens.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I call
greens something

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.601 align:middle line:90%
you can roll around the finger.

00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Not green Granny Smith
apples or cucumbers.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So the leafy greens could
be combined with anything,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
because they have very
low amount of starch.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they also
have a very, very high--

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.172 align:middle line:84%
and they're very rich
in vitamins and--

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Everything.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
In all essential vitamins,
essential nutrients,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:90%
and proteins and everything.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's protein that
you can find in vegetables?

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.788 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Like, for
example, vegetables

00:09:40.788 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:84%
have only up to 6%
to 7% of protein.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:90%
They're really low.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fruits do?

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Fruits
and root vegetables

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:90%
have very little protein.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But the green vegetables have
a lot of protein, up to 40%.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why horses and
cows, they eat greens.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.717 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.717 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They get their protein--

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Mustangs in the wild
nature eat 5 kilos of greens.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:84%
It will be 10 pounds
of greens per day.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which green
leafy vegetable

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.525 align:middle line:90%
has the most amount of protein?

00:10:05.525 --> 00:10:05.959 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: According
to my research,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:90%
it's red leaf lettuce.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Red leaf lettuce.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: But also I
remember that spinach also

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:90%
is high in protein.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:84%
They're all about
39%, 40%, 41%, 42%.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
research you can find on?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.855 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: On
nutritiondata.com, which

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:24.866 align:middle line:84%
is a government
supported website.

00:10:24.866 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So these smoothies are
absolutely beautiful.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be making
the smoothies a little bit

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:90%
later in the show.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:90%
We'll have a live demonstration.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.645 align:middle line:84%
You'll see how easy it is to

>>BOUTENKO: Easy,
most palatable,

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
practical, delicious

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.854 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: And most nutritious.

00:10:40.854 --> 00:10:42.811 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Take a look at
some of these smoothies.

00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They're absolutely beautiful,
what Victoria does.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.504 align:middle line:84%
She really makes food
as art, essentially.

00:10:47.504 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:90%
They're just gorgeous.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
This particular one
is layered with-- what

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.340 align:middle line:84%
is that-- mango and then
kiwi and strawberry.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And there is, in each
one of these smoothies,

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.670 align:middle line:90%
there's also green juices.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:00.712 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Green leaves.

00:11:00.712 --> 00:11:01.586 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Green leaves.

00:11:01.586 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:90%
A lot of those.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.281 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And I
added psyllium husk

00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to make them look
like a pudding.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.610 align:middle line:84%
To hold-- to be firm, so
that I could do layers.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now in the-- when
you were combining the fruits

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and the green leafy
vegetables, that

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
doesn't complicate the
digestive system at all?

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It actually helps.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Because, for example,
sugar in the fruit.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.407 align:middle line:84%
It could be too much
for your system.

00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Alone.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: But the insoluble
fiber and chlorophyll,

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
they both slow down
absorption of sugar.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that doesn't
give you any sugar rush.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
My son was diagnosed
with juvenile diabetes

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
at the age of nine, but he eats
green smoothies all the time.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
In the last three
years, I had conducted

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
15 retreats-- green smoothie,
one week long retreats--

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
in different parts of
the world, and usually

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:84%
have up to 70 people
at these retreats.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And everybody-- diabetics and
people with candida and people

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
with sugar intolerance,
people with hyperglycemia--

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
they consumed this
fruit smoothies

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:90%
with greens no problem.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the greens
actually balance out

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:90%
the glycemic index of the fruit?

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.199 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:11.199 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And also because
sunlight performs

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
in our body as insulin,
so do the greens

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
because chlorophyll is nothing
but liquefied sunshine.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when diabetics consume
chlorophyll in any form,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:90%
it balances their blood sugar.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:90%
It works as insulin.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
levels of damage

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to pancreas in different
diabetic conditions.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And some people
could reverse it,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and some people could just
reduce the amount of insulin

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:90%
they take.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.563 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So one of our Facebook
questions coming in is saying,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
do the green juices actually
help you reduce fatigue?

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Green
smoothies on its own

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
might not reduce-- they might
reduce, but not eliminate.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
For the fatigue,
you need to rest.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:90%
You need to sleep.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:90%
You need to--

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.656 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Simply stated.

00:12:59.656 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: --let your
adrenal glands rest.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And also you need
to go to bed early.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.049 align:middle line:84%
Because adrenals only
rest from 11:00 to 1:00.

00:13:07.049 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't sleep
from 11:00 to 1:00--

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
if you work at that
time-- then you

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:90%
do accumulate adrenal fatigue.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah hah.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And so-- but the
green smoothies, of course,

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.545 align:middle line:90%
they take care of your health.

00:13:17.545 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
They nourish you and detox you.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.466 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a difference
between green smoothies

00:13:21.466 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and green juices.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.926 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: There
is a difference.

00:13:23.926 --> 00:13:26.162 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you advocate
the green smoothie.

00:13:26.162 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:90%
The blended ones.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: For many reasons.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:28.538 align:middle line:90%
For many reasons.

00:13:28.538 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:84%
However, I do
sometimes make juice.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:90%
On a hot summer day, I do.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I prefer smoothie because
it's very practical.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I've been juicing for
years before I figured out

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:90%
the smoothies.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And it does take
commitment, because it

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:90%
takes about an hour or more.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.495 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to make juice
for the whole family,

00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:49.107 align:middle line:90%
it could take up to four hours.

00:13:49.107 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because you-- yes.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: And it's expensive.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you
lose all of the fiber.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.606 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And then you
throw away the fiber.

00:13:54.606 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I've learned what
a magical sponge the fiber is--

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:84%
it looks, under
microscope, like a sponge.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And it absorbs
toxins from your body

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in your sewage
system-- in the colon.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Then why throw away fiber?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:90%
We don't consume enough fiber.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to,
even according to USDA,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
consume 30 grams
of fiber per day,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:84%
but average American
consumes 10 to 12.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:90%
That's not enough.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You cannot be healthy
if you don't detox.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the
proper elimination system.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.603 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's
take a look at this clip

00:14:21.603 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
because it shows 15
smoothies in three minutes

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:90%
and how easy it is to do.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:84%
You can visit rawfamily.com

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:90%
all the 15 different recipes.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.389 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be doing some
more demonstrations later

00:17:30.389 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:90%
on in the show.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So these smoothies,
and green juices

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:84%
in general, and green
foods in general,

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
are meant to improve
people's health.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Overall there has been an
enormous body of evidence

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:90%
around this.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, how does-- how
much do you have to cook food,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
or at what temperature
do you start

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:90%
losing that quality of health?

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you start to turn the
enzymes into something

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:90%
that is no longer healthy?

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.132 align:middle line:90%
At what temperature?

00:17:57.132 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Anything
that is hotter

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:84%
than the human body could
take is-- that's cooking.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.974 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So over 98 degrees?

00:18:05.974 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you prepare cooked
raw food-- for example,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
dehydrated-- you have to go
by the region where it grows.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
it's a pineapple,

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
pineapple grows in hot places
such as Australia or equator.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So they could tolerate
100, 110 degrees.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can dehydrate
them at that.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Or if you take
tomato, it has to be

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:90%
dehydrated at lower temperature.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's banana,
it could go higher.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So you can go with natural--
you can think about this.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:90%
And where it grows.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you
put me in hot water,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I won't be able to
teach the lecture.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:90%
I will be cooked.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So, it has to be you
go with the human body.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be, probably
could tolerate up to 100.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.309 align:middle line:84%
But then after that,
it's not functioning.

00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's
various different types

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.933 align:middle line:84%
of smoothie recipes
that you've put together

00:18:56.933 --> 00:18:58.046 align:middle line:90%
for overall health.

00:18:58.046 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about a few
later on in the show, about how

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
to improve the digestive system.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's one that
you put together

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that's a liver
type of a cleanse.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.775 align:middle line:90%
Liver is special.

00:19:07.775 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:84%
The entire blood of human
body, every two minutes,

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:90%
is filtered through the liver.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So when we're born,
our liver is clean.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:90%
It's like a filter.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
You change your air
filter in the car

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
regularly, and the oil
filter, but we don't ever

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:90%
cleanse the liver.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And after years of use, it's all
full of different cholesterol

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of plugs, and
liver ducts are plugged.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So this smoothie will make
liver-- activates liver.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Makes it work.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's liver cleanse.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And it involves usually
dandelion and milk thistle

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.212 align:middle line:90%
and some ginger.

00:19:41.212 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, now,
the liver cleanses

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.044 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of in
the past or I've

00:19:44.044 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
done in the past have
been olive oil and garlic.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.584 align:middle line:84%
And those are very,
very hard to get down.

00:19:49.584 --> 00:19:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: They're
hard, and they

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:90%
could be harsh on the body.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And I personally think they
could be violent on the body.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:90%
They are very harsh.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:90%
So this you recommend.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, your son--

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You don't
even feel anything.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:84%
You just know that it
activates your liver.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.162 align:middle line:90%
You feel better afterwards.

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
mentioned dandelion.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.078 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
main ingredients.

00:20:07.078 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Why, specifically, dandelion?

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Dandelion
had antioxidants in it.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:90%
They're bitter.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:90%
It gives them bitter taste.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:90%
That is activating.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:90%
It's stimulating the liver.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so, also,
there's dandelion.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.299 align:middle line:90%
There's milk thistle.

00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And what properties
does milk thistle

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:90%
have that help the liver?

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: The same.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.521 align:middle line:90%
Antioxidants.

00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:24.325 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.325 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Antioxidants.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.991 align:middle line:90%
And there's endive.

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:26.649 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.649 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Endive.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:90%
They're bitter.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Again, antioxidants.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.184 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know your son is a
big fan of the wild edibles.

00:20:33.184 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You, too, as well.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.703 align:middle line:90%
He probably learned it from you.

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I actually want to
mention, you have an app.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.712 align:middle line:84%
You have a mobile app
for green smoothies.

00:20:41.712 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: For green
smoothies and for wild edibles.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:90%
We have two apps.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.799 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's so great.

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So people, the wild--
the green smoothies app,

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
you basically can just look
up in the market various

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:90%
vegetables--

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It covers all green
smoothie-- all major greens

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and fruits that are available
in most markets of the world.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.002 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Greens.

00:20:59.002 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: And greens.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And it tells what this
particular green or food

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:90%
is good for.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it good for osteoporosis
or for liver cleanse

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
or for anything.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And also, it offers you
different recipes with them.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And it provides you with the
nutrition data completely.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:90%
How many calories.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:90%
How much iron.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.030 align:middle line:90%
How much of anything in there.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.885 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is so
practical and so great.

00:21:18.885 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Very,
very practical.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:90%
I use it myself.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.910 align:middle line:84%
If I go to the store, and I
know I have endive at home,

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I just look.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.742 align:middle line:90%
What else can I do with it?

00:21:25.742 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a whole education
right there for your family.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And your son also
created one for the--

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: The wild edible app.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Because wild edibles are
not just something exotic.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.216 align:middle line:84%
It's a regional food
that we came from.

00:21:38.216 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, not
many people know

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
that Romaine is
cultivated dandelions.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, it is?

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It came
from dandelions.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And so going to wild is going
to-- going away from processed,

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.980 align:middle line:90%
from hybridized.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Back to nature.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It's something really
we can count on.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:56.725 align:middle line:90%
Its nature.

00:21:56.725 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:90%
It's where we belong.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a whole
demonstration in this clip

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to show you
of her son, Sergie, making

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.087 align:middle line:90%
a wild edible smoothie.

00:22:05.087 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>Purslane is one
of few plants that

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:90%
are rich in omega 3 fatty acids.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:84%
It's high in vitamin A,
B6, vitamin C, minerals,

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
calcium, iron, magnesium,
phosphorus, potassium, copper,

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:90%
and manganese.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Purslane-- as well
as lamb's quarters,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
which is the next
slide-- are two

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:90%
weeds the plague organic farms.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has become
customary in my family

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to seek out organic farmers
who have a purslane and lamb's

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
quarters problem and
ask them if we might

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
be able to help them weed and
collect some of these weeds

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
for free so that we can
use them in smoothies.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.226 align:middle line:84%
You can also go onto
seedsofchange.com

00:22:49.226 --> 00:22:51.305 align:middle line:90%
and order wild edible seeds.

00:22:51.305 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.090 align:middle line:90%
seedsofchange.com.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want any
guesswork, you actually

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.205 align:middle line:84%
plant these seeds in your
garden and grow wild edibles.

00:23:03.205 --> 00:23:05.010 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.970 align:middle line:84%
This is what we often
do in our garden.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:07.947 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.947 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this
is lamb's quarters.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:10.540 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And lamb's quarters really
likes dry, arid areas.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:90%
It likes to grow in the sun.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So chances are, if you have
a vacant lot or a ditch

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:84%
around your neighborhood
or just a field,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.065 align:middle line:84%
you can find lamb's
quarters there.

00:23:23.065 --> 00:23:24.395 align:middle line:90%
It grows pretty big.

00:23:24.395 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And its identifying
characteristic

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.725 align:middle line:84%
is this white dust that
you see on the leaves.

00:23:30.725 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And that white dust
is pure protein.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.598 align:middle line:84%
I never wash it off,
because it's pure protein.

00:23:37.598 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>How high does it grow?

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.735 align:middle line:84%
>>It goes everywhere
from here to here.

00:23:42.735 --> 00:23:45.210 align:middle line:90%
It has a very stocky stem.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Very fibrous.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like wood almost.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I never really use
the stem because it's

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:90%
a lot of insoluble fiber.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:90%
But it's got a very nice taste.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:84%
It kind of tastes
mild, like spinach.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Not too much of a
chlorophyll taste.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I just take the leaves,
and I throw them

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:90%
straight into a blender.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And it helps my body.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I love the taste of it.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
High in calcium, niacin, folate,
iron, magnesium, phosphorus,

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
vitamin A, C, K.
Great source of fiber.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:90%
How about this one?

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.915 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:18.415 align:middle line:90%
Clover.

00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:20.544 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.544 --> 00:24:22.085 align:middle line:84%
How many people can
recognize clover?

00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:23.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:90%
So clovers are edible.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if you can
help me identify them.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:90%
How many leaves?

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Three.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're really
lucky, then there's four.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
four leaf clovers

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
are more nutritious
than three leaf clovers?

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.444 align:middle line:90%
>>No.

00:24:37.444 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>Nah.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>25% more.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:90%
There's one extra leaf.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:90%
So clovers are blood purifiers.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:84%
They help to cleanse our blood
and fight cancer growths.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.899 align:middle line:90%
Any kind of cysts or tumors.

00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You can eat the stem, the
flower, and the leaves.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.939 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.939 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is so interesting.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:84%
This is stuff that
I would never know.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:90%
And also, you need to be safe.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.117 align:middle line:84%
So having an app, where you
can walk around in nature

00:25:02.117 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and look at those types
of things, is great.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Cautioning people, of course, to
be aware of various pesticides

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.545 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals on the
edibles-- on the wild edibles.

00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:11.211 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:14.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to be very
safe and cautious

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and know what
you're looking for.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's OK.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:90%
There is danger in anything.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Walking on the street
could be dangerous.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So just don't do anything
stupid, and you'll be fine.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, now, what is
one of the most nutritious

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.885 align:middle line:90%
wild edibles available?

00:25:29.885 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you able to pinpoint?

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's
not such a thing.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:90%
We always go for variety.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Because all greens in the world
have minute amount of alkaloids

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.410 align:middle line:90%
that accumulate in our body.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
have a variety.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the way of plants
to prevent overeating

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:90%
of some plant in extinction.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if that
will not be there,

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
then the deer will come
and eat the entire lilac

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.315 align:middle line:90%
in your backyard.

00:25:53.315 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that why--

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%

You'll begin to feel like

We're talking about the greens.

There's a round leaf green
wild edible called plantain.

>>BOUTENKO: Leafy greens usually
source of insoluble fiber.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.990 align:middle line:84%

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: That's
why I combine.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:90%
And also for the flavor.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.466 align:middle line:90%
For the taste.

00:27:44.466 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything--

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.121 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: I personally don't.

00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recommend,
because if you

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
put too much of a good
stuff, it's too good.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
It becomes overwhelming
for the body.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:84%
It slows down the
absorption of nutrients

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:90%
that are already there.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You could
do it separately,

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.000 align:middle line:90%
but I don't see the need.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.342 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel the need for it.

00:28:07.342 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about

fatty acids if you're
deficient in them.

00:28:17.809 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:84%
However, anything you
add to green smoothie

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
will slow down
absorption of nutrients.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.031 align:middle line:84%
If you want it to
be slowed down.

00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what the
green smoothie provide

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:84%
is as many of the vitamins
and nutrients that you need.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.016 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:28:29.016 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:84%
The greens have
so many vitamins.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, did you know that
the greens of carrots or greens

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:36.790 align:middle line:84%
of beets have 190
times more Vitamin

A than the carrot itself?

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.215 align:middle line:84%
And greens have 20 times

00:28:42.215 --> 00:28:43.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And greens have 2000 times
more vitamin K than anything

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.940 align:middle line:90%

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.064 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.165 align:middle line:90%

>>BOUTENKO: --restrooms.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I would just make

And a to-go Vitamix.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.860 align:middle line:90%
I've not heard of that before.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.943 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of different

>>BOUTENKO: And I have
small, portable blenders,

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
like Silver Bullet and Tribest
that I take overseas when I go.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.552 align:middle line:84%
I just don't travel
without blender.

00:31:24.552 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is actually
a very good tip.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.259 align:middle line:84%
To travel with a Silver
Bullet is a great idea.

00:31:28.259 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a type of a blender.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of different
ones that are available.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They've become very
available these days.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.408 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:31:34.408 --> 00:31:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I came here

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I froze two quarts of green

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning, I

>>LISA: You checked it in?

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah, because
in the air, it's cold.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.790 align:middle line:90%
So they're thawed.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:90%


00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.764 align:middle line:84%

00:31:54.764 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And I had
my fresh green smoothie.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh my gosh,
that's what you

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:90%
had this morning at the hotel.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Yesterday and today.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:02.230 align:middle line:90%
That is great to know.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So you make it--
I mean, I love how

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.490 align:middle line:84%
you make everything so
practical and so easy.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Because this would be something
that most people would

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.230 align:middle line:90%
think, oh, god, I can't do this.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.250 align:middle line:90%
It's too involved.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I need to follow
a specific recipe.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:84%
You say you rarely
ever follow recipes.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: I don't.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's been seven
years since I've

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.811 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: That's great.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:23.210 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.807 align:middle line:90%
So let's see.

00:32:23.807 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
What's in this that

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Oregano.

>>LISA: Oregano.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.061 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: And Rosemary.

00:32:30.061 --> 00:32:32.545 align:middle line:84%
And dandelion is the
king of everything.

00:32:32.545 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: King of everything.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:34.619 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Dandelions
are very nutritious.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:84%
They are richest in calcium
in the world, dandelions.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, they have
lots of micronutrients

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that are healing, even
for things like diabetes.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.380 align:middle line:90%


00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever tried to pull
a dandelion on your lawn?

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:53.222 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:53.222 --> 00:32:54.180 align:middle line:90%
They have that little--

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Is it possible?

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.842 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:32:54.842 --> 00:32:55.820 align:middle line:84%
They're very
strong, aren't they?

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: They
have long roots.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
water your grass,

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:00.736 align:middle line:84%
the grass will go
yellow, but dandelions

00:33:00.736 --> 00:33:03.105 align:middle line:84%
will stay brown-- I
mean, will stay green.

00:33:03.105 --> 00:33:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Will stay green.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because they
have very long roots.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:06.964 align:middle line:84%
And because they
have long roots,

00:33:06.964 --> 00:33:09.030 align:middle line:84%
they have all these
nutrients in them.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.487 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, they have the
little white sap inside of them

00:33:12.487 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:90%
usually, don't they?

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.727 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So
that's just juice.

00:33:14.727 --> 00:33:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it juice?

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Are there certain nutrients
that are contained

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.127 align:middle line:84%
in the white sappy
part of the dandelion?

00:33:20.127 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It's probably.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:84%
We won't ever know
everything about nutrition.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.787 align:middle line:90%
We keep learning more and more.

00:33:25.787 --> 00:33:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: New nutrients.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't actually use the stems.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:30.997 align:middle line:90%
I only use the flowers.

00:33:30.997 --> 00:33:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The flowers.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.871 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: That are going
to be thrown in there.

00:33:33.871 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But I always want
to start with water,

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.000 align:middle line:90%
so we see how much water we put.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.075 align:middle line:90%
Usually about two cups.

00:33:39.075 --> 00:33:41.070 align:middle line:90%


00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.970 align:middle line:90%
So this much.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:90%
And then I want to put greens.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And today I'm going
to use dandelions.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.310 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:90%
It's one of my favorite.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to just cut.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.249 align:middle line:84%
These are dandelions
from your backyard.

00:33:55.249 --> 00:33:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The garden.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:90%

Yes.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I just take the green
part and throw it in there.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And this we can
discard into compost.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And also I'm going to
take most of these flowers

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.275 align:middle line:90%
and I leave some for decoration.

00:34:10.275 --> 00:34:12.694 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.694 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So putting the
flowers right in there.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.276 align:middle line:90%

00:34:15.276 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Flowers smell good.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.004 align:middle line:90%

00:34:20.004 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.070 align:middle line:90%
This we discard.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:90%
And then oregano.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like
to put the stems,

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.900 align:middle line:84%
because they are
just mostly wood.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.250 align:middle line:90%
So I just put this.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it doesn't-- the stem
itself is a little too fiberous

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.517 align:middle line:90%
for the Vitamix?

00:34:33.517 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Exactly.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, they
are pretty tough.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:90%
So taking that off.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you
were to put it in,

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.340 align:middle line:84%
does it add or take
away any type of fiber

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.549 align:middle line:90%
that you would need?

00:34:43.549 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It will take
fiber, but it will be chewy.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.400 align:middle line:84%
You'll be finding it
in between your teeth.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.389 align:middle line:90%
It's not very nice.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to put too much
of it, because when we blend,

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.280 align:middle line:90%
the flavor will be brought up.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, what properties
in the oregano help the tummy?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.180 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Oregano has
certain antioxidants

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that destroy all
pathogenic bacteria.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.160 align:middle line:90%

>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.712 align:middle line:90%
It's a medicinal herb.

00:35:19.712 --> 00:35:20.795 align:middle line:90%

And the rosemary is also very
similar, but has different.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:30.931 align:middle line:84%
It has some ether, some oils

>>BOUTENKO: --avocado pit here.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't do it very often,

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:84%
a little bit bitter and I
kind of get tired of it.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:90%
But it does have potassium.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And also it has a good source
of soluble fiber in it.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.039 align:middle line:84%
So I'll show you how to blend
avocado pit in the blender.

00:35:56.039 --> 00:35:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: You can only do
it in a high speed blender.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.940 align:middle line:84%
If you have a just simple
blender, cheap blender,

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.970 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't work.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And in order to get it in
half-- I want to put only half

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:90%
of the pit.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I have to do it straight
from the beginning.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I cannot open it first, and
then try to cut the pit.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're
going to cut right--

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: I'll cut myself.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --through the pit here.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So I
just do it together

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.360 align:middle line:84%
with this, because
it's very soft.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.065 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:36:20.065 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's beautiful.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:21.675 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:21.675 --> 00:36:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: OK.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.924 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's the
inside of an avocado pit.

00:36:24.924 --> 00:36:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:26.461 align:middle line:90%


00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:27.835 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
put it in here.

00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:30.700 align:middle line:90%


00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to scoop the
avocado in there, too.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Now the avocado has
an amazing amount

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.180 align:middle line:90%
of essential fatty acids.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It has protein.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.240 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
complete food, isn't it?

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.615 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Avocado
is very good.

00:36:44.615 --> 00:36:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It does even have vitamin
K and chlorophyll in it.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And it has vitamin E, and it
has both omega 3 and omega 6.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:56.355 align:middle line:84%
Has more omega 6s, but
in a ratio like 1:6.

00:36:56.355 --> 00:36:59.160 align:middle line:84%
There's six times more
omega 6s than omega 3s.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.844 align:middle line:84%
But it's natural for
humans, so it's OK.

00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I've heard that
this is a complete food.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:90%
This is a super food.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It has all the elements,
in terms of protein,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:84%
essential fatty acids, vitamins,
in one complete food, right?

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I think it
depends on the person.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
necessarily that it

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.210 align:middle line:90%
is complete food for everybody.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:90%
For some people, maybe.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.274 align:middle line:84%
But it contains
more elements than--

00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:24.595 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --a regular--

00:37:24.595 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's a
very valuable food.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.550 align:middle line:84%
A very valuable,
nutritious food.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.475 align:middle line:84%
And I personally consume
avocados regularly.

00:37:30.475 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:31.766 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:37:31.766 --> 00:37:33.966 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: About how many
avocados a day do you eat?

00:37:33.966 --> 00:37:34.667 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: One.

00:37:34.667 --> 00:37:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: One avocado a day.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Not more?

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat more.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because?

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It's just enough.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's enough.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I used to be able
to eat five avocados a day

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.630 align:middle line:84%
sometime ago, maybe
five years ago.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.213 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I know
that you can also

00:37:49.213 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:90%
use them for your face.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of different
uses that you could--

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And contrary to popular belief,
dogs could eat avocados.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And even-- you find lots of
sources online that dogs cannot

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:90%
eat avocados.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with it.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's true.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I've seen wild dogs and
coyotes and other kinds

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.050 align:middle line:90%
of dogs and foxes each avocados.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:10.080 align:middle line:90%


00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Especially in San Diego,
where avocados grow plentiful,

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.040 align:middle line:84%
you'll find coyotes
right in avocados.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had a dog and my friend
had a dog and my son had a dog,

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and all of these dogs just
loved avocados and their fur

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:90%
gets good.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.577 align:middle line:84%
And there's now even a
company called AvoDerm.

00:38:25.577 --> 00:38:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.197 align:middle line:90%
I use that for our cats.

00:38:27.197 --> 00:38:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And so
this is a confusion

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:84%
brought by some
erroneous research.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:32.840 align:middle line:90%
So anyways--

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.879 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, if the dog will
eat the avocado, though.

00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't
like that consistency.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.878 align:middle line:90%
But it depends on the region.

00:38:39.878 --> 00:38:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So if it wouldn't
have rosemary and oregano,

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.585 align:middle line:84%
that would be also
a pet smoothie.

00:38:44.585 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, a pet smoothie.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:46.209 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:46.209 --> 00:38:49.299 align:middle line:84%
So you make green smoothies
for your pets all the time?

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: All the time.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rather than dog food?

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I don't ever
give dog food for my dog.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.449 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can't
imagine that you would.

00:38:56.449 --> 00:38:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So we just
put the whole thing.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.190 align:middle line:84%
We'll just leave a little
piece for decoration for later.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So oregano.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.954 align:middle line:84%
We have rosemary,
avocado, cucumber.

00:39:04.954 --> 00:39:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's
very simple, yes.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to
use lemon, but we

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.989 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure that
the seeds are out.

00:39:09.989 --> 00:39:11.863 align:middle line:84%
Because if I leave the
seeds, they're edible,

00:39:11.863 --> 00:39:13.180 align:middle line:90%
but they will make it bitter.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:13.864 align:middle line:90%
Very bitter.

00:39:13.864 --> 00:39:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So specifically
leaving the seeds out.

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.696 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:39:16.696 --> 00:39:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now-- wow,
we got sprayed.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.600 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the-- when you
said that the avocado pit has

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:84%
the soluble fiber in it, are
you not getting enough fiber

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.570 align:middle line:84%
from the vegetables and
the leaves themselves?

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:28.794 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.794 --> 00:39:29.710 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.085 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The
indigenous people

00:39:31.085 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:84%
get up to 150 grams of fiber,
according to my research,

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're supposed to get
30 grams of fiber per day,

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.020 align:middle line:90%
according to USDA.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But most people get, on average,
statistically, 10 to 12.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.946 align:middle line:90%
And many people have 3.

00:39:44.946 --> 00:39:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which would explain
a lot of colon disease.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And without
fiber, we cannot really detox.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.357 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because fiber
takes all the toxins out.

00:39:54.357 --> 00:39:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it cleanses the body.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.677 align:middle line:84%
And it also eliminates, yes, as
you said, a lot of the toxins.

00:39:58.677 --> 00:40:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So-- and lots
of food have zero fiber.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:84%
For example, all animal
products have zero fiber.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.010 align:middle line:90%
All white flour has zero fiber.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:90%
The white bread has zero fiber.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:10.472 align:middle line:84%
And so actually, the source of
fiber is fruits and vegetables.

00:40:10.472 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel that you
don't have enough fiber, why

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:84%
don't you just,
once in a while, put

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.370 align:middle line:84%
half of avocado pit in your
smoothie, in your soup,

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.104 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy more fiber.

00:40:20.104 --> 00:40:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great idea.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know, actually,
that you could blend them.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But you have to have
a high-speed blender.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.994 align:middle line:84%
Is there various speeds
within a Vitamix?

00:40:27.994 --> 00:40:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's a low speed
and a high speed?

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.368 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:40:30.368 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Low and high.

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Usually I use just two.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't very often
use the variable speed

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:36.590 align:middle line:90%
except for specific recipes.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.860 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.946 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
make some noise.

00:40:39.946 --> 00:40:40.227 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.227 --> 00:40:41.685 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So you
close your ears.

00:40:41.685 --> 00:40:51.900 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.332 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So this is the soup.

00:40:53.332 --> 00:40:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And the friction itself
makes it a little bit warmer.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Warmer.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a piece of cucumber
I see stuck here,

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.540 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going to stop and
put it on high and start again.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.462 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, that
looks so beautiful.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.845 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.845 --> 00:41:09.819 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:41:09.819 --> 00:41:11.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.254 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:41:12.254 --> 00:41:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And for how long?

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.154 align:middle line:84%
For how long do
you blend it for?

00:41:20.154 --> 00:41:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Usually I
blend it for 30 seconds.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I have
avocado pit there,

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make sure
it goes a little longer.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.151 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:27.441 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: So we're going to--

00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:28.942 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, this is great!

00:41:28.942 --> 00:41:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: --have this.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We get to try this.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.320 align:middle line:90%
You have to try this at home.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It is
very delicious soup.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And the key ingredients
are avocado and lemon juice

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:37.960 align:middle line:90%
and some spice.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.184 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it took us
under-- around 10 minutes

00:41:40.184 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:90%
to make something like this.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And we have
some for cameraman, too.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:43.734 align:middle line:90%


00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Everyone in the studio
get to eat when we do this.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.070 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you use this for
the-- oh, how beautiful.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.130 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the things
I love about fresh,

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:84%
green foods is that
you can make them

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.370 align:middle line:84%
so beautiful in
just a few minutes

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and bring out all the health
and vitality and the vitamins

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.155 align:middle line:90%
just by the presentation.

00:42:03.155 --> 00:42:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's
not really a soup

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.910 align:middle line:84%
until you put something
to float in it.

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.665 align:middle line:84%
So I like to put some
additional ingredients, whatever

00:42:10.665 --> 00:42:11.290 align:middle line:90%
I have on hand.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.277 align:middle line:84%
Could be grated
carrots or beets.

00:42:13.277 --> 00:42:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that for the texture?

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:15.776 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: For the texture.

00:42:15.776 --> 00:42:16.197 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.197 --> 00:42:17.530 align:middle line:90%
So you have something to crunch.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And I like something
bright, because I eat also

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:90%
by the color.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why do you do that?

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because
to make it pretty.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.394 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To make
it pretty, but do

00:42:25.394 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:90%
they have different nutrients?

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Of course it does.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Per color?

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.360 align:middle line:90%
It's rich in sodium.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And we all lack natural sodium.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.301 align:middle line:84%
And table salt doesn't
provide natural sodium.

00:42:34.301 --> 00:42:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there is definitely
a need for that.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.131 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you ever
use salts or pepper?

00:42:41.131 --> 00:42:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I don't
have salt in my house.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe any
salt is good for us.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So sea salt, Himalayan
salt, rock salt, nothing?

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I know some
people use salt, but I don't.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.722 align:middle line:84%
And no need for it, because
it comes from the vegetables?

00:42:53.722 --> 00:42:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: I think so.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.210 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, you are right.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.420 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is gorgeous.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Can you see this?

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.440 align:middle line:90%
So beautiful.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.331 align:middle line:90%
Now I want to eat it.

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:03.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I do have to try this,
because it is-- mmm.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:11.780 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.871 align:middle line:90%
It's so good.

00:43:13.871 --> 00:43:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: It's creamy.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.825 align:middle line:90%
It's tasty.

00:43:15.825 --> 00:43:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it tastes so fresh.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.917 align:middle line:90%
It really tastes so fresh.

00:43:18.917 --> 00:43:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And it's
filling and satisfying.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The oregano--
you can really

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.440 align:middle line:84%
taste the oregano and the
rosemary specifically,

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.922 align:middle line:84%
but in with the cucumber,
it softens the taste.

00:43:27.922 --> 00:43:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it like something
you could pretty much drink.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.900 align:middle line:84%
You could probably
drink it as well.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:32.440 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.940 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're
going to take a look

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.950 align:middle line:84%
at making something
else that's good in case

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.350 align:middle line:90%
you happen to get a cold.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:39.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
make a Cold Buster

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:41.140 align:middle line:90%
smoothie when we come back.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:58.130 align:middle line:90%


00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.376 align:middle line:84%
So if you happen to
be feeling like you're

00:44:00.376 --> 00:44:02.250 align:middle line:84%
catching a cold, if
you're under the weather,

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.890 align:middle line:84%
if you've got
symptoms of a cold,

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:08.160 align:middle line:84%
why reach for something that's
over-the-counter medication

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.300 align:middle line:84%
when you can get it from
nature as nature intended it?

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So we have put together--
or, actually, Victoria

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.880 align:middle line:84%
has put together--
an amazing recipe

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.500 align:middle line:84%
for you called a
Spinach Cold Buster.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.680 align:middle line:90%
So tell us what's in it.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.513 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you've got
the beautiful spinach.

00:44:21.513 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:84%
What properties in spinach help
with the symptoms of a cold?

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Spinach is high
in chlorophyll, in vitamin K,

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's alkalizing.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's a green you can
find at any store anywhere.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:36.649 align:middle line:84%
And it's mellow in taste,
and it's rich in calcium,

00:44:36.649 --> 00:44:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and it's just super rich.

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.540 align:middle line:90%
It's rich even in protein.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now,
chlorophyll is-- all

00:44:40.915 --> 00:44:42.289 align:middle line:84%
of these are high
in chlorophyll.

00:44:42.289 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:84%
What is the benefit of
chlorophyll in the body?

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Chlorophyll
is liquefied sunshine.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:90%
And sunshine, we always need.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:84%
There's never too much
light coming out of us.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we ingest
liquid sunshine

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.089 align:middle line:84%
in the form of chlorophyll,
we emanate light.

00:44:59.089 --> 00:45:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:00.713 align:middle line:90%
Emanate light.

00:45:00.713 --> 00:45:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And the
garlic is really

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.910 align:middle line:84%
detoxing and
antiviral, antifungus.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And why don't you
prepare me 12 cloves?

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And don't peel them, because
we have a high speed blender,

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.670 align:middle line:84%
so we can put them
with the peel.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You put
the peels right--

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Just separate 12.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You put the
peels right in the-- OK.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: For the recipe.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Good to know.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And I'm also going
to add both cayenne pepper

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and jalapeno, because both
peppers, they increase

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.570 align:middle line:84%
circulation of blood and
lymph and they detox.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.340 align:middle line:84%
They help with the lymphatic
drainage in the body.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the cayenne
is great for circulation.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And the jalapeno, they
have the same properties?

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes,
which is excellent

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:37.550 align:middle line:84%
if you get in touch
with anybody who

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:40.782 align:middle line:84%
has fever, flu,
that's really helpful.

00:45:40.782 --> 00:45:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
great for teachers.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put the whole
entire lemon in there

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.547 align:middle line:90%
for vitamin C.

00:45:45.547 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The rind and everything?

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.562 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No.

00:45:47.562 --> 00:45:48.520 align:middle line:90%
The juice of one lemon.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The juice of a lemon.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:49.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:49.969 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.969 --> 00:45:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So I'm just
going to start with that.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the cucumber
itself is, you said--

00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's one of the
most alkalizing vegetables that

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.420 align:middle line:90%
exist in the world, cucumber.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Cucumber-- actually lemon
also is very alkalizing,

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:05.920 align:middle line:90%
which is very good.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
take the seeds out.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.890 align:middle line:84%
They're edible,
but they will be so

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:11.710 align:middle line:84%
bitter nobody will
be able to enjoy it.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So we want
to take the seeds out.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you use a little juicer,
then it will eliminate that.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.790 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Now I'll just
squeeze it in the blender.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And then we'll
throw garlic in there.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.230 align:middle line:90%
All the cloves.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you take all
of the cloves of garlic.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:26.736 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:46:26.736 --> 00:46:29.324 align:middle line:84%
Put them in the
blender with the peel.

00:46:29.324 --> 00:46:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: With the peel.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, the peel adds what?

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.358 align:middle line:90%
What does the peel add?

00:46:32.358 --> 00:46:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It adds
insoluble fiber.

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: There's
soluble and insoluble.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Soluble is like banana.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like gel.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.495 align:middle line:84%
It helps to form the
stool and helps eliminate.

00:46:42.495 --> 00:46:45.050 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Insoluble fiber helps
to grab some toxins

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in the toxic waste
in our intestines.

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Now this, of course, is
also great for allergies.

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:56.349 align:middle line:84%
For seasonal allergies
as well as cold and flu?

00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: What, garlic?

00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The whole entire--
yeah, garlic and the smoothie.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.793 align:middle line:84%
Of course, because it
increases elimination.

00:47:01.793 --> 00:47:04.347 align:middle line:90%
It speeds up your metabolism.

00:47:04.347 --> 00:47:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So everything
here, basically,

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:10.060 align:middle line:84%
works as a detoxifier, builds
back up the immune system,

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.644 align:middle line:90%
and increases circulation.

00:47:11.644 --> 00:47:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's the idea that
you want behind it.

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, you can--

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: I want to blend
it in a small amount of water

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.108 align:middle line:84%
first, because I really
want to make sure

00:47:20.108 --> 00:47:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that all of this garlic
cloves are blended well,

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.259 align:middle line:90%
including their peels.

00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So we'll do this first.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Let's
make some noise.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.219 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:47:27.219 --> 00:47:39.187 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.187 --> 00:47:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: That's enough.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That looks like milk.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.231 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: About 10 seconds.

00:47:43.231 --> 00:47:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would not mistake
it for milk, though.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.540 align:middle line:90%
I have to smell it.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Mmm, yeah.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.411 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Smells like health.

00:47:48.411 --> 00:47:48.962 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:47:48.962 --> 00:47:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And then
we'll add some more water.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.980 align:middle line:90%


00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So why did you do
it in stages like that?

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because I wanted to
have more friction in a smaller

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.414 align:middle line:84%
amount of water to really
blend well the garlic.

00:48:01.414 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Break up the garlic.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And I've
heard-- once I was traveling

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.570 align:middle line:84%
in Siberia, and one shaman
told me that sometimes

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:13.374 align:middle line:84%
in the winter, they just eat
the whole bulb of garlic as--

00:48:13.374 --> 00:48:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like an apple?

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: --against parasites.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Like an apple, yeah.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.220 align:middle line:84%
They'll just peel it, of course,
and they'll just eat it alone.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For anti-- its
antiparasite quality?

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.395 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:48:24.395 --> 00:48:26.623 align:middle line:84%
Antiparasites,
antifungal, antibacterial.

00:48:26.623 --> 00:48:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Garlic is an amazing--

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And some people
say we shouldn't eat no spices.

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:33.440 align:middle line:90%
No garlic and no onions.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And I read this in
Ayurvedic teachings,

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was following for
several years, not eating.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But then I read in
research of Jane Goodall

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:45.190 align:middle line:84%
about chimpanzees,
that sometimes

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in the wilderness,
Lisa, they would--

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:84%
the students would follow
herd of chimpanzees,

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.110 align:middle line:84%
the family of chimpanzees, and
they would pick up the stool

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and pick up the
samples of their food.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And they noticed that whenever
they developed parasites

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.610 align:middle line:84%
in the stool, they begin to
eat wild garlic and wild onion

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and spicy leaves
and spicy fruits.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So that gave me an
idea that it's totally,

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.170 align:middle line:90%
completely is intuitive.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So if I crave garlic
or, say, jalapeno,

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:16.900 align:middle line:84%
or hot foods or chives,
I would go for it.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But then suddenly I would
stop, and I don't want it.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.826 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because your
body is telling you

00:49:20.826 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:84%
it needs to get
rid of parasites.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:23.074 align:middle line:90%
And then you--

00:49:23.074 --> 00:49:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Who knows.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Parasites, maybe something else.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.966 align:middle line:84%
We don't know everything
about our body.

00:49:26.966 --> 00:49:28.774 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
what the body is.

00:49:28.774 --> 00:49:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, the body has an
amazing, innate intelligence

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:32.160 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Because how old are
you, and how old is your body?

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:38.396 align:middle line:84%
Your body is thousands
of years old of wisdom.

00:49:38.396 --> 00:49:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is true.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:43.224 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So I trust--
I choose to trust my body.

00:49:43.224 --> 00:49:44.765 align:middle line:84%
So let's put the
rest of ingredients.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even have

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The jalapeno?

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: I'm just going to--

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Put the

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The
whole thing in, yes.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.119 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And did
we put already--

00:49:53.119 --> 00:49:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This'll get

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.935 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:49:55.935 --> 00:49:56.770 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And seeds
of the jalapeno also.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now, this will
help take some of the fire

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:04.870 align:middle line:90%
out, right?

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:05.620 align:middle line:90%
The cucumber will.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.286 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:50:06.286 --> 00:50:07.770 align:middle line:90%
You can just chop it coarsely.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:10.280 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, it doesn't
matter how thick

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.450 align:middle line:90%
you cut the cucumber, right?

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:15.283 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, if you
have a good blender.

00:50:15.283 --> 00:50:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:16.440 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:16.939 align:middle line:90%
And so now--

00:50:16.939 --> 00:50:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The
whole thing goes in,

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.880 align:middle line:84%
because we don't need to
leave any for decoration now.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.180 align:middle line:90%
So just whole thing goes in.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The whole cucumber.

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would think
you need to balance that

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.150 align:middle line:90%
out a little bit.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And we shouldn't
forget the cayenne pepper.

Get that circulation moving.

00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So now-- and the cayenne,
of course, again,

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is good for the lymph
nodes, for circulation.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:37.140 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.379 align:middle line:84%

And this time, we're not

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to

I actually do know that you have
a way of taking this pit out

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.960 align:middle line:90%
of here, I saw it demonstrated--

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So just
go ahead and try it.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --by your daughter.

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.332 align:middle line:84%
If I do this right--
just cut it like this?

00:51:16.332 --> 00:51:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.270 align:middle line:90%
And just twist it.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, you twist it.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:21.422 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:51:21.422 --> 00:51:23.256 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: So you
learn by doing.

00:51:23.256 --> 00:51:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I watched that
on one of your videos.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.372 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Oh, good.

00:51:26.372 --> 00:51:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So now, why do you
use the avocado?

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.440 align:middle line:90%


00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Avocado
has soluble fiber,

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.810 align:middle line:84%
so that will help to
keep the smoothie silky.

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And it will prevent
it from separation.

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:42.300 align:middle line:84%
If I don't use avocado, then
it will separate in one minute.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.190 align:middle line:84%
It will be foam on top and
lots of liquid underneath.

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:47.944 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So avocado is
essentially a fruit, right?

00:51:47.944 --> 00:51:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And it has soluble fiber in
it, so that will make sure that

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:55.990 align:middle line:84%
it'll be-- consistency will
be thorough throughout the--

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:58.473 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we are actually
adding a fruit to this smoothie

00:51:58.473 --> 00:51:58.973 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:51:58.973 --> 00:52:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And also, it
will mellow the spice in.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.410 align:middle line:84%
The spice will still
go in the body,

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:06.250 align:middle line:84%
but it will be easier to
consume because of avocado.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:07.710 align:middle line:90%
It makes it easier.

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, this much spice
wouldn't hurt the tummy at all?

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.690 align:middle line:90%


00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: No.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:14.979 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No?

00:52:14.979 --> 00:52:16.140 align:middle line:90%


00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.450 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at me
like it's a foreign--

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:20.560 align:middle line:84%
my tummy is very
sensitive to spice.

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: The
human body is really

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.050 align:middle line:84%
made to be consuming
different things.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we're looking at
that spice and smelling it,

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:33.040 align:middle line:84%
our body's capable of creating
a preventative layer of mucus

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.044 align:middle line:90%
that will not let it be hurt.

00:52:35.044 --> 00:52:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just by smelling it?

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.246 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:52:37.246 --> 00:52:40.087 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And then
this is the best lotion.

00:52:40.087 --> 00:52:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: The avocado.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Don't wash
it off of your hands.

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't ever.

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:44.424 align:middle line:90%
Don't waste it.

00:52:44.424 --> 00:52:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great idea.

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Save
money on lotions.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Put it in your hair.

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:47.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Well, and then
you have to go take a shower.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.170 align:middle line:90%


00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:54.670 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be great.

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: And see,
some of the greens

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:58.330 align:middle line:84%
are actually getting
into the lid,

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.330 align:middle line:84%
so I'll just do a little
bit and then go again.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Back to our
power tool segment here.

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:06.338 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yeah.

00:53:06.338 --> 00:53:07.845 align:middle line:90%
And now I can push it down.

00:53:07.845 --> 00:53:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.020 align:middle line:90%
So 30 seconds.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:22.332 align:middle line:90%


00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Shouldn't
take the lid off.

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:24.786 align:middle line:90%
It'll go everywhere.

00:53:24.786 --> 00:53:38.976 align:middle line:90%


00:53:38.976 --> 00:53:39.726 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna turn it.

00:53:39.726 --> 00:53:42.585 align:middle line:90%


00:53:42.585 --> 00:53:43.710 align:middle line:90%
You know what you're doing.

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:48.230 align:middle line:90%


00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:49.660 align:middle line:84%
We've made enough
for you at home,

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.005 align:middle line:90%
so this'll work out perfectly.

00:53:51.005 --> 00:53:52.370 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:53.080 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.500 align:middle line:90%


00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.592 align:middle line:84%
So you had a different
technique that you used there,

00:53:57.592 --> 00:53:58.300 align:middle line:90%
with the blender.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.383 align:middle line:84%
You turn it off, and then
you can turn it back on.

00:54:00.383 --> 00:54:03.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't actually need to use
anything-- a spoon or anything.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: Sometimes
I use a tamper

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.120 align:middle line:84%
when I prefer to have less
liquid in it-- in the blender.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.460 align:middle line:84%
If I make puddings without
water, then I use this.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Or if something's stuck.

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:16.366 align:middle line:84%
But this time, I just turn it
off and turn it on quickly.

00:54:16.366 --> 00:54:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now the water, it
doesn't dilute the enzymes,

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:19.010 align:middle line:90%
does it?

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.885 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Smell it.

00:54:19.885 --> 00:54:20.916 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.916 --> 00:54:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ooh, you know what?

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:84%
That-- you can't really
smell the garlic at all.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.209 align:middle line:84%
You can smell
mostly the cucumber.

00:54:26.209 --> 00:54:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes, and the lemon.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.416 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And the lemon.

00:54:28.416 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:31.921 align:middle line:84%
I want you all to
try this at home,

00:54:31.921 --> 00:54:33.920 align:middle line:84%
because this is-- even
if you don't have a cold,

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.990 align:middle line:90%
it's a great detoxifier.

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It's great for circulation.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:40.359 align:middle line:84%
Probably amazing for energy,
because both of those things

00:54:40.359 --> 00:54:42.150 align:middle line:84%
are going to, of course,
build your energy.

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.816 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Yes.

00:54:42.816 --> 00:54:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And you could also
add an apple to that

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to make it more palatable
if you want, as a variety.

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cheers.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BOUTENKO: Cheers.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cheers to you at home.

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Definitely try these
green smoothies at home.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.680 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, it takes
us about 10 minutes,

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.470 align:middle line:84%
or under 10 minutes,
to make these.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:57.910 align:middle line:90%
And I have to taste this.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:59.070 align:middle line:90%


00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Mmm.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.720 align:middle line:84%
That actually tastes
like a soup as well.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It is
actually very tasty.

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's really good.

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what it tastes like?

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Guacamole.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Guacamole in a glass.

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, that's really, really good.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BOUTENKO: It's a
liquid guacamole.

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Liquid guacamole.

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.957 align:middle line:90%
