>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:26.327 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to know
what God looks like?

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:29.396 align:middle line:84%
How about heaven, would you like
to know what heaven looks like?

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.998 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are not
the questions

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:34.635 align:middle line:84%
that Harvard train neurosurgeon
Dr. Eben Alexander was asking

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.303 align:middle line:90%
himself when a rare form

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:39.707 align:middle line:84%
of meningitis attacked his
brain causing him to go

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:42.376 align:middle line:90%
into a coma for seven days.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.211 align:middle line:84%
And what he found
there, he describes

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.181 align:middle line:90%
in his book as Proof of Heaven.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.884 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the show,
thank for being here.

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:50.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Eben Alexander:
Well, thank you Lisa,

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:52.052 align:middle line:90%
it's so good to be here.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa Garr: It gives me
chills to even say that opening,

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:57.525 align:middle line:84%
what you have been through,
and what you're here to share

00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:90%
with us is extraordinary.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So, let's start up talking a
little bit about your experience

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.666 align:middle line:84%
as a neurosurgeon,
as a man of science

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.303 align:middle line:84%
and all the research
that you did.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:13.174 align:middle line:84%
How does that come into play
with your experience now,

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:15.042 align:middle line:90%
being a man of science?

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Eben Alexander: Well, I
think the important thing

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.247 align:middle line:84%
to understand, I had grown
up in a scientific family.

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:84%
My father very much
is a scientist.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.019 align:middle line:84%
He was neurosurgeon, head
of a training program.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:26.854 align:middle line:84%
So, he trained other
neurosurgeons.

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:28.923 align:middle line:90%
He was also very spiritual.

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So, I had both those things
in my upbringing and went

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.765 align:middle line:84%
to a Methodist Church and I'm--
much my life wanted to believe

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:41.168 align:middle line:84%
in God, and heaven,
and power of prayer,

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:45.605 align:middle line:84%
but through a long career
in neurosurgery, you know,

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:49.476 align:middle line:84%
15 years at Harvard Medical
School, dealing with thousands

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.845 align:middle line:84%
of patients, many
of them had been

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.147 align:middle line:90%
in coma for various reasons.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.516 align:middle line:90%
I found it harder and harder

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:59.954 align:middle line:84%
to explain how consciousness
could survive death

00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:01.989 align:middle line:90%
of the body and brain.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:07.394 align:middle line:84%
And so, in fact when I went
into coma in 2008, I was driven

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:12.666 align:middle line:84%
into coma very rapidly within
a few hours by a severe case

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:16.003 align:middle line:84%
of bacterial meningitis that by
all right should have killed me.

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:17.404 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And what is
the percentage

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:19.607 align:middle line:90%
of people that it does kill?

00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:25.012 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, bacterial
meningitis is a 100 percent

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:27.114 align:middle line:90%
fail, if not treated.

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:30.551 align:middle line:84%
Even when treated rapidly
with the right antibiotics,

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:35.623 align:middle line:84%
most series it's still 30
to 40-- 50 percent fail.

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:39.593 align:middle line:84%
And in fact in my particular
case, given that I went

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:42.863 align:middle line:84%
into coma within about
3 and a half or 4 hours

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:43.831 align:middle line:90%
of unsettled symptoms.

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:44.665 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.433 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: That in itself when I got

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.835 align:middle line:84%
to the emergency
room I was found

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:51.437 align:middle line:84%
to have bacterial meningitis,
going into coma that quickly

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.842 align:middle line:84%
with bacterial meningitis
takes you to about a 10 percent

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:57.778 align:middle line:84%
or less survival
for that illness.

00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:00.381 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the week,
when I was not responding

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:03.183 align:middle line:84%
to antibiotics, that was down
to about a 2 or 3 percent chance

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.719 align:middle line:84%
of survival with no
chance of recovery.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.222 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What happens to the
brain when you have that type

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:10.157 align:middle line:90%
of a bacterial infection?

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, it actually
is the most perfect model

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.263 align:middle line:84%
of human death, because
that kind

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.166 align:middle line:84%
of bacterial infection
attacks the neocortex,

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
it attacks the entire
outer surface of the brain.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.206 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part that
absolutely crucial for all

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.342 align:middle line:90%
of our human consciousness.

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:32.079 align:middle line:84%
All the details of our
conscious awareness

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.883 align:middle line:84%
since before we were born,
everything we see, hear are kind

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:40.086 align:middle line:84%
of a logical, rational
thinking language, understanding

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:44.258 align:middle line:84%
of our surroundings and
of our body position

00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:46.994 align:middle line:84%
and space every bit
of that requires

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:50.331 align:middle line:84%
that complex calculator
of the neocortex.

00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:55.636 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, severe bacterial
meningitis was such a gift,

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
because it basically
attacked all of that

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.309 align:middle line:84%
and should have taken me
down to a level according

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.512 align:middle line:84%
to modern neuroscience where
I would have only the most

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:08.115 align:middle line:84%
rudimentary form
of consciousness

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:09.516 align:middle line:90%
which I describe in my book.

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.019 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
earthworm's eye view was

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.358 align:middle line:84%
that rudimentary course, kind
of unresponsive consciousness

00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:19.326 align:middle line:90%
that one could have when most

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:22.896 align:middle line:84%
of their neocortex has been
killed off by bacteria.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.199 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: The most simplest
form of consciousness,

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.001 align:middle line:84%
is that what you mean
very uncomplicated?

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.671 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, a very kind of
simplistic rudimentary form

00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:34.641 align:middle line:84%
of awareness that would be
completely non interactive,

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.678 align:middle line:84%
non aware, I mean in
that original state,

00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:40.147 align:middle line:90%
in that earthworm eye view--

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:41.882 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Earthworm eye view,
what do you mean by that?

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:44.418 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: That was-- that's
how I describe in my book

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:90%
that first realm that I was in--

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.588 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Which is basically
a very course underground

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.128 align:middle line:84%
where like being in dirty
jello and totally unresponsive.

00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:58.499 align:middle line:84%
People had often asked me
was that hell or purgatory?

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.135 align:middle line:84%
I would think hell would be at
least a little bit interactive

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:04.438 align:middle line:84%
and this was not at all
interactive even though

00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:10.277 align:middle line:84%
that meningitis that very simple
course consciousness involve no

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:14.982 align:middle line:84%
recollection whatsoever of my
life before, nothing at all

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:19.386 align:middle line:84%
of language, no knowledge of
earth, humans, absolutely zero

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:21.989 align:middle line:84%
about Eben Alexander, certainly
not any of my religions

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:90%
or any other kind of background.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.529 align:middle line:84%
All that was completely wiped
out which enabled my NDE

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.498 align:middle line:84%
to have some unusual
features that are a typical,

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.835 align:middle line:84%
and yet I look at them,
it's making it the exception

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.105 align:middle line:84%
that proves the rule,
that validates millions

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.274 align:middle line:90%
of other similar stories.

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:41.275 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have
a form and opinion

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.112 align:middle line:90%
of near death experiences before

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:47.281 align:middle line:84%
when you were practicing
as a neurosurgeon?

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.317 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have
an opinion of those?

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:51.685 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: I was-- before my coma,

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I was very much a card toadying
conventional neuroscientist.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
I believed completely in
what they called reductive

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.529 align:middle line:84%
materialist view of
the world that is

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.965 align:middle line:84%
if you can explain everything
in terms of electrons,

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:07.935 align:middle line:84%
corks [phonetic], protons,
neutrons, the physics,

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:11.638 align:middle line:84%
chemistry, biology that you
can then explain everything

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:13.407 align:middle line:90%
about all of the existence.

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:16.043 align:middle line:84%
The only problem with that
conventional science is I came

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.912 align:middle line:90%
to see it after my coma is

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:25.018 align:middle line:84%
that that conventional science
has not the most primitive

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:28.655 align:middle line:84%
explanation whatsoever for how
the physical brain might give

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:29.957 align:middle line:90%
rise to consciousness.

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:32.226 align:middle line:84%
And that's a tremendous
red flag.

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:33.293 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.862 align:middle line:84%
As you had said once
in your book

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:38.832 align:middle line:84%
that the body can actually
function without or is it

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:41.602 align:middle line:90%
without the use of the heart--

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:44.004 align:middle line:84%
the brain, is that
what you've said?

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:45.372 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Well, that the--

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:47.541 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: The death of the body
and the brain are not the end

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.275 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness you said.

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:49.676 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:53.046 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, in fact with my coma
journey showed me very clearly.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:55.815 align:middle line:84%
And this was that gift of
severe bacterial meningitis

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.084 align:middle line:90%
that should've killed me

00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:02.422 align:middle line:84%
or at least absolutely
limited my conscious experience

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.324 align:middle line:84%
to the most rudimentary
as opposed

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:08.061 align:middle line:84%
to the most incredible ultra
real vibrant journey life

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:12.299 align:middle line:84%
changing that I could ever
imagine which is what happened.

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.135 align:middle line:84%
And there was no place in
my brain for that to unfold.

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:19.773 align:middle line:84%
Before my coma, being that
conventional neuroscientist,

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:22.643 align:middle line:84%
I thought with the brain
creates consciousness.

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:25.345 align:middle line:84%
So, when the brain and
body die, that's the end

00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:90%
and that is absolutely false.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.382 align:middle line:90%
I've come to realize.

00:07:28.382 --> 00:07:31.517 align:middle line:84%
I never paid any attention to
the near death literature before

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:36.256 align:middle line:84%
because my physical is mind set,
it's set its all birth to death

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:38.025 align:middle line:84%
and the brain creates
consciousness--

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:38.859 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:39.993 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: I had absolutely no way

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:44.064 align:middle line:84%
to understand how those
phenomenon could occur.

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:49.236 align:middle line:84%
So, I was unwilling to look at
the data and come to understand

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:52.239 align:middle line:84%
that there are tens of
thousands of reports out there

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:54.508 align:middle line:84%
and the similarity is
far away the differences.

00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:55.809 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.611 align:middle line:84%
So, I have a question about
your book in the prologue.

00:07:57.611 --> 00:07:59.413 align:middle line:84%
Why did you make the
choice to tell us

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
about your incredible
sky diving experiences?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.986 align:middle line:90%
You were an avid sky diver.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:09.856 align:middle line:84%
You loved flying
since you're a child.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.391 align:middle line:90%
What is the correlation there?

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:14.728 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, I think
to me and looking back

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:18.532 align:middle line:84%
on it especially it became
clear that I was always trying

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:20.601 align:middle line:90%
to get up above this world.

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:25.105 align:middle line:84%
It's like I felt more at
home being up and above.

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:28.642 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, as
I tell my book I--

00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
when I was 14 years old I
soloed in sailplanes and to me--

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.415 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: 14.

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:38.986 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- at 14 and I was
just always wanting to be up,

00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:42.623 align:middle line:84%
whether if it's climbing trees
when I was a young kid or,

00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:47.361 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was pole vaulting
in high school, the sailplanes

00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:50.364 align:middle line:84%
at age 14, and the sky
diving all through college.

00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:55.102 align:middle line:84%
It was always about trying
to get into a higher realm

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:58.805 align:middle line:84%
and I think in a sense that
serves as kind of a metaphor

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:00.374 align:middle line:90%
for what I ended up doing--

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:01.475 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:03.143 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- in my big
journey, deep in coma.

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you're into the
wormhole experience of--

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.449 align:middle line:84%
I just called it a wormhole
you said-- you called it a--

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Earthworm's eye view.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.518 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Earthworm's eye view.

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So, then you enter to this
incredible blissful state.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.925 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:22.362 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, the--
that initial realm,

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:24.131 align:middle line:84%
as I said I had no
language and a word,

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:25.699 align:middle line:90%
no memory of my life before,

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:27.901 align:middle line:84%
that was that earthworm
eye view.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:32.372 align:middle line:84%
And that amnesia from my life
before was present throughout

00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:33.773 align:middle line:90%
this journey.

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:37.611 align:middle line:84%
It's very important because it
led this on atypical features

00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:41.114 align:middle line:84%
because many souls who go
into near death experience

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:46.219 align:middle line:84%
and comeback to talk about it
go in and have some knowing

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:50.724 align:middle line:84%
of an identity and of their
relationship with other souls.

00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:52.926 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
that in my journey

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.929 align:middle line:84%
and of course originally
I explained all this

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:59.166 align:middle line:84%
because of the severe
bacterial meningitis wiping

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.734 align:middle line:90%
out my neocortex.

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.703 align:middle line:84%
I now know their
far deeper reasons

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:04.971 align:middle line:84%
for why it all unfolded
the way it did.

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:09.976 align:middle line:84%
But that was the explanation
it was necessary at that time.

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:12.713 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
realm I was rescued

00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:16.883 align:middle line:84%
by the slowly spinning
pure white light

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:18.118 align:middle line:90%
that came towards me.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.388 align:middle line:84%
I remembered it looked
liked it had a surface kind

00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:25.225 align:middle line:84%
of a ground glass but it
was a very pure clear light

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:28.995 align:middle line:84%
where these fine white and gold
filaments coming off of it.

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:31.365 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Kind of ever
decent opalescent?

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:33.734 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: It was very
much an opalescent--

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:34.601 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:36.336 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: -- orb of light.

00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:42.242 align:middle line:84%
Very clear, very pure and it had
the most perfect musical melody.

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:46.313 align:middle line:84%
And it came towards me
very slowly spinning.

00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:48.849 align:middle line:84%
And as it did I was just
captivated by this light

00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:52.452 align:middle line:84%
and then it opened up
like a rip in the fabric

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:56.556 align:middle line:84%
of that gross earthworm
eye view realm and lit

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:59.826 align:middle line:90%
up into this brilliant valley

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:05.599 align:middle line:84%
into what I call the Gateway
Valley, the gateway realm.

00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And the vivid ultra real nature
of that valley is something

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.376 align:middle line:84%
that is so far beyond words,
I was moving up through it

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:20.514 align:middle line:84%
because I was a spec of
awareness, on a butterfly away.

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, you know,
the skeptics hear butterfly

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.219 align:middle line:84%
and they hear the rest of this
beautiful earth-like valley

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:28.188 align:middle line:90%
and they get a little mislead.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.323 align:middle line:84%
They start thinking, well,
this is just trappings

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:32.359 align:middle line:90%
of your brain before in kind

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:35.195 align:middle line:84%
of earth-like stop
that got layered on.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is some
of that for some people,

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.433 align:middle line:84%
for me that's a lot less
convincing because I had

00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:84%
such a complete destruction
of my neocortex that allowed

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.871 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of this to unfold.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.707 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you saw that through
the-- this-- the brain scans?

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.009 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Oh yeah.

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:50.677 align:middle line:84%
Through the brain scans and
neurologic exams, I mean,

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:54.481 align:middle line:84%
it was very clear that the
meningitis had severely attacked

00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:56.283 align:middle line:90%
my neocortex.

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:58.952 align:middle line:84%
And that's what was
causing the coma.

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.922 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I looked-- I also
knew all the drugs I was on,

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:04.991 align:middle line:84%
I knew the drug doses all
through the week correlated

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:08.528 align:middle line:84%
with the neurologic exams,
correlated with the scans.

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:11.598 align:middle line:84%
So, it was clear to me, I
went into coma, you know,

00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:14.034 align:middle line:90%
in my home-- in my bed at home.

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I had seizures and then was
comatose intermittently seizing

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.778 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe out of deep coma
but certainly not conscious

00:12:24.778 --> 00:12:28.582 align:middle line:84%
at all for the-- at first hour
to into the emergency room.

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:31.451 align:middle line:84%
And then my exams from
that point on showed

00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:33.753 align:middle line:84%
that my neurologic
function declined.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.957 align:middle line:84%
They did have me on sedatives
during some of that time.

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:39.226 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: But none of those
had psychotropic effects?

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:41.061 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, they could
have if I'd had much

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:43.296 align:middle line:90%
of a neocortex left to function.

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:48.134 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, by that time,
my neocortex was not working.

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:52.138 align:middle line:84%
And that was documented in the
neurologic exams that showed

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:55.475 align:middle line:84%
that happening and then
on scans on several days,

00:12:55.475 --> 00:13:00.947 align:middle line:84%
CT-scans showing that I had
swelling through both sides,

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.883 align:middle line:90%
hemispheres all eight lobes

00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:06.653 align:middle line:84%
and was even losing what's
called the gray-white junction

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:08.521 align:middle line:84%
at the depth-- the
deepest layers

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:12.325 align:middle line:84%
of a neocortex was
starting to melt away due

00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:13.627 align:middle line:90%
to the effect of the meningitis.

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:16.529 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: It is amazing you're
even sitting here talking

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:19.266 align:middle line:90%
like you are without any damage.

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:22.402 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: I think that's one of
the things that was so shocking.

00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:25.338 align:middle line:84%
And of course I didn't realize
at first how shocking that was.

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:26.473 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Because you [inaudible]--

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.807 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Because I had no
idea how sick I'd been.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:32.145 align:middle line:84%
And when I fist came back,
from coma, it's also important

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:36.148 align:middle line:84%
to point out that my brain
had been badly damaged.

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:36.816 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: My language--

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.585 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:39.953 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- was just beginning
to come back when I woke

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:44.291 align:middle line:84%
up on the 7th day and when they
took out the breathing tube.

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.326 align:middle line:90%
And so, language was coming back

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.662 align:middle line:84%
but I remembered
nothing of my life.

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:54.067 align:middle line:84%
And two of my sisters spent
nights in my ICU room with me.

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:57.103 align:middle line:84%
They would kind of relive
some of our family memories

00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:59.406 align:middle line:84%
of vacations, when we're
kids and things like that.

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:02.876 align:middle line:84%
They tell me stories that
initially to me were fascinating

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.377 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't part of them.

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:06.513 align:middle line:84%
But then slowly that
started triggering

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:07.714 align:middle line:90%
and bringing things back.

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:10.684 align:middle line:84%
So, over a few weeks, a
lot of my kind of family

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.052 align:middle line:84%
and childhood memories
came back.

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh, that was
nice of them.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.489 align:middle line:84%
I went though the same
experience where I--

00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:19.893 align:middle line:84%
I had a near death experience
and went to that beautiful place

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:22.729 align:middle line:84%
that I called Oneness but
out of it I lost my memory

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:24.297 align:middle line:90%
for good three months.

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:28.301 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, a lot of my
memories of life before

00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:34.741 align:middle line:84%
like knowledge of consciousness
of brain mind of physics,

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:38.778 align:middle line:84%
chemistry, all of that took up
to six weeks or so to come back.

00:14:38.778 --> 00:14:41.648 align:middle line:84%
So, that was very
important because I went--

00:14:41.648 --> 00:14:44.451 align:middle line:84%
when I first came back
within a few days,

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:46.453 align:middle line:84%
I knew every bit
of where I'd been.

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:47.988 align:middle line:90%
That story--

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:48.922 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That was--

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:50.123 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- was rich
as could be and

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:53.226 align:middle line:84%
yet I remembered nothing
of life before coma.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.829 align:middle line:90%
And so, while, and of course

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:58.231 align:middle line:84%
when I would tell my doctors
some of what I remembered,

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.733 align:middle line:84%
they would pat me
on the back and say,

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.035 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, you were very sick.

00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:05.939 align:middle line:84%
Your brain was so damaged
by this meningitis.

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:09.209 align:middle line:84%
There is no way you could have
had any experience like that.

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.877 align:middle line:90%
So, you can forget about it."

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:13.046 align:middle line:84%
You know, the dying brain
does all kinds of tricks.

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:14.247 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.648 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: I didn't know any
better so I believed them.

00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:17.851 align:middle line:84%
You know, most people believe
their doctors so I'd say, "OK,

00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:19.486 align:middle line:84%
a dying brain could
do any trick."

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But I gleaned enough from
that that to realize there had

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.526 align:middle line:84%
to be some kind of lesson
in there about consciousness

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:29.062 align:middle line:84%
because I knew what
I remembered.

00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:31.097 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered a
very vivid odyssey,

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:33.633 align:middle line:84%
if you'd ask me how long
I've been in that coma.

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:35.835 align:middle line:84%
I would have said at
least months maybe years.

00:15:35.835 --> 00:15:39.606 align:middle line:84%
It means a long very
extensive odyssey.

00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:43.109 align:middle line:84%
And so, I knew there had to be
some kind of lesson in there

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:46.112 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness because my
doctors were telling me nothing

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.114 align:middle line:84%
could have happened,
your brain was too sick.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:50.617 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Can you go back to this
spec on the butterfly wing

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:55.121 align:middle line:84%
that you were and that feeling
not even a feeling it was an

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:57.523 align:middle line:84%
experience that you
had of that brightness.

00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:03.563 align:middle line:84%
Did you experience a-- it was a
little girl that came in and--

00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:04.497 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Well.

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:05.665 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- her face
appeared, right?

00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:07.834 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Yeah, on this
butterfly wing when I went

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:12.872 align:middle line:84%
up into this beautiful valley
ultra real and the colors

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:15.141 align:middle line:84%
of the butterfly, and gain
this is not a butterfly

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:17.677 align:middle line:84%
like some entomologist on
earth could give you genus

00:16:17.677 --> 00:16:18.778 align:middle line:90%
and species.

00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:21.748 align:middle line:84%
It's simply the best
word I have to convey

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:24.918 align:middle line:84%
about what was my mode
of transportation.

00:16:24.918 --> 00:16:26.286 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:29.289 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: We move up into that
valley and there were millions

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:31.691 align:middle line:84%
of other butterflies
and they were flying

00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:35.829 align:middle line:84%
in this tremendous lovely
river of life and color

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.832 align:middle line:84%
and we would sweep down
into that lush greenery.

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:42.769 align:middle line:84%
And as we flew by, buds
on trees and blossoms

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:90%
on flowers would open up.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:45.772 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:48.675 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And these rich textures
and colors beyond the rainbow,

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:51.044 align:middle line:84%
waterfalls and the
sparkling pools--

00:16:51.044 --> 00:16:52.312 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:54.948 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- below us, souls
are dancing a lots of joy

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and mirth children
playing, dogs are jumping,

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:02.155 align:middle line:90%
incredible-- just idyllic scene.

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:03.656 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Is this what
you would describe

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:06.525 align:middle line:84%
as your best definition
of heaven?

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.394 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, it's
only a part of it

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:11.764 align:middle line:84%
because in fact there
were two main realms

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:15.335 align:middle line:84%
that I visited beyond
that earthworm eye view.

00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:17.803 align:middle line:84%
This first one, this
gateway realm,

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:22.142 align:middle line:84%
that beautiful idyllic valley
with the souls dancing,

00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:25.812 align:middle line:90%
souls between lives and that

00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:30.984 align:middle line:84%
on that butterfly
wing, a beautiful girl.

00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:33.953 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely gorgeous and
she never said a word

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:36.389 align:middle line:84%
and I can remember her face,
I can remember her clothing,

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.325 align:middle line:84%
every thing, how she was sitting
with her knees together off

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:42.862 align:middle line:84%
to the side and looking at
me with this lovely smile.

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:44.931 align:middle line:90%
This look of pure love.

00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:46.399 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Was she younger?

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.067 align:middle line:90%
Was she older?

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:51.271 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: She looked to
be kind of, I mean,

00:17:51.271 --> 00:17:52.906 align:middle line:90%
it's so hard to put in age.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: In age, yes.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.942 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: But I would say
kind of a perfect age.

00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:58.578 align:middle line:84%
You know, she was in
her early or mid 20s.

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:03.249 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful girl with sparkling
blue eyes, high forehead,

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:07.687 align:middle line:84%
you know, high cheek
bones, and this lovely smile

00:18:07.687 --> 00:18:09.422 align:middle line:84%
and the message coming
in from her.

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.759 align:middle line:84%
And again this is pure concept,
not words, but the words

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:15.962 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote down later
and she never said a word.

00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:17.664 align:middle line:90%
This was just her thoughts

00:18:17.664 --> 00:18:20.166 align:middle line:84%
and the word coming
straight into my awareness.

00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:26.472 align:middle line:84%
You are loved and cherished
dearly forever, you have nothing

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:30.944 align:middle line:84%
to fear, there's nothing you
can do wrong in this realm,

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.146 align:middle line:90%
in that spiritual realm.

00:18:33.146 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:90%
You will be taken care off.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.648 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:18:35.648 --> 00:18:41.588 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And it was such a
beautiful unconditionally loving

00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:43.189 align:middle line:90%
and comforting beyond words.

00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:45.692 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just to even recall
it now just gives me shivers

00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:50.029 align:middle line:84%
because it was so perfect
and wonderful and welcoming.

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:54.367 align:middle line:84%
Nothing to fear, there's such
a deep lesson in that for all

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:58.271 align:middle line:84%
of us because in fact that old
saying there's nothing to fear

00:18:58.271 --> 00:19:01.975 align:middle line:84%
but fear itself is far truer
than I ever, ever knew before.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:03.309 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.877 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And that fears the
source of any of the darkness

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:08.081 align:middle line:84%
and the badness and the material
realm as well as in some

00:19:08.081 --> 00:19:10.450 align:middle line:84%
of the lower aspects
of the spiritual realm.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.385 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: As you know
about the brain,

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:17.257 align:middle line:84%
when you recall this experience,
it lights up certain centers

00:19:17.257 --> 00:19:18.391 align:middle line:90%
of your brain that enables you

00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:21.694 align:middle line:84%
to re-live the experience
in certain ways.

00:19:21.694 --> 00:19:23.863 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're feeling?

00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:26.899 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, it's-- that's
very much the case, I would--

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:30.036 align:middle line:84%
it's important to
understand that a big part

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:33.506 align:middle line:84%
of the lesson I learned from
this journey as a neuroscientist

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.209 align:middle line:84%
as one whose interested
in brain, in mind

00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:40.179 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness is it
showed me very clearly

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.449 align:middle line:84%
that there is a tremendous
aspect

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:48.655 align:middle line:84%
of our conscious awareness
moment to moment that even

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:52.258 align:middle line:84%
if we had perfect infinite
knowledge of the state

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:90%
of the physical brain, moment

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.763 align:middle line:84%
to moment we would be
missing a tremendous amount

00:19:56.763 --> 00:19:59.499 align:middle line:90%
of how to explain it all.

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:02.735 align:middle line:84%
And that is the crucial
element that it showed me

00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:04.003 align:middle line:90%
and no uncertain terms,

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:06.939 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness is
the thing that exist.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:11.244 align:middle line:84%
That consciousness is
actually enriched tremendously

00:20:11.244 --> 00:20:16.149 align:middle line:84%
when it's freed up from the
shackles of the physical brain

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:19.385 align:middle line:84%
and the human mind dumb down
on this side of the veil

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.787 align:middle line:84%
and that's a very
important thing.

00:20:20.787 --> 00:20:22.188 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yeah, where
does conscious--

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:23.923 align:middle line:84%
where does consciousness exist
in the brain that hasn't been--

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:27.593 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: It-- consciousness
it not created by the brain.

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:28.528 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh--

00:20:28.528 --> 00:20:29.395 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: That is the
important thing.

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:90%
This is an old idea--

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: None of the lobes, none
of the cortexes, its not--

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.335 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: No, I mean

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:37.971 align:middle line:84%
in neuroscience we know a
tiny bit about consciousness.

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:41.007 align:middle line:84%
We know that there seems
to be an ignition system

00:20:41.007 --> 00:20:43.643 align:middle line:84%
in what's called a
reticular activating formation

00:20:43.643 --> 00:20:48.314 align:middle line:84%
down the lower brain stem
that that seems to be firing

00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:51.317 align:middle line:90%
in about a 40 hertz signal rate

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
up into what we call
thalamocortical loops did going

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.755 align:middle line:90%
up in the thalamus which is part

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.724 align:middle line:84%
of the deep gray
structure of the brain.

00:20:57.724 --> 00:21:00.626 align:middle line:84%
And there are hundreds
of millions

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:84%
of self referential
loops between neocortex

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.566 align:middle line:84%
and the thalamus deep
down in the brain.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And these loops are what we
think in neuroscience have to do

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.005 align:middle line:84%
with this phenomenon
of consciousness.

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:17.377 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you it's
a very primitive kind

00:21:17.377 --> 00:21:21.848 align:middle line:84%
of theory that's not very
well worked out and certainly

00:21:21.848 --> 00:21:25.351 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
explaining the true mechanism

00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:28.721 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness what
is it they gives us this

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:30.056 align:middle line:90%
conscious awareness.

00:21:30.056 --> 00:21:33.659 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that modern
neuroscience is absolutely moved

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:34.227 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:21:34.227 --> 00:21:35.194 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: No clue.

00:21:35.194 --> 00:21:37.096 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: They have
no clue whatsoever.

00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:39.232 align:middle line:90%
I mean its kindergarten level.

00:21:39.232 --> 00:21:41.267 align:middle line:84%
You know that's the
best they can offer.

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:44.437 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, in your
words, Dr. Alexander,

00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:46.806 align:middle line:90%
what is consciousness?

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.474 align:middle line:90%
What is awareness?

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: I think it's
important to--

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.911 align:middle line:84%
for the viewing audience
to realize

00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:54.046 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
is really this--

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:58.484 align:middle line:84%
this very simple thing that each
and everyone of us knows more

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.019 align:middle line:90%
than we know anything else.

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:05.258 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the only thing
that you can really kind of come

00:22:05.258 --> 00:22:07.293 align:middle line:90%
out and say you know exists.

00:22:07.293 --> 00:22:07.794 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:08.728 align:middle line:90%
[laughs].

00:22:08.728 --> 00:22:10.096 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Is your own
consciousness.

00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:13.099 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: This is true from an
experiential perspective, yes.

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:15.835 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, I mean
as a neuroscientist,

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:20.706 align:middle line:84%
I'd known for a long time
that what we see is reality,

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:22.708 align:middle line:90%
physical reality around us.

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:27.213 align:middle line:84%
For our entire life before we
were born, every single bit,

00:22:27.213 --> 00:22:33.186 align:middle line:84%
every bit of that reality is
patterns of neuronal firing

00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:34.253 align:middle line:90%
of nerves cells, brain,

00:22:34.253 --> 00:22:37.857 align:middle line:84%
cells firing patterns
in time and space.

00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:41.661 align:middle line:84%
And they're firing in this
complex three pound gelatinous

00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:45.398 align:middle line:84%
mass that's floating
in a warm dark bath.

00:22:45.398 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It could easily be
a computer program.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.335 align:middle line:84%
We're running in
some advance computer

00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:51.304 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't
know the difference.

00:22:51.304 --> 00:22:53.339 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you know
the difference because all

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:57.043 align:middle line:84%
of it has been coding, it's
been coding from the get-go

00:22:57.043 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
from before your birth
that's kind of saying

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.949 align:middle line:84%
that this correlates to that,
this correlates to that--

00:23:02.949 --> 00:23:04.117 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Neuro connections
are made.

00:23:04.117 --> 00:23:05.785 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: This create pattern
recognition machine.

00:23:05.785 --> 00:23:07.954 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't mean that any

00:23:07.954 --> 00:23:13.126 align:middle line:84%
of that external reality
is what it appears to be.

00:23:13.126 --> 00:23:15.428 align:middle line:84%
So, it's important to
remember that are view

00:23:15.428 --> 00:23:19.665 align:middle line:84%
of reality is simply a model of
something we think is out there.

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:23.803 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness is the
thing that truly does exist.

00:23:23.803 --> 00:23:24.604 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:23:24.604 --> 00:23:25.738 align:middle line:90%
It'd be interesting to find

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:28.674 align:middle line:84%
out how you live your
life differently know--

00:23:28.674 --> 00:23:30.009 align:middle line:90%
knowing all of that.

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:33.646 align:middle line:84%
I mean do you-- can you change
your reality in a moment?

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:37.717 align:middle line:84%
Do you-- are you letting go
of bad old habits and patterns

00:23:37.717 --> 00:23:40.019 align:middle line:84%
because you know how
consciousness this works now?

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:42.522 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, I can say
that it changed everything

00:23:42.522 --> 00:23:43.789 align:middle line:90%
about my life.

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:46.993 align:middle line:84%
The most important lesson
really and this came again

00:23:46.993 --> 00:23:49.595 align:middle line:84%
from the gift of severe
bacterium meningitis.

00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:50.997 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:23:50.997 --> 00:23:53.232 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: That should've disabled
all with the most rudimentary

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:57.136 align:middle line:84%
of conscious experience
at all and yet did not.

00:23:57.136 --> 00:24:00.406 align:middle line:84%
It was my previous self would
have said well the next step

00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:04.143 align:middle line:84%
beyond that earthworm eye view
was a state of nothingness.

00:24:04.143 --> 00:24:05.945 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
was so shocking

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:09.282 align:middle line:84%
because of the next state was
actually the blinders coming off

00:24:09.282 --> 00:24:13.953 align:middle line:84%
emerging into this
amazingly ultra real realm.

00:24:13.953 --> 00:24:15.421 align:middle line:84%
You know, the gateway
and the core

00:24:15.421 --> 00:24:20.092 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
incredible gift of it all.

00:24:20.092 --> 00:24:24.363 align:middle line:84%
And that is what showed me
that consciousness is freed

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:30.503 align:middle line:84%
up to much higher level when
it leaves the physical brain

00:24:30.503 --> 00:24:31.304 align:middle line:90%
and body.

00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:33.172 align:middle line:90%
When our body dies,

00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:37.743 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness is much
more aware going up into

00:24:37.743 --> 00:24:39.712 align:middle line:90%
that all knowing level.

00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:40.546 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's someone--

00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:42.415 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: And that part is what is

00:24:42.415 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:84%
so mind bending about
the journey.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.719 align:middle line:84%
That's what the book
is proof of,

00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:48.321 align:middle line:90%
it's proof of consciousness--

00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:49.422 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Consciousness.

00:24:49.422 --> 00:24:50.756 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- being independent
of the physical

00:24:50.756 --> 00:24:55.194 align:middle line:84%
and actually much grander and
actually setting the stage

00:24:55.194 --> 00:24:59.966 align:middle line:84%
on which all of the physical,
material universe unfolds.

00:24:59.966 --> 00:25:02.969 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, does that
lead you into realizing

00:25:02.969 --> 00:25:06.906 align:middle line:84%
that there's alternate
realities, parallel universes,

00:25:06.906 --> 00:25:10.109 align:middle line:84%
other dimensions, have you
thought about that or--

00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:13.479 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, I've thought about
that a lot and it actually--

00:25:13.479 --> 00:25:16.649 align:middle line:84%
I think to me it's--
it's amazing spiritually

00:25:16.649 --> 00:25:20.186 align:middle line:84%
and science actually strengthen
each other tremendously.

00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:26.058 align:middle line:84%
But the-- the issue with that
is science is the thing that's

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:28.794 align:middle line:84%
at the kindergarten
level, our current science

00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:32.565 align:middle line:84%
and that science needs to
greatly expand it's boundaries

00:25:32.565 --> 00:25:37.303 align:middle line:84%
to fully embrace the
mystery of consciousness

00:25:37.303 --> 00:25:41.107 align:middle line:84%
which is eternal soul and
spirit connected as one

00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:45.745 align:middle line:84%
at deeper levels and it's core
is driven completely by oneness

00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:50.549 align:middle line:84%
with the divine and creator
of the entire multivers.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.918 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we're
all connected down to

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.120 align:middle line:90%
through our consciousness.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.755 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Multivers, I love that.

00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:59.392 align:middle line:84%
Now, the face that
you saw of this girl,

00:25:59.392 --> 00:26:02.461 align:middle line:90%
you later recognized as--

00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:05.464 align:middle line:84%
explain this of the
face of your--

00:26:05.464 --> 00:26:07.333 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, I-- I
have to put out there.

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:11.237 align:middle line:84%
This is a spoiler alert to
those who haven't read the book

00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:14.907 align:middle line:84%
because that is kind of
a big part of the book.

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:15.541 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Nice.

00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:16.776 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:26:16.776 --> 00:26:18.511 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And it's-- I actually
love telling that story

00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:20.646 align:middle line:90%
to people in person even more

00:26:20.646 --> 00:26:24.083 align:middle line:84%
than I have enjoy having
them read it in the book

00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:27.987 align:middle line:84%
because telling it, sharing
stories is far more powerful.

00:26:27.987 --> 00:26:31.157 align:middle line:84%
But if we give out a
spoiler alert here to those

00:26:31.157 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
who are wanting to read the book
and get the full impact of it.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.095 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yeah, it's still
really a good journey.

00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:37.496 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:40.032 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: It is absolutely stunning
the revelation that came to me

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:42.368 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
wrestling for months,

00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:43.769 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to understand this.

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:46.639 align:middle line:84%
My older son having the fourth
who has majoring in neuroscience

00:26:46.639 --> 00:26:50.509 align:middle line:84%
in college when I-- when I came
out of the hospital, he saw me

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:52.678 align:middle line:84%
and he could tell there
was an incredible change.

00:26:52.678 --> 00:26:54.013 align:middle line:90%
I mean he was sure I was dead

00:26:54.013 --> 00:26:56.449 align:middle line:84%
from the first moment he
saw me in the hospital.

00:26:56.449 --> 00:26:58.417 align:middle line:84%
So, then he is very,
very shocked two

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and a half weeks later when
he comes home, you know,

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.489 align:middle line:84%
he's heard of course
that I survived at all

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:05.191 align:middle line:90%
that I was getting home

00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:08.227 align:middle line:84%
and he drove home overnight
two days before thanks giving

00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:09.995 align:middle line:90%
to surprise me.

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:13.699 align:middle line:84%
He saw me standing there at
the door 16 pounds lighter

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:15.668 align:middle line:84%
with an IV in my arm
still getting antibiotics

00:27:15.668 --> 00:27:17.103 align:middle line:90%
but he looked at me and said,

00:27:17.103 --> 00:27:18.871 align:middle line:84%
"It's like there was a
light shining in me."

00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:22.942 align:middle line:84%
Like I was so much more aware
than I'd ever been before.

00:27:22.942 --> 00:27:25.611 align:middle line:84%
And there had been a
profound transformation

00:27:25.611 --> 00:27:27.613 align:middle line:90%
and everybody could see that.

00:27:27.613 --> 00:27:31.617 align:middle line:84%
And he told me if you want
this to be of any value

00:27:31.617 --> 00:27:34.954 align:middle line:84%
to people you must write it all
down before you read anything

00:27:34.954 --> 00:27:37.857 align:middle line:84%
about near death experiences,
physics or cosmology

00:27:37.857 --> 00:27:39.658 align:middle line:84%
and before you talk
with anyone who is there

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:90%
when you're waking up.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.629 align:middle line:84%
It was invested by is anybody
has ever given me although I

00:27:43.629 --> 00:27:46.332 align:middle line:84%
wanted to read everything I
could but I had to put that off.

00:27:46.332 --> 00:27:47.666 align:middle line:90%
And over the six weeks I wrote

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:50.636 align:middle line:84%
about 20,000 words towards
the end of that six weeks is

00:27:50.636 --> 00:27:53.239 align:middle line:84%
when I was going back
talking to my neurologist

00:27:53.239 --> 00:27:56.242 align:middle line:84%
and there are surgeons who saw
me when I was ill, other doctors

00:27:56.242 --> 00:27:59.545 align:middle line:84%
who saw me when I was ill and
trying to understand I was going

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:02.915 align:middle line:84%
through my scans, going
through my neurologic exams,

00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:05.951 align:middle line:84%
going to the lab values and all
these information is the same.

00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:08.754 align:middle line:84%
But wait a minute,
this patient-- my--

00:28:08.754 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%
you know, Eben Alexander in coma

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.959 align:middle line:84%
with bacteria meningitis
should have died.

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:16.629 align:middle line:84%
Know that was, that
brain was not capable

00:28:16.629 --> 00:28:18.597 align:middle line:90%
of coming up with any of this.

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:19.965 align:middle line:84%
And so, then I had
to explain, "Well,

00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:21.367 align:middle line:90%
how did it happened then?"

00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to explain it
as a brain based phenomenon.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.641 align:middle line:84%
And I have the nine
hypotheses in the book

00:28:28.641 --> 00:28:30.176 align:middle line:90%
and there are more ideas in that

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:31.877 align:middle line:84%
that I talked over
with colleagues.

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that is so
powerful and the reason

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.049 align:middle line:84%
that this story is taken
to medical profession

00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:39.952 align:middle line:84%
and the scientific
world by storm is

00:28:39.952 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
because this severe bacterial
meningitis induced coma should

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.892 align:middle line:84%
have allowed for no
such experience at all.

00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:50.129 align:middle line:84%
And yet the experience
was clear as a ballot.

00:28:50.129 --> 00:28:53.199 align:middle line:84%
It was all there from when
I first was waking up.

00:28:53.199 --> 00:28:54.767 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You should have
had no recollection

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:55.968 align:middle line:90%
of anything whatsoever.

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:56.802 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:28:56.802 --> 00:28:57.536 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: No experience, nothing.

00:28:57.536 --> 00:28:58.237 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Zero, at all.

00:28:58.237 --> 00:28:59.605 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: No consciousness.

00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And that is the only
thing I knew when I came back.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.274 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Feel if you had.

00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:03.209 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: And then over six weeks,

00:29:03.209 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my knowing
came back.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.814 align:middle line:84%
Some of my critics say, "Well,
he's only a neurosurgeon.

00:29:08.814 --> 00:29:10.049 align:middle line:90%
He's not a neuroscientist.

00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:13.752 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I have to
confess, that somewhat true,

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:16.021 align:middle line:84%
neurosurgeons think they know
a lot about consciousness.

00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:17.656 align:middle line:90%
I thought I know a lot but we--

00:29:17.656 --> 00:29:20.526 align:middle line:84%
we know a few things about
how consciousness is shut

00:29:20.526 --> 00:29:21.861 align:middle line:90%
down in our patients.

00:29:21.861 --> 00:29:24.096 align:middle line:84%
We think we know ways
of bringing it back.

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:26.398 align:middle line:84%
We've been using general
anesthesia from more

00:29:26.398 --> 00:29:29.535 align:middle line:84%
than 150 years nobody on earth
can tell you the first thing

00:29:29.535 --> 00:29:33.038 align:middle line:84%
about how that truly works
at a beating consciousness.

00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:34.406 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:37.076 align:middle line:84%
That shows you how little we
truly know about consciousness

00:29:37.076 --> 00:29:40.946 align:middle line:84%
and that is a huge part
of the awakening here.

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:43.582 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
scientific world gets it.

00:29:43.582 --> 00:29:45.851 align:middle line:84%
This was an extraordinary
journey

00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:47.686 align:middle line:90%
because of that meningitis.

00:29:47.686 --> 00:29:49.722 align:middle line:84%
And because I should
not have recovered,

00:29:49.722 --> 00:29:53.759 align:middle line:84%
my doctors to this day have
no idea how I recovered.

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:56.028 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Now, I mean coming
from the consciousness world

00:29:56.028 --> 00:30:00.966 align:middle line:84%
from that, that realm, I am
curious about as we were talking

00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:04.536 align:middle line:84%
about the alternate realities
you mentioned the souls

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:05.104 align:middle line:90%
between lives.

00:30:05.104 --> 00:30:06.639 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That was so clear to you.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:08.974 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:30:08.974 --> 00:30:10.242 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: How have you known that?

00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:13.779 align:middle line:84%
And I still-- are you able
to tell us about the face?

00:30:13.779 --> 00:30:15.147 align:middle line:90%
Without being a spoiler.

00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:18.784 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Yes I can, I mean I have
to warn that it's a spoiler

00:30:18.784 --> 00:30:21.787 align:middle line:90%
but to get to that whole issue

00:30:21.787 --> 00:30:26.292 align:middle line:84%
about how I finally
came to realization.

00:30:26.292 --> 00:30:29.728 align:middle line:84%
I spent those six weeks writing
down everything I can remember.

00:30:29.728 --> 00:30:31.797 align:middle line:90%
Then I started reading

00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:34.566 align:middle line:84%
about near death
experiences and I read a lot.

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:36.435 align:middle line:84%
I ended up reading more
than a hundred books

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:37.970 align:middle line:90%
to try and understand.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:38.737 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: My goodness.

00:30:38.737 --> 00:30:39.872 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: All of my journey.

00:30:39.872 --> 00:30:41.907 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And you research
of course Raymond Moody.

00:30:41.907 --> 00:30:44.877 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: A lot, well-- and many,
many others and also I had

00:30:44.877 --> 00:30:47.613 align:middle line:84%
to get deeply into the
physics of consciousness.

00:30:47.613 --> 00:30:52.751 align:middle line:84%
I read a lot of Roger
Penrose, trying to get way

00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:57.056 align:middle line:84%
down Irreducible Mind towards a
psychology for the 21st century,

00:30:57.056 --> 00:31:01.126 align:middle line:84%
incredibly powerful book about
none local consciousness.

00:31:01.126 --> 00:31:05.331 align:middle line:84%
Also Pim van Lommel's wonderful
book, consciousness beyond life.

00:31:05.331 --> 00:31:08.267 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn a
tremendous amount trying

00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:09.501 align:middle line:90%
to get through this.

00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:13.072 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we moved out
there four months

00:31:13.072 --> 00:31:16.575 align:middle line:84%
out I was deeply mystified
because I came to realize

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:19.578 align:middle line:84%
that my journey should very
clearly the consciousness is

00:31:19.578 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
actually enriched
when it's freed

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.949 align:middle line:84%
up from the human
brain and body.

00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:84%
That there is a very rich light
between lies and as everything

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.089 align:middle line:84%
to do with the real
reason we're here.

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:33.959 align:middle line:84%
I came to see that reincarnation
is the only possible explanation

00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:36.762 align:middle line:84%
and that's a very
long involved story.

00:31:36.762 --> 00:31:37.896 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: From a neuroscientist
that's amazing.

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:39.164 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: But there's
no way to get right--

00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:43.469 align:middle line:84%
well, the scientific data
supporting reincarnation,

00:31:43.469 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:90%
past life memories,

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.440 align:middle line:84%
transpersonal psychology
is very, very strong.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.342 align:middle line:90%
There really is no denying.

00:31:50.342 --> 00:31:52.678 align:middle line:84%
People can deny like
I did before my comma

00:31:52.678 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because they refuse to
believe that's possible.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.383 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually start
looking into it you realize

00:31:57.383 --> 00:32:00.919 align:middle line:84%
that of course there's way
too much to it to just ignore.

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:02.121 align:middle line:90%
So, it's very real.

00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:03.589 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: You have to go
into that a little bit.

00:32:03.589 --> 00:32:04.523 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:32:04.523 --> 00:32:05.791 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
it's undeniably--

00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:06.792 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Well, for example--

00:32:06.792 --> 00:32:08.193 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- true, scientifically
true?

00:32:08.193 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well for example, well,
that source in general that I--

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:15.167 align:middle line:84%
I like for scientist is the
book Irreducible Mind toward a

00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:17.503 align:middle line:90%
psychology for the 21st century.

00:32:17.503 --> 00:32:19.905 align:middle line:84%
It's by Ed Kelly, Emily
Kelly, Bruce Grayson,

00:32:19.905 --> 00:32:22.908 align:middle line:84%
the whole division of perceptual
studies group at University

00:32:22.908 --> 00:32:26.412 align:middle line:84%
of Virginia to 800
pages of dents data

00:32:26.412 --> 00:32:29.915 align:middle line:84%
and analysis scientific
that shows

00:32:29.915 --> 00:32:33.852 align:middle line:84%
that none local consciousness
is absolutely real.

00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Near death experiences

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
after death communication
deathbed visions,

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.192 align:middle line:84%
past life memories,
reincarnation,

00:32:40.192 --> 00:32:44.396 align:middle line:84%
out of body experiences, remote
viewing of psychokinesis--

00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:45.931 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Just because
of the sheer numbers

00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:47.166 align:middle line:90%
of people that have done it?

00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:48.901 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, because of
cases that are well document

00:32:48.901 --> 00:32:50.569 align:middle line:84%
that have been well
studied that are--

00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:52.504 align:middle line:90%
that are absolutely undeniable.

00:32:52.504 --> 00:32:53.338 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Great

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: So, there's a lot of it.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.442 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:32:56.442 --> 00:32:58.243 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: It's undeniable and of
course the skeptics out there

00:32:58.243 --> 00:33:01.513 align:middle line:84%
who say can not exist have
refused to look into it.

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:02.481 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Well, it makes people--

00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:03.749 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: When you look
into it, it--

00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:06.018 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize
and of course I talk

00:33:06.018 --> 00:33:07.352 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of this people.

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:10.189 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced
so much on my own.

00:33:10.189 --> 00:33:12.124 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And makes people
like us that have experience

00:33:12.124 --> 00:33:13.459 align:middle line:90%
that realized we're not alone.

00:33:13.459 --> 00:33:14.126 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:33:14.126 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That's great.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.829 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And this is all
about science growing.

00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:18.964 align:middle line:90%
Science needs to mature.

00:33:18.964 --> 00:33:22.167 align:middle line:84%
The science that I
worshiped before my comma

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:26.004 align:middle line:84%
and believe me materialist
science is a faith

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:28.273 align:middle line:90%
based religion.

00:33:28.273 --> 00:33:31.477 align:middle line:84%
As much as materialist
science wants to tell you

00:33:31.477 --> 00:33:35.047 align:middle line:84%
that it has a method that
studies a nature of reality.

00:33:35.047 --> 00:33:38.016 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you that
same materialist science,

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:41.753 align:middle line:84%
conventional science that says
the physical brain creates

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:45.124 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is
absolutely false.

00:33:45.124 --> 00:33:47.893 align:middle line:84%
It's smoke and mirrors
that's why for them

00:33:47.893 --> 00:33:49.528 align:middle line:90%
to be talking about, you know,

00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:54.333 align:middle line:84%
a theory of everything I would
say it's quite a bit premature

00:33:54.333 --> 00:33:57.803 align:middle line:84%
when it best they might
understand a little bit

00:33:57.803 --> 00:34:00.806 align:middle line:84%
about 4 percent of what
they know exist based

00:34:00.806 --> 00:34:02.174 align:middle line:90%
on gravitational text.

00:34:02.174 --> 00:34:05.844 align:middle line:84%
The other 96 percent is dark
matter and dark energy and

00:34:05.844 --> 00:34:09.814 align:middle line:84%
yet that very same science
like I said is totally clueless

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:12.684 align:middle line:90%
on any kind of hypothesis

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:15.420 align:middle line:84%
about how the physical
brain might give rise

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.220 align:middle line:90%
to consciousness.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.622 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: And how--

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:19.057 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And certainly there at
a complete loss when it comes

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:20.459 align:middle line:90%
to none local consciousness.

00:34:20.459 --> 00:34:22.593 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Yes, yes I mean I notice
that you did your training

00:34:22.593 --> 00:34:23.762 align:middle line:90%
at Duke University where many

00:34:23.762 --> 00:34:26.131 align:middle line:84%
of these studies were
conducted decades ago.

00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:27.932 align:middle line:84%
So, that was a good
place to start.

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:30.401 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of your
colleagues now, they--

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.137 align:middle line:84%
how did they take
what you're saying?

00:34:32.137 --> 00:34:36.508 align:middle line:84%
You're basically discrediting
the entire scientific community.

00:34:36.508 --> 00:34:40.012 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well I-- I would like to
say Duke medical school is one

00:34:40.012 --> 00:34:44.115 align:middle line:84%
of the most forward thingking
scientific institutions I

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:44.783 align:middle line:90%
know of.

00:34:44.783 --> 00:34:45.784 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:46.785 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: As his Harvard
medical school,

00:34:46.785 --> 00:34:49.488 align:middle line:84%
they're both very
forward thinking.

00:34:49.488 --> 00:34:51.957 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people at
those institutions

00:34:51.957 --> 00:34:56.028 align:middle line:84%
and at other medical
schools have invited me to--

00:34:56.028 --> 00:34:57.429 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Talk, great.

00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.965 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Give presentations, you
know, I'm getting invitations,

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:03.435 align:middle line:84%
American college's surgeons
other groups this is

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:05.704 align:middle line:90%
about an awakening in science.

00:35:05.704 --> 00:35:09.541 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I don't think I have
to stress that a lot of nurses,

00:35:09.541 --> 00:35:12.678 align:middle line:84%
ICU nurses, hospice nurses
have know this forever.

00:35:12.678 --> 00:35:16.081 align:middle line:84%
It's not news to them,
they simply have seen

00:35:16.081 --> 00:35:18.350 align:middle line:84%
so much evidence
with their own eyes.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:19.751 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:21.353 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: When patients make that
transition and leave their body

00:35:21.353 --> 00:35:22.988 align:middle line:90%
when the physical body dies.

00:35:22.988 --> 00:35:25.023 align:middle line:90%
They know that soul is eternal.

00:35:25.023 --> 00:35:28.393 align:middle line:84%
They see evidence just like a
lot of family members do to.

00:35:28.393 --> 00:35:30.896 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors,
you know, would--

00:35:30.896 --> 00:35:35.200 align:middle line:84%
in recent decades doctors
have not been quite as likely

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.736 align:middle line:84%
as the nurses to be
there right to the end--

00:35:37.736 --> 00:35:38.537 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:35:38.537 --> 00:35:39.571 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: -- of physical life.

00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:40.772 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Nurses stand
a lot more times.

00:35:40.772 --> 00:35:42.374 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And so the doctors
have not seen as much.

00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:45.043 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of doctors
get this too.

00:35:45.043 --> 00:35:47.646 align:middle line:84%
So, it's very much
about sciences

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:50.882 align:middle line:84%
and the medical community
knowing this is real.

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:54.519 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that-- that
smoke and mirrors trick

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:57.789 align:middle line:84%
of materialist science that
pretends to be on the verge

00:35:57.789 --> 00:36:01.193 align:middle line:84%
of a theory of everything when
in fact it can not even begin

00:36:01.193 --> 00:36:04.496 align:middle line:84%
to explain the one thing
we all truly know exist

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.331 align:middle line:90%
which is our own consciousness.

00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:08.267 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And do you say
this in your lectures?

00:36:08.267 --> 00:36:09.568 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Yes, absolutely.

00:36:09.568 --> 00:36:12.504 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of the
scientific world is coming

00:36:12.504 --> 00:36:15.440 align:middle line:84%
out embracing us because
they know this is closer

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.842 align:middle line:90%
to the truth.

00:36:16.842 --> 00:36:20.479 align:middle line:84%
The hard problem consciousness,
the enigma of quantum mechanics.

00:36:20.479 --> 00:36:23.315 align:middle line:84%
They start to become much
more tractable when you start

00:36:23.315 --> 00:36:28.553 align:middle line:84%
to open the field of science
to fully embrace the eternal--

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:29.621 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That is why you're--

00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:31.056 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- existence
of soul and spirit.

00:36:31.056 --> 00:36:33.425 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- your story is very,
very important and powerful

00:36:33.425 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:90%
because it is bridging the gap

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.096 align:middle line:84%
where there're many have
put the legs on the bridge

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:40.799 align:middle line:84%
but you're a very big
peace of bridging that gap

00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:42.267 align:middle line:84%
between science and
consciousness.

00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:44.936 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- it's very
exciting to see.

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:47.172 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to take
you one more time back

00:36:47.172 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:90%
to the phase that was there--

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.441 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: OK

00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:50.842 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: -- because I
know it has something--

00:36:50.842 --> 00:36:52.744 align:middle line:84%
it has a very important part to
do with the end of your story

00:36:52.744 --> 00:36:55.047 align:middle line:84%
which is why you
included in the book?

00:36:55.047 --> 00:36:56.448 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:36:56.448 --> 00:37:00.652 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Is that phase-- now, you
had learned through your life,

00:37:00.652 --> 00:37:02.888 align:middle line:84%
your course of your life that
you were put up for adoption

00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:03.855 align:middle line:90%
at a certain point of your life.

00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:05.223 align:middle line:90%
At what age were you--

00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:09.761 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Right, my mother was
a sophomore in high school.

00:37:09.761 --> 00:37:10.896 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: OK.

00:37:10.896 --> 00:37:12.764 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And my father was
a senior in high school.

00:37:12.764 --> 00:37:15.801 align:middle line:84%
And they really couldn't
see anyway to get together.

00:37:15.801 --> 00:37:19.271 align:middle line:84%
And they'll also could
not see anyway to keep me.

00:37:19.271 --> 00:37:20.038 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: To raise a child?

00:37:20.038 --> 00:37:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.609 align:middle line:84%
My mother wanted to very much
her father could not keep a job.

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:29.915 align:middle line:84%
There was really no way as a
10th grade unmarried mother to--

00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:32.017 align:middle line:84%
to bring a new baby
into the home.

00:37:32.017 --> 00:37:34.353 align:middle line:84%
And so, finally, after
four months she had

00:37:34.353 --> 00:37:36.855 align:middle line:84%
to sign the papers to
give me up for adoption.

00:37:36.855 --> 00:37:39.825 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate I was
adopted into a loving family

00:37:39.825 --> 00:37:42.160 align:middle line:84%
that supported every
one of my dreams.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.663 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have asked
for better.

00:37:44.663 --> 00:37:48.834 align:middle line:84%
And like many adoptees
I would write letters

00:37:48.834 --> 00:37:51.870 align:middle line:84%
to the children's home, North
Carolina had very strict law.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.073 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes birthdates were
changed to make more difficult

00:37:55.073 --> 00:37:59.344 align:middle line:84%
for babies to reunite
with birth families.

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:04.249 align:middle line:84%
And I got use to the answer
to my letters to my inquiries

00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:06.718 align:middle line:84%
that said, "No, no
contact from your mother."

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:08.120 align:middle line:90%
And I let it go.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.921 align:middle line:84%
So, if it hadn't
been for the fact

00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:13.992 align:middle line:84%
that in the year 2000 my older
son Eben the fourth who at

00:38:13.992 --> 00:38:16.962 align:middle line:84%
that time was in sixth grade
in school in Massachusetts.

00:38:16.962 --> 00:38:21.133 align:middle line:84%
He was doing school
projects in family genealogy.

00:38:21.133 --> 00:38:23.068 align:middle line:84%
And Eben is always been
one of the students

00:38:23.068 --> 00:38:26.538 align:middle line:84%
who wouldn't leave a stone
unturned if he wanted

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:27.706 align:middle line:90%
to understand something.

00:38:27.706 --> 00:38:29.241 align:middle line:90%
It was torture for his teachers.

00:38:29.241 --> 00:38:32.711 align:middle line:84%
And so, when he had this
family project on, you know,

00:38:32.711 --> 00:38:36.681 align:middle line:84%
school project family
genealogy, he wouldn't let it go

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.150 align:middle line:84%
when I just told
him that, you know,

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.552 align:middle line:90%
adopted family stories at that.

00:38:40.552 --> 00:38:42.621 align:middle line:84%
This is family genealogy,
I want to know

00:38:42.621 --> 00:38:46.425 align:middle line:84%
about our birth heritage,
our biological roots.

00:38:46.425 --> 00:38:49.361 align:middle line:84%
And so, I decided out
humor and write a letter

00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:51.496 align:middle line:90%
to children's home which I did.

00:38:51.496 --> 00:38:53.965 align:middle line:84%
And I fully expect to get
the same answer I'd always

00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:55.033 align:middle line:90%
gotten before.

00:38:55.033 --> 00:38:57.369 align:middle line:90%
And that's not what happened.

00:38:57.369 --> 00:39:00.305 align:middle line:84%
And so, was in-- in February
of 2000 then I was driving

00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:03.608 align:middle line:84%
down the road with Eben the
fourth, we're going skiing

00:39:03.608 --> 00:39:05.911 align:middle line:84%
in Maine, we're driving
to a blizzard.

00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:08.213 align:middle line:84%
So, Friday afternoon
and I remembered, "Oh,

00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:10.415 align:middle line:84%
Betty said to call her"
she was a social worker

00:39:10.415 --> 00:39:11.249 align:middle line:90%
of the children's home.

00:39:11.249 --> 00:39:12.617 align:middle line:90%
She said to call her that day.

00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:14.052 align:middle line:90%
Maybe she'd have news.

00:39:14.052 --> 00:39:16.288 align:middle line:84%
I called her up and
she said, "Well yes,

00:39:16.288 --> 00:39:19.424 align:middle line:84%
I did find something out,
are you sitting down?

00:39:19.424 --> 00:39:22.427 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was driving through
a blizzard so that qualified.

00:39:22.427 --> 00:39:23.795 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Sitting down, yes.

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:26.832 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And she said, "Well,
your birth parents got married."

00:39:26.832 --> 00:39:29.868 align:middle line:84%
And I can not tell you
what a shock that was.

00:39:29.868 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Never in my life had I expected

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.439 align:middle line:84%
that they ended up
getting married.

00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:36.341 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, your mind
started racing I'm sure.

00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:37.442 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: My mind was racing

00:39:37.442 --> 00:39:40.212 align:middle line:84%
in fact I decided
I'd better pull over.

00:39:40.212 --> 00:39:43.281 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "They
had three children."

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:44.583 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness.

00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:47.786 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: But your youngest
sister died two years ago.

00:39:47.786 --> 00:39:50.288 align:middle line:90%
That would have been in 1998.

00:39:50.288 --> 00:39:53.992 align:middle line:84%
And they're still grieving over
that so it's not a good time

00:39:53.992 --> 00:39:56.061 align:middle line:90%
to come back in their lives.

00:39:56.061 --> 00:39:59.998 align:middle line:84%
And that phone call that--
then I hang up and that was it.

00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:02.767 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was left with.

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:04.069 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Turns you
entirely on upside down.

00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:05.604 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: It turned
everything upside down

00:40:05.604 --> 00:40:08.440 align:middle line:90%
and I really didn't realize.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.309 align:middle line:84%
You know, at that time I
just kind of stuffed it.

00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:15.947 align:middle line:84%
But I came to realize
over months and years then

00:40:15.947 --> 00:40:20.685 align:middle line:84%
in fact it started my
whole life unraveling.

00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: How--

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.655 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: It started
everything to turn around

00:40:23.655 --> 00:40:30.195 align:middle line:84%
and it was seven years later
that finally my sisters walking

00:40:30.195 --> 00:40:32.764 align:middle line:84%
on the beach one day on a
family vacations said, "Well,

00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:35.066 align:middle line:84%
don't you think it's
about time you reached

00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:37.569 align:middle line:90%
out to your birth family again."

00:40:37.569 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh gosh.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.239 align:middle line:84%
I remembered how
that it took me over.

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:42.908 align:middle line:84%
But I thought I guess
they're right.

00:40:42.908 --> 00:40:46.711 align:middle line:84%
So, I wrote another letter that
was in a year before my coma.

00:40:46.711 --> 00:40:49.414 align:middle line:90%
That was in August of 2007.

00:40:49.414 --> 00:40:53.251 align:middle line:84%
Wrote a letter to them and ended
up getting a positive response

00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:57.289 align:middle line:84%
and October 5th, 2007,
I met my birth parents.

00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:59.925 align:middle line:90%
I had not seen them in 54 years.

00:40:59.925 --> 00:41:03.295 align:middle line:84%
And that is a beautiful
story in its own right.

00:41:03.295 --> 00:41:04.095 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:41:04.095 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: An amazing adventure.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:08.266 align:middle line:84%
Meeting them, the next
day meeting my brother

00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:09.734 align:middle line:90%
and sister and of course--

00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:11.102 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Oh my goodness.

00:41:11.102 --> 00:41:13.138 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- introducing adoptive
and birth families and a lot

00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:17.175 align:middle line:84%
of back and forth,
tremendous beautiful experience

00:41:17.175 --> 00:41:20.779 align:middle line:84%
that has been, always
a little bitter sweet.

00:41:20.779 --> 00:41:22.347 align:middle line:90%
Because at the back of it all,

00:41:22.347 --> 00:41:26.518 align:middle line:84%
deep at the core was Betsy
[assumed spelling] was gone long

00:41:26.518 --> 00:41:28.053 align:middle line:90%
before I even knew she existed.

00:41:28.053 --> 00:41:31.556 align:middle line:84%
And that part always
brought some sadness.

00:41:31.556 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a lot
that I knew about her,

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.832 align:middle line:84%
wasn't like they really like
dwelling on that topic and--

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:42.634 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: How old was
she when she passed?

00:41:42.634 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: She was 36
when she passed.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:49.107 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's where
everything comes together

00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:50.909 align:middle line:90%
to answer your question.

00:41:50.909 --> 00:41:53.445 align:middle line:84%
Because my other sister
Cathy [assumed spelling],

00:41:53.445 --> 00:41:55.146 align:middle line:90%
by birth sister, had told me

00:41:55.146 --> 00:41:57.916 align:middle line:84%
that someday she would
send me a picture of Betsy.

00:41:57.916 --> 00:42:01.353 align:middle line:84%
And that picture arrived about
four months after my coma

00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:04.222 align:middle line:84%
when I was deeply
into wrestling,

00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:05.790 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to understand it.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:09.594 align:middle line:84%
I'd come to realize that it
was a very authentic journey

00:42:09.594 --> 00:42:13.498 align:middle line:84%
that absolutely validated so
many other experiences reported

00:42:13.498 --> 00:42:16.334 align:middle line:84%
over 3,000 years, not just
near death experiences

00:42:16.334 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:84%
but afterlife literature
back to the ancient Greeks--

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:19.871 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:20.905 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: -- and Egyptians.

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.808 align:middle line:84%
And the stories of
mystics and prophets

00:42:23.808 --> 00:42:25.677 align:middle line:90%
over thousands of years.

00:42:25.677 --> 00:42:28.346 align:middle line:84%
All validated very
real and understanding

00:42:28.346 --> 00:42:32.717 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness and yet
to me as I read more and more

00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:34.653 align:middle line:84%
of these near-death
experiences coming

00:42:34.653 --> 00:42:37.255 align:middle line:90%
to realize where was my father.

00:42:37.255 --> 00:42:40.325 align:middle line:84%
If I had scripted this
my father who had passed

00:42:40.325 --> 00:42:43.428 align:middle line:84%
over four years before my coma
would have been there front

00:42:43.428 --> 00:42:44.229 align:middle line:90%
and center.

00:42:44.229 --> 00:42:46.231 align:middle line:90%
He was no where to be found.

00:42:46.231 --> 00:42:48.767 align:middle line:84%
And who in the world
was that beautiful girl

00:42:48.767 --> 00:42:49.801 align:middle line:90%
in the butterfly wings?

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:51.169 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, right.

00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:53.071 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: I saw her many times,
every time I pass through there

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:55.407 align:middle line:84%
and I remember her
face so perfectly.

00:42:55.407 --> 00:42:58.109 align:middle line:84%
I will never forget
everything about her.

00:42:58.109 --> 00:43:00.045 align:middle line:90%
I remember her so clearly.

00:43:00.045 --> 00:43:02.814 align:middle line:84%
I knew I'd never
met her in my life.

00:43:02.814 --> 00:43:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And that part was
a huge mystery.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:09.487 align:middle line:84%
And it all came together four
months after my coma and I got

00:43:09.487 --> 00:43:13.391 align:middle line:84%
that picture from Cathy
with this poem emblazed

00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:17.362 align:middle line:84%
into [inaudible] that's in the
book When I'm not here Tomorrow,

00:43:17.362 --> 00:43:21.199 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful poem that was
written by David Romano.

00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:25.637 align:middle line:84%
And that, I remember tears just
filling my eyes as I was looking

00:43:25.637 --> 00:43:27.172 align:middle line:84%
at this picture,
reading this poem,

00:43:27.172 --> 00:43:29.207 align:middle line:84%
it was just such an
emotional moment.

00:43:29.207 --> 00:43:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I put that up on my dresser
and it was the next morning

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.013 align:middle line:84%
when I was reading an Elizabeth
Kubler Ross' book on Death

00:43:35.013 --> 00:43:37.782 align:middle line:84%
and Dying, a story
about a 13-year-old girl

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:40.552 align:middle line:84%
who had a powerful
near death experience.

00:43:40.552 --> 00:43:41.953 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.423 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Deep coma was welcome to
heaven by her brother was shown

00:43:45.423 --> 00:43:48.860 align:middle line:84%
that incredible unconditional
love and its infinite power.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.397 align:middle line:84%
He helped her to make a
decision about coming back

00:43:52.397 --> 00:43:54.099 align:middle line:90%
to this world which he did.

00:43:54.099 --> 00:43:57.936 align:middle line:84%
And when she did, she was
mystified over the experience.

00:43:57.936 --> 00:44:00.972 align:middle line:84%
She would talk with her
father, I don't understand,

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:02.841 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a brother.

00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:07.212 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, you did
but he died four months,

00:44:07.212 --> 00:44:08.613 align:middle line:84%
three months before
you were born

00:44:08.613 --> 00:44:11.149 align:middle line:90%
so we never told you about it."

00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:13.952 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up at the
picture on by dresser.

00:44:13.952 --> 00:44:17.522 align:middle line:84%
And immediately saw that
girl on the butterfly wing.

00:44:17.522 --> 00:44:20.225 align:middle line:84%
And in the picture,
she's looking at me like,

00:44:20.225 --> 00:44:22.327 align:middle line:90%
do you finally get it?

00:44:22.327 --> 00:44:24.262 align:middle line:90%
And it was the most shocking--

00:44:24.262 --> 00:44:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.265 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- revelation of my
entire existence reaching

00:44:27.265 --> 00:44:29.901 align:middle line:84%
across all those
dimensions proving--

00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:31.302 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:44:31.302 --> 00:44:34.339 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- with great power to
me the reality of that journey

00:44:34.339 --> 00:44:37.942 align:middle line:84%
in a way that I would
never ever doubt it again.

00:44:37.942 --> 00:44:40.111 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you had never
seen her picture before

00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:43.414 align:middle line:84%
and this beautiful picture
of a face that came to you

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:46.851 align:middle line:84%
in that experience-- in the
near-death experience showed

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.621 align:middle line:84%
up in a photo of your sister
who passed three years of prior.

00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:50.922 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Yes.

00:44:50.922 --> 00:44:53.992 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- I think a big
catalyst and it was reading

00:44:53.992 --> 00:44:57.328 align:middle line:84%
that Elizabeth Kubler
Ross story because--

00:44:57.328 --> 00:44:58.229 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Which part of it?

00:44:58.229 --> 00:44:59.597 align:middle line:90%
The acceptance?

00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:02.267 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, the fact that this
girl I had always, you know,

00:45:02.267 --> 00:45:05.436 align:middle line:84%
to that point I'd come
to think that, you know,

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:09.941 align:middle line:84%
such a guardian angel as I'd
come to call her in my writings

00:45:09.941 --> 00:45:13.778 align:middle line:84%
with somebody of great
importance to you in this life.

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:16.581 align:middle line:84%
And so, I kept looking
for people, you know,

00:45:16.581 --> 00:45:20.318 align:middle line:84%
in my life who I'd met
in this physical life.

00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:24.656 align:middle line:84%
And it never entered my mind
that it could be a soul,

00:45:24.656 --> 00:45:28.493 align:middle line:84%
a very dear close
importance to me

00:45:28.493 --> 00:45:30.962 align:middle line:84%
that I'd never known
in this life.

00:45:30.962 --> 00:45:33.231 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
revelation that I really got

00:45:33.231 --> 00:45:35.834 align:middle line:84%
from that Elizabeth
Kubler Ross story.

00:45:35.834 --> 00:45:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Did you ever think
about the words that--

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.608 align:middle line:84%
the message, I should say, that
she gave you that you are loved,

00:45:43.608 --> 00:45:47.512 align:middle line:90%
that you are-- that you are OK.

00:45:47.512 --> 00:45:51.583 align:middle line:84%
Has that changed the way
that you live your life now?

00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:53.952 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: It's totally
changed everything.

00:45:53.952 --> 00:45:57.255 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is realizing, as
I pointed out in the book.

00:45:57.255 --> 00:46:03.294 align:middle line:84%
I kind of used the metaphor,
the whole story of my adoption

00:46:03.294 --> 00:46:06.464 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that I was kind of
separated from my roots and in

00:46:06.464 --> 00:46:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that sense was kind of
unloving, unlovable detached

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.072 align:middle line:90%
from my true identity.

00:46:14.072 --> 00:46:14.873 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:46:14.873 --> 00:46:16.074 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: So, on a soul level,

00:46:16.074 --> 00:46:17.375 align:middle line:84%
that's what you were
really, really looking for.

00:46:17.375 --> 00:46:18.643 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: That's-- well, that's
kind of what I was seeing

00:46:18.643 --> 00:46:22.213 align:middle line:84%
in my life because of that
adoption story in my life.

00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And yet what I came to see in
my coma journey very clearly.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:29.754 align:middle line:84%
And this is the truth that
applies to all of us is

00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:34.959 align:middle line:84%
that when we buy into this
kind of scientific materialism

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:37.695 align:middle line:90%
in this secular thinking,

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:41.733 align:middle line:84%
the material world
is all that there is.

00:46:41.733 --> 00:46:47.071 align:middle line:84%
That's false and its terrible
misleading because it allows us

00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:53.378 align:middle line:84%
to forget that we are divine,
that we are infinitely loved--

00:46:53.378 --> 00:46:54.712 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right, right.

00:46:54.712 --> 00:46:56.915 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- by the creative
power of this entire universe.

00:46:56.915 --> 00:46:58.283 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:46:58.283 --> 00:47:01.953 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And are forever loved
and it's an unconditional love

00:47:01.953 --> 00:47:05.123 align:middle line:90%
that demands nothing from us.

00:47:05.123 --> 00:47:09.494 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, I know also the
richer aspects of our journey,

00:47:09.494 --> 00:47:13.164 align:middle line:84%
of our many lives, incarnation
that it's all about love,

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:15.600 align:middle line:84%
compassion, forgiveness
in the ascendance

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.402 align:middle line:84%
of our souls in that
higher realm.

00:47:17.402 --> 00:47:18.703 align:middle line:90%
So, it's not as if we come in

00:47:18.703 --> 00:47:22.106 align:middle line:84%
and can just do anything
we want and be mean and--

00:47:22.106 --> 00:47:23.408 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:47:23.408 --> 00:47:24.809 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- you'll pass out
pain and suffering to others

00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:28.980 align:middle line:84%
because we are here to learn the
lessons that that is not the way

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.649 align:middle line:90%
to live and we will reap.

00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:34.018 align:middle line:84%
You know, what we saw when
it comes to that kind of--

00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:35.553 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, you know
this for sure now?

00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:36.087 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Yes.

00:47:36.087 --> 00:47:37.288 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:47:37.288 --> 00:47:38.656 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: I mean that is
part of the deepest lesson

00:47:38.656 --> 00:47:42.894 align:middle line:84%
that was there in that
core realm is that love,

00:47:42.894 --> 00:47:45.663 align:middle line:84%
that unconditional love,
compassion, forgiveness,

00:47:45.663 --> 00:47:49.834 align:middle line:84%
coming to see soul mates in the
very richest that soul mate--

00:47:49.834 --> 00:47:51.569 align:middle line:84%
a soul mate might
be someone who,

00:47:51.569 --> 00:47:53.338 align:middle line:84%
before my coma, I
saw as my enemy.

00:47:53.338 --> 00:47:56.607 align:middle line:84%
Soul mates come in many
forms, we're here to learn

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:59.944 align:middle line:84%
from our soul mates and
to teach our soul mates.

00:47:59.944 --> 00:48:00.912 align:middle line:90%
And after my coma--

00:48:00.912 --> 00:48:02.347 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Interesting.

00:48:02.347 --> 00:48:05.116 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: I came to see that often,
a soul mate might be someone

00:48:05.116 --> 00:48:08.186 align:middle line:84%
who before I'd seen as
an enemy or my nemesis

00:48:08.186 --> 00:48:10.922 align:middle line:84%
who in fact was there to
help me learn a very deep

00:48:10.922 --> 00:48:11.656 align:middle line:90%
though lessons.

00:48:11.656 --> 00:48:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Wow.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:13.825 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: And the other way around.

00:48:13.825 --> 00:48:18.096 align:middle line:84%
Often I'm helping them learn
a very deep and tough lesson

00:48:18.096 --> 00:48:19.731 align:middle line:84%
and that is what
we are here to do.

00:48:19.731 --> 00:48:24.035 align:middle line:84%
This is soul school, this is
where we learn these lessons

00:48:24.035 --> 00:48:28.873 align:middle line:84%
but to begin to comprehend them,
you must have an open concept

00:48:28.873 --> 00:48:32.510 align:middle line:84%
about reincarnation and about
how it's not just birth to death

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.246 align:middle line:84%
because if you just think it's
birth to death nothing more,

00:48:35.246 --> 00:48:38.282 align:middle line:84%
there's no way you can possibly
see the much grander scheme

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:39.617 align:middle line:90%
of it all.

00:48:39.617 --> 00:48:40.918 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Well, speaking of grand
schemes, you ever thought

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:44.455 align:middle line:90%
about why you came back.

00:48:44.455 --> 00:48:48.693 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, for the longest
time I was trying to explain it,

00:48:48.693 --> 00:48:50.395 align:middle line:84%
you know, as a brain
based phenomenon,

00:48:50.395 --> 00:48:52.930 align:middle line:84%
as a neuroscientist
trying to learn something

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.234 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness then I have
the revelation that showed me

00:48:56.234 --> 00:49:00.471 align:middle line:84%
that it actually was
so much that validation

00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:04.675 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual journeys of sharing
similarities with thousands

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:07.645 align:middle line:84%
of other journeys reported
over thousands of years.

00:49:07.645 --> 00:49:09.047 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yeah.

00:49:09.047 --> 00:49:11.883 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And as I would talk more
and more with other experiences

00:49:11.883 --> 00:49:14.085 align:middle line:84%
and with other people
about all this.

00:49:14.085 --> 00:49:15.119 align:middle line:90%
People would keep telling me,

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:17.121 align:middle line:84%
you know this happened
for a reason.

00:49:17.121 --> 00:49:18.322 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes, yes.

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.324 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And of course I
was trying to approach it

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.860 align:middle line:84%
as the objective
doctor, you know,

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.663 align:middle line:84%
as much as I could realizing
that they're deep lessons there

00:49:25.663 --> 00:49:28.533 align:middle line:90%
for all of us but denying

00:49:28.533 --> 00:49:31.135 align:middle line:84%
that there could be
anything special about me.

00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:36.874 align:middle line:84%
And in fact I still think that
the special thing about me is

00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:39.544 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just like
everybody else.

00:49:39.544 --> 00:49:43.414 align:middle line:84%
I have the same, you know,
problems and foibles in life.

00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:48.786 align:middle line:84%
I'm absolutely no saint
at all and, you know,

00:49:48.786 --> 00:49:50.588 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like all
the rest of us.

00:49:50.588 --> 00:49:56.494 align:middle line:84%
I'm just, you know, a normal
person and so many times

00:49:56.494 --> 00:49:59.263 align:middle line:84%
when people would say that
to me about this happened

00:49:59.263 --> 00:50:00.965 align:middle line:90%
to you for a special reason.

00:50:00.965 --> 00:50:04.836 align:middle line:84%
I would think back to the fact
I was given away as a baby,

00:50:04.836 --> 00:50:08.372 align:middle line:84%
and that gives me
a real commonality

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.808 align:middle line:90%
with each and every one of us.

00:50:10.808 --> 00:50:15.313 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have that kind
of sense of being detached.

00:50:15.313 --> 00:50:17.815 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Have you even tapped
into that message though

00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:21.652 align:middle line:84%
to tell people who have been
adopted that they are loved?

00:50:21.652 --> 00:50:23.354 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Oh, I tap into
that message a lot.

00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:23.888 align:middle line:90%
And this--

00:50:23.888 --> 00:50:25.289 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Good.

00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:26.491 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- and the thing is of
course this message is not just

00:50:26.491 --> 00:50:29.026 align:middle line:84%
for adpotees to realize
that they are deeply loved

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:32.363 align:middle line:84%
and cherished and have
been in this earthly realm

00:50:32.363 --> 00:50:36.367 align:middle line:84%
by that family that had to
let them go out of the love.

00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:38.736 align:middle line:84%
But it's also that
much grander message,

00:50:38.736 --> 00:50:41.305 align:middle line:84%
the same message
though, to all the rest

00:50:41.305 --> 00:50:43.407 align:middle line:90%
of us, to every one of us.

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:44.275 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: That we are loved.

00:50:44.275 --> 00:50:45.409 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: That each and every one

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:48.613 align:middle line:84%
of us is an infinitely
powerful light being,

00:50:48.613 --> 00:50:53.618 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual being eternal loved
beyond our wildest imagination

00:50:53.618 --> 00:50:55.786 align:middle line:90%
by the creator of this universe.

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:57.788 align:middle line:90%
And that we are all one.

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:58.856 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:50:58.856 --> 00:50:59.957 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And it's a
beautiful gift to share.

00:50:59.957 --> 00:51:01.759 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: That was the
biggest message I got

00:51:01.759 --> 00:51:04.529 align:middle line:84%
when I had my experience
was that of oneness.

00:51:04.529 --> 00:51:07.965 align:middle line:84%
Now, you spend a lot of time in
meditation now still don't you?

00:51:07.965 --> 00:51:10.067 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, I came
to realize of course

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.537 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
was right at the core

00:51:12.537 --> 00:51:14.772 align:middle line:84%
of everything I was
trying to understand.

00:51:14.772 --> 00:51:17.742 align:middle line:84%
And also to realize that
the linguistic brain,

00:51:17.742 --> 00:51:21.479 align:middle line:84%
that little voice in our head
actually gets in the way.

00:51:21.479 --> 00:51:25.183 align:middle line:84%
You know, before my coma, I
felt the voice in our head is,

00:51:25.183 --> 00:51:28.152 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's the pinnacle
of intellectual achievement

00:51:28.152 --> 00:51:29.420 align:middle line:90%
in the known universe.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.558 align:middle line:84%
Is that little rational
logical kind of scientific voice

00:51:33.558 --> 00:51:35.626 align:middle line:84%
of our thinking mind
of the intellect

00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:39.230 align:middle line:90%
of the well read inteligencia.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.667 align:middle line:84%
Well, fact of the matter is
there's far deeper knowing

00:51:42.667 --> 00:51:44.735 align:middle line:90%
that's far richer than anything

00:51:44.735 --> 00:51:47.672 align:middle line:84%
that voice can ever
put into words.

00:51:47.672 --> 00:51:49.240 align:middle line:90%
I knew as a neurosurgeon

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:84%
that that little voice is
just the tiniest fraction

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.346 align:middle line:84%
of your brain is involved
in that little voice.

00:51:55.346 --> 00:51:58.683 align:middle line:84%
And there're are two regions
that have to do with production

00:51:58.683 --> 00:52:00.251 align:middle line:90%
of speech and reception

00:52:00.251 --> 00:52:02.887 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
of speech connected.

00:52:02.887 --> 00:52:04.555 align:middle line:84%
But they're very small
part of the brain.

00:52:04.555 --> 00:52:06.691 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those
things that kind of leads

00:52:06.691 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
to a misunderstanding about
what is consciousness.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.995 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: What is chatter
for that reason?

00:52:10.995 --> 00:52:12.063 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Yeah, what
is mind chatter?

00:52:12.063 --> 00:52:13.564 align:middle line:84%
We know what is a
mind chatter is.

00:52:13.564 --> 00:52:16.934 align:middle line:84%
And of course I also knew of the
experiments from Benjamin Libet

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:19.403 align:middle line:84%
and others beginning
in early 1980s

00:52:19.403 --> 00:52:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that that little voice is
not even the decision maker.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.510 align:middle line:84%
That little voice is actually
informed of the decision of 100

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:30.448 align:middle line:84%
to 150 milliseconds after
the decision is made.

00:52:30.448 --> 00:52:31.749 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:31.749 --> 00:52:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: So, your mind chatter
is not the decision maker?

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:33.718 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: No, not at all.

00:52:33.718 --> 00:52:35.453 align:middle line:84%
And you-- that's
something that--

00:52:35.453 --> 00:52:36.787 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: How do you know that?

00:52:36.787 --> 00:52:39.423 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Neuroscientist have
known that for 30 or 40 years.

00:52:39.423 --> 00:52:42.226 align:middle line:84%
That the little voice
is-- and it--

00:52:42.226 --> 00:52:45.863 align:middle line:84%
I reference this in my book, the
experiments of Benjamin Libet

00:52:45.863 --> 00:52:48.099 align:middle line:84%
and then others who
followed suit.

00:52:48.099 --> 00:52:50.902 align:middle line:84%
And I described the
experiment on my book.

00:52:50.902 --> 00:52:54.005 align:middle line:90%
But basically that little voice,

00:52:54.005 --> 00:52:58.109 align:middle line:84%
you can show an electrical
recording of cortical activity

00:52:58.109 --> 00:53:03.281 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that when we make a
spontaneous freewill decisions,

00:53:03.281 --> 00:53:06.651 align:middle line:84%
the decision is actually
made before

00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:10.221 align:middle line:84%
that voice says it's
made the decision.

00:53:10.221 --> 00:53:14.292 align:middle line:84%
And that was well documented
and has been well shown.

00:53:14.292 --> 00:53:17.962 align:middle line:84%
Of course then, in the
traditional psychology world,

00:53:17.962 --> 00:53:21.599 align:middle line:84%
that starts bringing up issues
of consciousness, subconscious,

00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:24.168 align:middle line:84%
unconscious, superconscious,
you know,

00:53:24.168 --> 00:53:26.437 align:middle line:84%
universal consciousness
et cetera.

00:53:26.437 --> 00:53:29.573 align:middle line:84%
And again, those were all
linguistic definitions

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:33.044 align:middle line:84%
and they're kind of
misleading like so many aspects

00:53:33.044 --> 00:53:35.446 align:middle line:90%
of the linguistic brain are.

00:53:35.446 --> 00:53:38.983 align:middle line:84%
The linguistic brain is
heavily tied to self and ego.

00:53:38.983 --> 00:53:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Self and ego are important
ideas in kind of survival

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.857 align:middle line:84%
and materialist Darwinian
world but they get in the way

00:53:46.857 --> 00:53:50.127 align:middle line:84%
of a deeper knowing that
is our true consciousness.

00:53:50.127 --> 00:53:53.998 align:middle line:84%
I came to realize meditation
is the key to getting there.

00:53:53.998 --> 00:53:54.532 align:middle line:90%
Getting deep--

00:53:54.532 --> 00:53:55.599 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:56.434 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: -- exploring
into consciousness--

00:53:56.434 --> 00:53:57.268 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:53:57.268 --> 00:53:58.502 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: -- is absolutely the key.

00:53:58.502 --> 00:54:00.771 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Did you meditate
before your experience as--

00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:03.708 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: I had done something
called silver mind control back

00:54:03.708 --> 00:54:04.642 align:middle line:90%
when I was in college.

00:54:04.642 --> 00:54:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Right.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.812 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: The parachute team,
we did silver mind control

00:54:07.812 --> 00:54:09.847 align:middle line:90%
to practice free fall formations

00:54:09.847 --> 00:54:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and meditation before
we went and did the job.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.051 align:middle line:84%
So, it helped us to
do a better job--

00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:14.752 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Great.

00:54:14.752 --> 00:54:16.153 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: -- in freefall.

00:54:16.153 --> 00:54:19.223 align:middle line:84%
But then I let the meditation
go and it was only after my coma

00:54:19.223 --> 00:54:21.125 align:middle line:90%
that I got back into it.

00:54:21.125 --> 00:54:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And currently I'm
very interested

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.162 align:middle line:90%
in using sound techniques.

00:54:25.162 --> 00:54:26.364 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:54:26.364 --> 00:54:28.332 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: I mentioned in my
book Robert Monroe's work

00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Out of Body Experiences that
he had using what he call the

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.340 align:middle line:84%
hemispheric synchronization
or Hemi-sync.

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:40.778 align:middle line:84%
And I now work with a group
called Sacred Acoustics,

00:54:40.778 --> 00:54:43.214 align:middle line:90%
at sacredacustics.com.

00:54:43.214 --> 00:54:44.949 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: Oh, and it uses
those binaural beats

00:54:44.949 --> 00:54:46.484 align:middle line:90%
and that Hemi-sync technology?

00:54:46.484 --> 00:54:47.685 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Luckily with
Karen [assumed spelling]

00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:49.653 align:middle line:84%
and Kevin [assumed
spelling] of Sacred Acoustics,

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:53.557 align:middle line:84%
we are making new
exercises everyday or two.

00:54:53.557 --> 00:54:58.295 align:middle line:84%
So, we're actively evolving
how these exercises can go

00:54:58.295 --> 00:54:59.697 align:middle line:90%
and how powerful they are.

00:54:59.697 --> 00:55:02.466 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And they get you into an
altered state of consciousness.

00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:03.868 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:55:03.868 --> 00:55:06.203 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced, based on
the fact that my meningitis,

00:55:06.203 --> 00:55:09.807 align:middle line:84%
which as I said, by inactivating
my neocortex taking it all

00:55:09.807 --> 00:55:12.877 align:middle line:84%
flying, it actually took
the blinders of which opened

00:55:12.877 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:84%
up into this much
richer ultra reality.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.784 align:middle line:84%
Not stuck in time and
space and here and now.

00:55:19.784 --> 00:55:22.586 align:middle line:84%
I though, well, maybe
hemispheric synchronization

00:55:22.586 --> 00:55:24.822 align:middle line:84%
that is some kind of
auditory signaling

00:55:24.822 --> 00:55:30.194 align:middle line:84%
that would ring my signals of my
brain, the electrical activity

00:55:30.194 --> 00:55:34.465 align:middle line:84%
into more of a homogeneous
state just as my meningitis did.

00:55:34.465 --> 00:55:37.268 align:middle line:84%
That might enable
my awareness to get

00:55:37.268 --> 00:55:41.472 align:middle line:84%
into non local consciousness,
that much grander consciousness

00:55:41.472 --> 00:55:44.308 align:middle line:90%
that exists independently of us.

00:55:44.308 --> 00:55:46.510 align:middle line:84%
That is what near death
experiences bring back

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:48.512 align:middle line:90%
with them, glimpses of that.

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: To try to explain.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.047 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:55:50.047 --> 00:55:51.348 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:52.049 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: We have a picture of
your beautiful family here

00:55:52.049 --> 00:55:53.217 align:middle line:90%
and what do they think

00:55:53.217 --> 00:55:56.320 align:middle line:84%
about their neuroscientist
dad turned meditator

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.657 align:middle line:90%
and acoustic sound producer.

00:55:59.657 --> 00:56:02.726 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: They're very
much into this.

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:05.963 align:middle line:84%
They certainly realized
they were transformed

00:56:05.963 --> 00:56:07.932 align:middle line:84%
by this experience
in a tremendous way

00:56:07.932 --> 00:56:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: And your relationship
with them as well.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.735 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, I can tell
you that when you go

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:15.773 align:middle line:84%
through this powerful,
absolutely shocking,

00:56:15.773 --> 00:56:21.245 align:middle line:84%
life-changing experience of this
degree, everybody gets changed.

00:56:21.245 --> 00:56:22.279 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:56:22.279 --> 00:56:23.647 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Not just in
the immediate family

00:56:23.647 --> 00:56:26.984 align:middle line:90%
but the ripples go far and wide.

00:56:26.984 --> 00:56:28.319 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:32.523 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And many, many family,
extended family, friends,

00:56:32.523 --> 00:56:34.558 align:middle line:84%
far beyond that range
are affected

00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:36.760 align:middle line:90%
by exactly what happened to me.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.697 align:middle line:84%
And you can bet it
caused tremendous growth

00:56:39.697 --> 00:56:41.265 align:middle line:90%
in my immediate family.

00:56:41.265 --> 00:56:42.266 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Yes.

00:56:42.266 --> 00:56:43.267 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: And it's often
in directions

00:56:43.267 --> 00:56:45.269 align:middle line:84%
that are not necessarily
what you predict

00:56:45.269 --> 00:56:49.006 align:middle line:84%
but it has opened all of
us to a much richer knowing

00:56:49.006 --> 00:56:52.443 align:middle line:84%
of our soul's true
calling realizing

00:56:52.443 --> 00:56:54.578 align:middle line:84%
that our souls are
eternal, that we're here

00:56:54.578 --> 00:56:56.981 align:middle line:84%
to learn lessons
and teach lessons.

00:56:56.981 --> 00:57:00.451 align:middle line:84%
>> LG: I am so glad
personally that you came back

00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:01.785 align:middle line:90%
to tell this whole story

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:04.255 align:middle line:84%
and to bridge this gap
for so many people.

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:07.258 align:middle line:84%
And the book is a very, very
wonderful, very quick read,

00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:10.528 align:middle line:84%
gripping stories in the
beginning and I wish you

00:57:10.528 --> 00:57:12.496 align:middle line:84%
to come back and tell
us what's next for you

00:57:12.496 --> 00:57:15.266 align:middle line:84%
because I'm pretty sure
you're up to big things.

00:57:15.266 --> 00:57:16.567 align:middle line:84%
>> EA: Well, thank
you very much.

00:57:16.567 --> 00:57:19.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just a real joy to be
here and I love that there's

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:23.941 align:middle line:84%
such an active community our
there, people who are wanting

00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:27.678 align:middle line:84%
to know more about the truth
not buying into, you know,

00:57:27.678 --> 00:57:31.882 align:middle line:84%
the standard stale dogma
from the scientific world,

00:57:31.882 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:84%
from the religious world, there
is a much richer understanding

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.689 align:middle line:84%
of all of this it
brings it all together.

00:57:38.689 --> 00:57:39.924 align:middle line:90%
>> LG: Absolutely.

00:57:39.924 --> 00:57:42.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge community
growing every single minute

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:47.298 align:middle line:84%
and these types of opportunities
just give that community a space

00:57:47.298 --> 00:57:48.999 align:middle line:90%
to say, "Hey, we're not alone."

00:57:48.999 --> 00:57:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> EA: Right.

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.601 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.
