00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to our Los
Angeles studio.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
The 1998 Oscar award-winning
film "What Dreams May Come,"

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:84%
starring Robin Williams
and Cuba Gooding,

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Jr. was a movie that
was so far ahead

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of its time in vision
and creativity.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And so is the film's
producer, Barnet Bain,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
who is joining us today.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Barnet is a creative
visionary and

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:90%
a transformational producer.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
He speaks all around the world
to corporations and individuals

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:84%
about creativity
and spirituality.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And he has blessed us
today with his presence.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.539 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being here, Barnet Bain.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNET BAIN: Thank you.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I am so glad to
be here with you.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Honestly,
the honor is mine.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
You have such an
incredible visionary eye.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And I know you as
a friend, as well.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Once I saw you at
just a conference.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And you were looking
behind the video camera.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:84%
You just got up out of you
seat, an you just looked

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.439 align:middle line:90%
behind the video camera.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking
at lifetimes of you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:84%
with the glasses
looking behind the lens.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.792 align:middle line:84%
You have a true talent and a
knack for visual production.

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Well, fortunately
that conference

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about we were

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:84%
amongst our very
dearest friends.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.845 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, that might have been
considered annoying, I think.

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You had
freedom to be yourself.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: Yeah.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.256 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, so now tell me
about where did you grow up?

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: I was raised in a small
French Canadian town 70 miles

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
north of Montreal in
Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Quebec.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.866 align:middle line:84%
My father was the local butcher,
and my mom was a housewife.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were you really
highly creative as a child?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.742 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: I think we're all
highly creative as children.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:90%
It gets shoehorned out of us.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I have an image of this
huge, huge creative potential

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that we all have, that
we all come in with.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like
we're shoehorned

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:84%
into a very, very
tight fit with life.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
We lose it as a result of
other people's thoughts,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and other people's
entertainment, and religions,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and television shows, and songs,
and education, and values,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
and world view.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon
there's not a lot

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
of welcoming for what we're
bringing to the table.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
We're trying so
desperately to fit in

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and to behave nicely
that our freedoms

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:84%
to create and to express
get reduced, and reduced,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.010 align:middle line:90%
and reduced.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I call it a structured
imagination.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did that ever happen to
you, that structure happened--

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: It sure did.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It did?

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.683 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: It sure did.

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:03.617 align:middle line:90%
It sure did.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
didn't get conditioned

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:90%
by-- well, that's a great point.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.685 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of those
social media outlets

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and everything else that we
have around us provides us

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:84%
with the visual
pictures that we are not

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
creating our own back to the
days where there was no TV.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And you get to create
your imagination.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Your imagination
creates pictures

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:90%
that are not even in books.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: We get structured
more now than ever before,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
but there's a flip
side to it, as well.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:84%
There's gold as a treasure
inside of that, as well,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:84%
because just as our imaginations
are structured by exposure

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to so much input, similarly
on the way out when we realize

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that, we have developed such
a capacity to create imagery

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and to have an
understanding of psychology.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And we have such a
fertile experience

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to draw from that when
we do get the picture,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and we can light the fuse to
escape that structured reality,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:90%
we really blast off.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's kind of
what you have done in a sense

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
because you have, in
the past, expressed

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:84%
your creativity through
film producing, television

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:90%
producing.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.117 align:middle line:90%
How do you choose your projects?

00:04:20.117 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me just back up?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
How did you get into that
from the butcher's son

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to coming to Hollywood and
becoming a film producer?

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: Well, there's two parts.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.678 align:middle line:84%
There's two ways to
answer that question.

00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And the first is I had dreams.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that desire,
and dreaming, and expectation,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
imagining, those are the
big raw materials out

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:90%
of which we create lives.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I had not been
shoehorned into that structure

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
sufficiently where I
abandoned all dreams.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
I still had dreams.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And I went off to college
after high school.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't do well.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I went from a town
of 3,000 people

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.320 align:middle line:84%
to a somewhat bigger
town in Ottawa, Canada.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I went wild, and
played, and partied.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And I flunked out of my first
year of college two years

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:90%
in a row.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: And went off to
Europe, and something

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:84%
in the escape from the
community of my upbringing

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to make different
kinds of choices, choices

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that maybe I wouldn't have
felt as comfortable making

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:90%
in my own community.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So I began to think of art,
and filmmaking, and photography

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
as a credible
career choice, which

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
would have been so far a
field in the community that I

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:90%
was raised in.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So the chance crossing of
those two things-- well,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend that
used to say that life

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is what happens when
you're making other plans.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.616 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: And so I
thought I was going

00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to go in a particular
direction, and the direction

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that I was socialized to go,
not quite in the butcher shop,

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
but a more conventional
profession.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.546 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Filmmaking
is a conventional--

00:06:28.546 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: And instead, I
went into filmmaking,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
which was such an
unconventional profession.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So these things kind of, they
just sort of happen, life

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:90%
happens, and you just dream.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you did
follow your dreams a lot.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.309 align:middle line:84%
What was the dream
that you were having?

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, specifically, was
there a specific dream,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.342 align:middle line:90%
or was it a series of--

00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: I dreamed of freedom.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hold it that way.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really understand it in
that way, but when I look back

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and when in meditation, for
instance, when I spend time

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
with myself at earlier times
in my life, which I do daily

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
sometimes more than
once, I am very

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
intimate with those
past versions of myself.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And he did not really have
the courage or the support

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to have big dreams, but
longed for the freedom.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Just didn't know how to
put his finger on why

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:84%
life felt so tense,
why he felt such

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
a pressure to conform and to
be a part of the community

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
in the very rigid ways
the community held itself.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So I knew then that
that desire to be free

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
was a light that was
burning very, very bright.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And it happened to show
up in a lot of ways,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.975 align:middle line:84%
including well, I'll do what
would have been considered

00:07:52.975 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
a Bohemian life, and
I'll do photography,

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and I'll start writing,
and I'll dabble in film.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually that
became a passionate interest

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
in spirituality, and
consciousness, in metaphysics.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not just anyone
makes it in the film industry

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and then maintains
the integrity that you

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:90%
have within the industry.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And it is your different
perspectives on life

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
that you bring to
your profession

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that I think has allowed you to
have longevity that you've had

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and also to continue on, even
with the different direction

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:84%
with lecturing on creativity
and consciousness.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.795 align:middle line:84%
What enables you to hold on
to that aspect of your life

00:08:39.795 --> 00:08:48.246 align:middle line:84%
of semi-sanity, of creativity,
of consciousness in the world?

00:08:48.246 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Small question.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Well, it's
a great question.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.256 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:08:51.256 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, I ask
it of myself constantly.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:90%
I am in love.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:90%
I am in love with spirituality.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.255 align:middle line:84%
I am in love with discovering
more and more of who I am,

00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
who I really am, and more
and more of who we all

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
are in relationship
to each other.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I have always
felt the pull of that.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
pieces come together

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:84%
like little pieces dropping
into a jigsaw puzzle.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Once upon a time,
the idea that we

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
are separate and yet
connected was an abstraction.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel it,
I experience it.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in love with it.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's so generous with me.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Even when it's difficult, I
always just get enough love--

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.276 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, wonderful.

00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: --to keep
me on the hunt.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:90%
I call it the big hunt.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And so there's nothing
really I can do.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
time in my past when

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
seduced off of it.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Many do get seduced.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: A huge hit, a
huge business success,

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
a huge film hit-- that kind
of thing when I look back

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:84%
may well have
seduced me off of it.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
sort of protections

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:84%
that I built into the place
because it's so clear to me

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.910 align:middle line:84%
that the choice that I
made in this lifetime

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
was to come home to the
love and to find and explore

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.507 align:middle line:90%
what really matters.

00:10:29.507 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you talking
about that hit being

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:90%
"What Dreams May Come?"

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: No, I'm talking about
anything that would have been

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:90%
such an enormous--

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: --have such an enormous
impact that it might have

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
changed my life so dramatically
in terms of how the world

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:90%
measures success--

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: --that it
might have moved me off

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:90%
of the trail of my life.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:90%
So those were the earlier years.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.594 align:middle line:84%
And now, as you were saying,
what keeps you at this?

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:03.177 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:11:03.177 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Never say
never, but there

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
is no seduction that is
going to turn me away

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
from a path that has been
so beautiful, and magical,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:90%
and generous.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:90%
So I've matured into it.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.884 align:middle line:84%
And that's the best answer that
I can come to, and I just--

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:25.384 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful answer.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.143 align:middle line:90%
That's a beautiful answer.

00:11:27.143 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Did you go through periods
of studying meditation

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.940 align:middle line:84%
or of long journeys
within a certain type

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:84%
of a teacher or a journey in
your life prior to filmmaking?

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Prior to
filmmaking, absolutely.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
When I was very little,
I lived in this town

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about of 3,000
people, French Canadian town.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was a tourist
town, so in the winter

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:84%
there was nobody in the
town except on weekends

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:90%
because it was a ski town.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So we'd go from 3,000 to
like 6,000 on the weekends

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:90%
when the snow was on the ground.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the summer, it would
go to 40,000 or 50,000.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:84%
There were people that had
little summer cottages.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a small
French Canadian town.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
My ethnicity and religious
background is Jewish.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And I lived in a town that
had like 10 Jewish families--

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:90%
--but there was a synagogue.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And the synagogue was there
because in the summer time

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.490 align:middle line:84%
there were all these
people to fill it.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, at one point when
I was very young, even then

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I latched on to
the call of spirit.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.014 align:middle line:84%
And I thought then that I
was going to be a rabbi.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.085 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: So, yes, this
is a very, very long--

00:12:47.085 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Long journey for you.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.638 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: --long journey.

00:12:48.638 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And the first film that I
was ever involved in was-- I

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.490 align:middle line:84%
wrote "The Jesus Film,"
which if you Google it,

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
it's the most widely
seen film on the planet.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And so even when I didn't
know I was wandering,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I have never wandered too
far off the soft shoulder

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.777 align:middle line:90%
on either side of the road.

00:13:12.777 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when the
script came to you

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:84%
of "What Dreams may
Come," did you immediately

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
resonate with that
film as being something

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that you thought was going to
express your inner feeling?

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: At the time
that that script came,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I was partnered with a
gentleman named Stephen Simon.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And Stephen had
developed that script.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:84%
He had developed it
for many, many years.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And we partnered up,
and the first time

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.546 align:middle line:90%
that I saw that movie, I cried.

00:13:41.546 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: I still get choked up.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I cried because I thought
oh my goodness, this

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
has given expression to a more
of what matters to me that I

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:84%
hold as beautiful, and
good, and true than anything

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.047 align:middle line:90%
that I have experienced in film.

00:14:05.047 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just when
you read the script?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Just when
I read the script.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.243 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it popped
off the page instantly.

00:14:09.243 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: And so I
thought what a miracle.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was a gift
from Stephen to me.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a
look at this actually.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.801 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of clips
that we have around the movie

00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that you have found
some beautiful teaching

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:90%
moments within.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's really one
of my favorite movies.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of my favorite
scenes from the movie.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.986 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:14:30.986 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS: Nice
place you got here.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.568 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:14:33.568 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Nice place you got here.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: Me?

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: Sure!

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.440 align:middle line:90%
You're making all of this.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
See, we're all pretty
insecure at first,

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.052 align:middle line:84%
so we see ourself
somewhere safe, comforting.

00:14:44.052 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
We all paint our own
surroundings, Chris,

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.064 align:middle line:84%
but you're the first guy
I know to use real paint.

00:14:49.064 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS: There is
so much here she

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:90%
didn't paint, like that bird.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERT: And it
gave you a start,

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
sort of like holding
on to hand rails.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Now you're creating
an entire world here

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:84%
from your imagination,
from paintings

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:90%
you love, anything you want.

>>CHRIS: Why doesn't it move?

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERT: It'll move
when you want it to.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:90%

You go boy!

00:15:20.274 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: Can I make it dive?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.925 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERT: You're
the painter now.

00:15:22.925 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:90%
It's your world!

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.208 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: Yeaaaaah aha!

00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:27.833 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: Whoo!

00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:29.312 align:middle line:90%
Hahahaha.

00:15:29.312 --> 00:15:30.298 align:middle line:90%
Look at it go.

00:15:30.298 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Whoo!

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.982 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS: How about
maybe turquoise wings?

00:15:33.982 --> 00:15:35.866 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERT: Turquoise
in the house!

00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:84%

mauve, all right.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.515 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: Whoo hoo hoo!

00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:41.098 align:middle line:90%

00:15:41.098 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:90%

our own realities in
certain ways, right?

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Yeah, to me,
it's a documentary.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A documentary?

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Cuba says, "We all
create our own reality.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You're just the first
one to use real paint."

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.770 align:middle line:84%
In this clip, he's
creating in a dream.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
dream, it happens

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:90%
to be an afterlife dream.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
He's passed on.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But who's to say
that that is not

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:90%
how we generate all of this.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have an
inkling that it is.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not-- I'm just saying.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.984 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it makes
sense in every level.

00:16:46.984 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Scientific level, whatever--

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: At every level.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways
that we do it.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So, as we said before,
there are raw materials

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:84%
which are desire, and
expectation, and imagination.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
And we work on those raw
materials in the same way

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that a painter uses
colors or a sculptor

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:90%
uses a chisel on marble.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
We chisel away at those raw
materials with some tools.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And those tools are our
beliefs, and our thoughts,

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and our choices,
and our decisions,

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and our attitudes,
and our feelings.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:30.283 align:middle line:84%
And the interplay between
those shows up on the,

00:17:30.283 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:90%
I call it the holodeck.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.227 align:middle line:90%
It's like the--

00:17:34.227 --> 00:17:34.935 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Holodeck.

00:17:34.935 --> 00:17:35.893 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: --the holodeck.

00:17:35.893 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:90%
We are walking--

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:37.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --holographic--

00:17:37.245 --> 00:17:38.661 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: --the
holographic reality.

00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
We're literally moving with
a deeper and deeper and more

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and more intimate awareness
of that process is happening

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
all the time, certainly for
our listeners here today.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They are committed
to this exploration.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And so what is
happening here is we

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
are very consciously becoming
intimate with our subconscious.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:84%
We are walking through our
subconscious all the time.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, just
as he had painted

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
the bird a different
color, we do that when

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:84%
we make a conscious
choice to take

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.987 align:middle line:84%
a different direction
in our life.

00:18:12.987 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: We do that when
we make a conscious choice

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:90%
to take a different direction.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
We do that when we
shift an emotional state

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:84%
from feeling helpless,
or hopeless, or anxious,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
or unappreciated,
or happy, glad, sad.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Every shift changes
the frequency game.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And no thought, or action,
or feeling, or belief

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:90%
goes in ernest.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
ripples across eternity.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And when
you made a choice

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to start going into
corporations and lecturing

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.332 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness,
how did that happen?

00:18:50.332 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:84%
How did that paintbrush
direction happen?

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.331 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: I was actually invited.

00:18:53.331 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.203 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: That's how it showed up.

00:18:55.203 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I used to think that
seeing is believing,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:90%
and that cause leads to effect.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:90%
And I don't hold that anymore.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It's true, but there's a
overarching, a superseding way

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.810 align:middle line:90%
that reality works, as well.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
well, effects lead to causes.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And because I had
a tremendous desire

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to reach out to corporations
and to work not just

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
in the entertainment business
as much as I love it,

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:84%
but with schools, and educators,
and with corporations,

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
because I had such
a desire for it,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:84%
at some point energy follows
attention, it manifested.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So effects lead to
causes in a more real way

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:90%
than causes lead to effects.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: I held that intention.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I often imagined
how that would work,

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
and I did it quite consciously.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And then one day someone who was
working for a big corporation--

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.625 align:middle line:84%
they're actually the company
that is putting the XL

00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
pipeline-- building the XL
pipeline-- somebody asked

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:84%
if I would come
and work with them.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Work with
them on creativity?

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Work with them on
creativity, and innovation,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and aligning inside
their divisions,

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.610 align:middle line:84%
aligning some of the
teams so that everybody

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:90%
was holding the same story.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were really,
really wonderful.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.839 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: Really wonderful.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So I operate from a passionate
relationship with creativity.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And I am convinced
that right now business

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
is the primary area of
creativity on the planet.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, in my opinion,
it needs the most creativity

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:84%
at this point because we are
having to reinvent ourselves

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:90%
in business across the board.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.686 align:middle line:84%
And even there is an
increase in entrepreneurs.

00:21:01.686 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And entrepreneurs
are constantly having

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to reinvent themselves, which
is another definite need

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:90%
for creativity.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:90%
So how do you bridge that gap?

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.365 align:middle line:84%
How do you take a
corporation or even

00:21:12.365 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:84%
an individual out of the mold
that isn't working any longer?

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Well, very
briefly, we refer

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:84%
to how realities
are created, belief,

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
thought, choice, decision,
actions, and feelings,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and working upon imagination,
and expectations.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is also how
corporations operate.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.990 align:middle line:84%
They aren't as conscious
about it in that way.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they are.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.337 align:middle line:84%
They don't hold it in the
language of metaphysics--

00:21:43.337 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: --that we do.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.103 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:45.103 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: But they absolutely
have mission statements,

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and they have vision
plans, and they

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
have goals quarterly, and
annually, and long-term.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So they are very,
very much in alignment

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:90%
with these principles.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And they have the same kinds
of challenges that we have,

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
which are getting
our espoused values

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:90%
in line with our actual values.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And as someone who has spent
many years studying what goes

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:84%
unsaid, whether it's
the making of a film.

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:84%
What is powerful in a
scene, like the scene

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:84%
that you just saw,
is not the words

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.597 align:middle line:84%
that come out but the 97%
of all communication that

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:90%
is non-verbal.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:84%
That is where the
real messages lie.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
In films, that's called subtext.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: And in life, it's called
subconscious communications.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can string
together any words

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
from a script or any
communication in your office,

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
or in your home, or
in your car pool.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It is not the words that
carries the communication,

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:84%
but is the mysterious thread
that strings them together that

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
has to do with your intent,
and where are you coming from,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and what is it that you want
the other person to do or say.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:84%
That is not in the
words, but that

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:90%
is what makes a performance.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can do
Shakespeare 10 zillion times,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.803 align:middle line:90%
and it's always different.

00:23:17.803 --> 00:23:21.196 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is in
every communication .

00:23:21.196 --> 00:23:22.696 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The energetic
essence of it.

00:23:22.696 --> 00:23:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: The energetic essence,
and what is your real agenda?

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I could say Lisa, it's so great
to be here with you today.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I can also say it
passive aggressively.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I can also say it impatiently.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I can also say it-- so
more often than not,

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
we are not aware of the
real communication that

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:45.420 align:middle line:84%
underlies what we are
sharing with others.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual path
includes draining the water out

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.180 align:middle line:84%
of the tub so that we see what's
down there so we understand

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:84%
what our beliefs are and
what our intentions are.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And that holds true, as
well, in corporations.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So I work with them in that way
so that they have x-ray glasses

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:90%
on, x-ray vision.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And they can more clearly
have an understanding

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:15.999 align:middle line:84%
of where they're coming
from, and how others

00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:84%
are communicating
with them, and what

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.455 align:middle line:84%
it is they're really
saying and visioning.

00:24:19.455 --> 00:24:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I really appreciate
that you don't bring it

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:84%
to a new-age level
or metaphysical.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:84%
You keep it to a level that
a corporation can hear.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a
Fortune 500 company

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:84%
or a multi-billion
dollar corporation,

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:90%
they can hear this language.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you really look at it,
a mission statement, a vision

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:43.181 align:middle line:84%
statement, bylaws could be the
creative backbone of a company.

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: And it is.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every great
company has their version

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:90%
of a vision board--

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Through the
vision statement, right?

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.366 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: --through the
vision statement--

00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:55.001 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:24:55.001 --> 00:25:00.005 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: --through their
goals, through their reports,

00:25:00.005 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:90%
through their direct reports.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They just
don't see it that way.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.801 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: They have
accountability practices.

00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't see it that
way, and sometimes they do.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
the same kinds of tools

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:15.081 align:middle line:84%
to add to their considerable
toolkit, the tools of being

00:25:15.081 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
accountable, and processing,
and getting in alignment,

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and understanding so everybody
is playing from not just

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
the same script, but
from the same subtext.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's critical.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for noticing,
for noticing that I really

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.970 align:middle line:84%
make it a point to try
and demystify this stuff.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:90%
I have like a zero jargon plan.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No tolerance, huh?

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: No because I find
I'll get into a habit

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
where I start using phrases, and
it becomes a shorthand for me,

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:90%
and pretty soon it's brittle.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.367 align:middle line:90%
There's no juiciness left it in.

00:25:58.367 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it wasn't
yours or-- yeah.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.741 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Yeah, and often
it's not even mine.

00:26:01.741 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's like hand me down
somebody else's experience,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just parrotting it.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not
from my experience,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.172 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be very hard
to generously share it

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:14.755 align:middle line:90%
with somebody.

00:26:14.755 --> 00:26:16.629 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love that you
said that because one

00:26:16.629 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:84%
of the most incredible
essences I get from you

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:90%
is your authenticity.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:84%
You are so true and
impeccable with your word.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
You really do live out
that fourth agreement

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.547 align:middle line:90%
from Don Miguel Ruiz.

00:26:28.547 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: From Miguel.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --yes-- is because you
are impeccable with your word.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:84%
You're careful
about what you say.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:90%
You're intentional.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't throw
statements out there just

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.510 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of having
a colloquialism.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
You are very truly
intentional, which I love.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And I see that in the choices
that you make of teaching,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:84%
or if it's
filmmaking, or if it's

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
the-- you have a radio show,
which I didn't mention earlier,

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:84%
"Cutting Edge Consciousness,"
which I also love.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Which you
were a guest on.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.102 align:middle line:90%
You were wonderful.

00:26:57.102 --> 00:26:57.601 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:57.601 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And you do incredible
things like that.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:04.160 align:middle line:84%
You brought visual to something
that's audio, which who knew?

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.245 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: Visual radio.

00:27:05.245 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Visual radio.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:06.840 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.386 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: It's not radio,
and it's not TV, right?

00:27:08.386 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is it?

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.345 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's visual radio.

00:27:09.345 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: We'll figure it out.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Again,
you're a visionary.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a look
back at the film,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:84%
"What Dreams May Come" because
this is another great clip.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.347 align:middle line:84%
And you use these
clips within your--

00:27:18.347 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: I do..

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --lectures and so forth
on spirituality, essentially.

00:27:22.915 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:90%
This is what this is.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.674 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:27:24.674 --> 00:27:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERT: Let's
take the shortcut.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:31.832 align:middle line:90%


00:27:31.832 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: Nice shortcut.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: It's easy, Chris.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.377 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: I'm gonna drowned.

00:27:36.377 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: You can't.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.425 align:middle line:90%
You're already dead.

00:27:39.425 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: Oh.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.956 align:middle line:90%
Am I-- am I really here?

00:27:42.956 --> 00:27:44.905 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERT: What do you
mean by you anyway?

00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Are you your arm or your leg?

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: Hardly.

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:49.576 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: Really?

00:27:49.576 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:84%
If you lost all your limbs,
wouldn't you still be you?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: I'd still be me.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: So what is the me?

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHRIS: My brain, I suppose.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERT: Your brain?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is a body part, like
your fingernail or your heart.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.886 align:middle line:90%
Why is that the part that's you?

00:28:05.886 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS: Because I--
it's sort of a voice

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.140 align:middle line:84%
in my head, the part of me
that thinks, that feels,

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that is aware that
I exist at all.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:24.245 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERT: So if you're aware
you exist, then you do.

00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:26.160 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're still here.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in this
clip, the film

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:84%
is talking about,
essentially, consciousness.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Consciousness,
are you your body?

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're not your body, if
you keep cutting it away,

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:43.550 align:middle line:84%
you're not this,
then who are you?

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of the
incredible things

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.190 align:middle line:84%
that I got from this movie is
a life-changing moment for me,

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:84%
one of those transformational
films that changes your life.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And after I saw "What
Dreams May Come,"

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I set up agreements with
the loved ones in my life

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.000 align:middle line:84%
on how to communicate with
them in the afterlife.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And my mom and I are going to
communicate through clouds,

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and my husband and I
are going to communicate

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.558 align:middle line:84%
through a certain way, and my
daughter and I are going to--

00:29:08.558 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and we have this
agreement in this lifetime

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to transfer the
relationship after our bodies

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are gone because this film made
such an impact on me of what

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:90%
it means to be consciousness.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And the limbs, and the
legs, and all of that

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:84%
are vehicles that
we're in right now.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And we get these vehicles
to be able to do this,

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:90%
to communicate, it's great.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But we can also communicate
on another level.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And that has changed
my relationships

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.450 align:middle line:90%
with all of my loved ones.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:43.815 align:middle line:84%
So I know how to keep in contact
with them if one of our bodies

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:90%
is to disappear for any reason.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.864 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just one person who
was affected by that film.

00:29:50.864 --> 00:29:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that you've
heard so many other things,

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:84%
but how do we lose our
creativity in relationships?

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.707 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.707 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: We start to
play it by a rote.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I believe that
there are only relationships.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.842 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Mmm, well,
that's interesting.

00:30:05.842 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.763 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: So I'm
assuming you're talking

00:30:07.763 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:84%
about primary relationships,
loving relationships,

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:90%
committed relationships?

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: So the same holds true
for committed relationships,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:84%
but to a degree that is much
more impeccable and much more

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:21.780 align:middle line:90%
responsible.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:84%
By that, I don't mean the burden
or obligation, but the ability

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:84%
to rise in response to
whatever challenges come up.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:90%
It's such a glorious ability.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:33.467 align:middle line:90%
It's such a gift.

00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Some call it resilience.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Some call it resilience,
and some call it just

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
the most wonderful,
gracious gift.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So when we begin to
take it for granted,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:52.220 align:middle line:84%
or if we're not growing,
if we're not actively

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:84%
expanding the frontier of
what it means to be loving,

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to see another person, and to
see ourselves with patience,

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.530 align:middle line:84%
with compassion-- OK,
well that's the way

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I was yesterday or last week.

>>LISA: So in this clip, he
went back into the dream state

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:45.207 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with her?

00:39:45.207 --> 00:39:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that what he was doing?

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: He went
into his own story.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.380 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.950 align:middle line:90%
She had lost her children.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:90%
They'd both lost their children.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And she had such grief,
and he walled himself off

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and went into denial
because he had

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:84%
a story that he
needed to be strong.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And so she had nobody
to share that grief.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.360 align:middle line:84%
She had this power
in the telling,

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.660 align:middle line:90%
and she was even more alienated.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.820 align:middle line:84%
She had her grief, and
she had the loneliness

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.370 align:middle line:84%
of not being able to communicate
with him and share it.

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And so she ended up having
to go to this asylum.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.507 align:middle line:84%
She had a nervous breakdown,
and he comes and visits her

00:40:28.507 --> 00:40:29.090 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.750 align:middle line:90%
And he has this ticket.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And he says this
is a decision day.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.820 align:middle line:84%
This is a one-way ticket
decision about divorce.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:90%
So it says it's a d day.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:84%
She says well, that
would be double d day.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
having a conversation

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:90%
about what really went on.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's realizing he left her
to do all the heavy lifting

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.470 align:middle line:84%
around the emotions and that
he was protecting himself

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:90%
not feeling anything.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, the beauty of this
is that when we're inside

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.980 align:middle line:84%
our bubble, our stories,
the way we hold life,

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:84%
we're so identified with it,
it's very difficult to change.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a fish in water.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But when that fish flings
itself up on the river bank,

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.416 align:middle line:90%
it can then look back and say--

00:41:14.416 --> 00:41:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's water.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: --I came out of water.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's what is
happening here.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.630 align:middle line:90%
He gives it a name.

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:22.302 align:middle line:90%
They call it double d.

00:41:22.302 --> 00:41:27.325 align:middle line:84%
And now they can begin
to relate to that story

00:41:27.325 --> 00:41:29.030 align:middle line:84%
rather than be
identified with it.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, the
door to freedom swings open.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do we do
that in our own lives?

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Well, how many times--
I'll speak personally--

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:84%
things that I hold,
somebody disappointed me,

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:84%
or I have a great thing
that I'm going on right now.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a number of work
relationships mostly

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that have certain
accountabilities to me.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And about five of them
are out of integrity

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.520 align:middle line:90%
around their accountability.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.667 align:middle line:84%
So now there is only one common
denominator in these five.

00:42:11.667 --> 00:42:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That would be you.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.291 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: So it'd be
really easy for me

00:42:14.291 --> 00:42:18.590 align:middle line:84%
to get very caught up in
the righteous indignation

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.250 align:middle line:90%
or in the wagging finger.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is this
is five of these things,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
accountable to me.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is a mirror about
how I hold accountability

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.930 align:middle line:90%
and what my expectations are.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So when I can see
that, I am calling it

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.016 align:middle line:90%
my accountability story.

00:42:39.016 --> 00:42:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Before I can really
have an effective communication

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.350 align:middle line:84%
with these people, I'm
naming it I have a story,

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and it should be like this,
and it should be like this,

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.965 align:middle line:90%
and it should be like this.

00:42:51.965 --> 00:42:53.300 align:middle line:90%
And oh poor me.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm calling that all
my accountability story,

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and now I'm examining it.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And so because I'm
not inside of it,

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just doing my knee jerk
habituated brittle responses.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: But I can begin to
have a process with myself,

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and free up some energy, and
look at what is going on here.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.780 align:middle line:84%
What might be some of
the elements in here

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that would lead me to create
this repetitive pattern where

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.095 align:middle line:84%
I have an opportunity
to be a victim?

00:43:27.095 --> 00:43:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's so interesting
because this whole interview

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about
your accountability

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.340 align:middle line:90%
and authenticity.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
know about that.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.600 align:middle line:84%
It just actually shows
that you are that way,

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and that we do get stuck
inside of our story,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and that we form our own
stories around things.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Just as easily as we form
it, can we unform it?

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Like what are you going to do?

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.470 align:middle line:90%
You've looked at that.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.680 align:middle line:84%
You've stepped outside
of your story now.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.420 align:middle line:90%
What changes?

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: I am making a
friend of uncertainty

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.630 align:middle line:84%
because I would really love
to just have the answers.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.664 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
creative in that.

00:44:00.664 --> 00:44:01.705 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Have it complete.

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:02.205 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: Yes.

00:44:02.205 --> 00:44:04.653 align:middle line:84%
Can it just be complete
because I'm uncomfortable?

00:44:04.653 --> 00:44:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: So I am watching
my discomfort as much

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.540 align:middle line:84%
as I can because it
is not my default

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:84%
way of operating in
the world is to feel.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So I am feeling as much
as I can the discomfort,

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not running from it, and I'm
allowing what comes up in its

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:32.920 align:middle line:84%
own cadence and its own timing
to come up before I go back

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and instead of having the
conversation that I would have

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.940 align:middle line:84%
had, which would have been
probably not pretty and not

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%

for--and I don't know what.

I don't have an answer here.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't have an answer, but I'm
waiting for something creative

00:44:55.870 --> 00:45:02.280 align:middle line:84%
to emerge in me that allows me
to be more responsible for what

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:84%
is going on than I would
have been if I just went off

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.839 align:middle line:84%
unprepared at the limit of
my potential to be prepared.

00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:13.130 align:middle line:90%

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:14.050 align:middle line:84%

new ground for me.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.010 align:middle line:90%

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:15.926 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is great.

00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:18.140 align:middle line:84%
No, but this is how you
are experiencing it.

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.190 align:middle line:90%
And this is being creative.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: This is being creative.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Creativity happens in the heart.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.830 align:middle line:84%
It happens in a space
behind the heart.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.880 align:middle line:84%
That is the portal through
which we experience

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.350 align:middle line:90%
what is innovative and creative.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Then kicks in this
magnificent inner-engineer

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:45.740 align:middle line:84%
strategic technician, the doer,
the integrated masculine energy

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that fills the space and
creates form out of function.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.890 align:middle line:84%
That's beautiful, but when we
are estranged from this part,

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:57.370 align:middle line:84%
it can go off and
sometimes be a mania.

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're
just doing, doing, doing,

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's unrelated to
making the context bigger,

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and making the context new,
and making the context fresh.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
between the doing

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and the being state,
in between those

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.835 align:middle line:84%
is birthed some
kind of revelation.

00:46:16.835 --> 00:46:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
what, reinvention?

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.045 align:middle line:90%
That's what--

00:46:19.045 --> 00:46:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: That's reinvention.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:21.100 align:middle line:90%
That's innovation.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.060 align:middle line:90%
That's where the juicy stuff is.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's where
creativity comes.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So, as I said earlier, you
choose scripts and stories

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.610 align:middle line:84%
based on your emotions
and feelings around them.

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:33.720 align:middle line:84%
There's another film
that you showed me,

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.000 align:middle line:90%
which I think is wonderful.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.130 align:middle line:84%
It's called from
"Homeless to Harvard."

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.180 align:middle line:84%
How did you come
across this story?

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: This is
a while back now.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.410 align:middle line:90%
I was in my agent's office.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And he got up to do something
outside of the room.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And that would be my
cue to actually see

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.320 align:middle line:84%
what might be
interesting in here.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And I found this
thing on the floor.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:05.454 align:middle line:84%
And it was an interview
between Liz Murray

00:47:05.454 --> 00:47:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and I think with Barbara
Walters, or something

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.870 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.092 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated by
it, "Homeless to Harvard."

00:47:10.092 --> 00:47:11.300 align:middle line:90%
I thought that's interesting.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And when he came back
in, I asked him about it.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And he told me it
was a true story

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:20.970 align:middle line:84%
of Liz Murray, a young
girl whose parents were

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:24.590 align:middle line:84%
both drug addicted and
had AIDS in the Bronx.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And the mother passed
away, and the young girl

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.560 align:middle line:84%
ended up on the streets and
realized her only way out

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:84%
was going to be to have a
zero tolerance for self-pity

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.300 align:middle line:90%
and to apply herself.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.185 align:middle line:90%
And she--

00:47:38.185 --> 00:47:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A true story?

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:39.934 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: --true story.

00:47:39.934 --> 00:47:42.780 align:middle line:84%
She went through four years
of college and two years

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.860 align:middle line:84%
living on the subway and
eating out of dumpsters.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And she earned a
scholarship to Harvard.

00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And she is a hero
of mine, a shero.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.907 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A shero?

00:47:53.907 --> 00:47:55.490 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a
clip of this, which

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:59.200 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful-- I'm amazed
that this is a true story,

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.360 align:middle line:90%
and she did this.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.671 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:48:01.671 --> 00:48:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE SPEAKER: She
did it while homeless.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Her mother dead, her
father a drug addict,

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.820 align:middle line:84%
living in shelters,
and any way I

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:11.010 align:middle line:84%
describe this can't do justice
to her accomplishments,

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:13.980 align:middle line:84%
so I'll just introduce to
you our sixth New York Times

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.674 align:middle line:90%
scholarship winner, Liz Murray.

00:48:16.674 --> 00:48:18.156 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LIZ: Everything's changed.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.320 align:middle line:90%
My life will never be the same.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what else
to say except for thank you.

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.750 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MALE SPEAKER: Liz?

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Liz?

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:43.980 align:middle line:90%
How'd you do this?

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LIZ: How could I not do it?

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.920 align:middle line:84%
My parents showed me
what the alternative was.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE SPEAKER: Didn't you
ever feel sorry for yourself?

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LIZ: Sorry?

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE SPEAKER:
Sleeping in subways,

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.270 align:middle line:90%
eating out of dumpsters?

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LIZ: That had always,
uh, been my life.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And I really-- I
feel that I got lucky

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:09.240 align:middle line:84%
because any sense of security
was pulled out from under me.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:90%
So I was forced to look forward.

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:11.920 align:middle line:90%
I had to.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.020 align:middle line:90%
There was no going back.

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And I reached a point where
I just thought, all right.

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna work as
hard as I possibly can

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:25.330 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.680 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm going to college.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.056 align:middle line:84%
And, uh, and the New York
Times is going to pay.

00:49:31.056 --> 00:49:32.014 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:49:32.014 --> 00:49:34.882 align:middle line:90%


00:49:34.882 --> 00:49:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE SPEAKER: So you
were lucky, but is there

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:44.275 align:middle line:84%
anything you'd change
if you were able?

00:49:44.275 --> 00:49:44.775 align:middle line:90%
>>LIZ: Yeah.

00:49:44.775 --> 00:49:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:59.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd give it back, all of it,
if I could have my family back.

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's amazing
how a minute long clip

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.550 align:middle line:90%
could make me cry.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:07.400 align:middle line:90%
It is such a powerful story.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And she stuck with
what she believed in

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.360 align:middle line:84%
even though she had no
reference in her life.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:18.180 align:middle line:84%
She was dealt a bad deck, and
she made the best out of it

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.220 align:middle line:84%
when she had to treat
her mother as her baby.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that really
broke the mold.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:28.020 align:middle line:84%
How do you teach people to
stick with what you believe in,

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.240 align:middle line:84%
to not go after the
shiny, bright whatever,

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.679 align:middle line:84%
and to stay true to
what you believe in?

00:50:33.679 --> 00:50:36.220 align:middle line:84%
In the projects you choose, and
the creativity that you have,

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships that
you have, how do you do that?

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.240 align:middle line:90%
You've done that.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: It's an ongoing process.

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:47.440 align:middle line:90%
And it has to do with values.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.037 align:middle line:84%
I map my values, and I
encourage other people

00:50:51.037 --> 00:50:51.870 align:middle line:90%
to map their values.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:53.203 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what does that mean?

00:50:53.203 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: --to be clear on what
I value, and what you value,

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.050 align:middle line:84%
we have certain kinds
of areas in our life.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:03.970 align:middle line:84%
There is my career life,
and my home and family life,

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and my spiritual life,
and my hobby life,

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and my recreational life,
my life around health.

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:90%
And so it's like a wheel.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And I grade them,
and I make sure

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that I am feeding
attention into,

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.650 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't go out of
balance so that I don't become

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:28.130 align:middle line:84%
a workaholic, or so that I
don't become somebody who's

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:32.760 align:middle line:84%
escaping life through
eating or whatever it is.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I do my best to
keep them modulated.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And because these
things are my values,

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and when I score
them on a 1 to 10,

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I can see where I
give more attention

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.900 align:middle line:90%
and where I give less attention.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.820 align:middle line:90%
And I try to balance them out.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.490 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:57.970 align:middle line:84%
When I know my values, I have
an opportunity to express

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:03.440 align:middle line:84%
character because one cannot
have character without having

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.870 align:middle line:90%
values.

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:10.354 align:middle line:84%
Character to me is the degree
to which I live by my values.

00:52:10.354 --> 00:52:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the same
thing, in essence?

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.394 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Well, if I'm living
in accordance with my values,

00:52:14.394 --> 00:52:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I have character.

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:17.970 align:middle line:84%
If I don't know
what my values are,

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:21.840 align:middle line:84%
then my character is
all over the place.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I have values, and my
values are always deepening,

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I will never ever achieve
perfect character.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:34.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's like the guiding star.

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:38.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a mission that is
bigger than this life,

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.810 align:middle line:90%
and it informs my choices.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So now it's very clear that
if I have an opportunity

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:51.940 align:middle line:84%
to take on a project or
to make a choice that

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:56.600 align:middle line:84%
is inconsistent with what my
values are, I absolutely know.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And I can't hide from myself.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:84%
You become very
honest with yourself.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:07.470 align:middle line:84%
But one has to know what are
the lines that I will not

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:84%
cross in the various areas
of my life in order for me

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:middle line:84%
to know whether
I'm crossing them.

this kind of discussion--

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:54.405 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

There have been and
there will continue

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:06.510 align:middle line:90%

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of them will be out
of alignment with my values.

00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it would be
out of character

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:16.050 align:middle line:90%
for me to accept them.

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will
be in alignment.

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
fun, if they allow

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.820 align:middle line:84%
me to bring to the table as
many of my gifts and talents

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.650 align:middle line:84%
as possible, and if they
are valuable to myself

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.020 align:middle line:84%

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Well, you framed it in
a way that I had never put it,

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:06.070 align:middle line:90%
and I love that.

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:07.232 align:middle line:90%
So I'll be using that.

00:55:07.232 --> 00:55:07.732 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:07.732 --> 00:55:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You put it there.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:84%
You have a radio show called
"Cutting Edge Consciousness,"

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:16.670 align:middle line:84%
which is a brilliant way
of taking online radio,

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:84%
moving it to a visual, and your
technology use is really great.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So I love that you've
combined those two together.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's with really, really
brilliant people bringing

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:30.920 align:middle line:84%
on great concepts and
inspiring conversations.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage people
to take a look at that.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.660 align:middle line:84%
How long have you
been doing that?

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: Two years, There's
200 hours up there now.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.250 align:middle line:90%
And do you feel that--

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: We have the most
fantastic, fantastic people.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.030 align:middle line:84%
For anybody who's
not local, they

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:51.290 align:middle line:84%
can get podcasts,
 www.cuttingedgeconsciousness.com.

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And do you see the
trend towards focused media

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:59.500 align:middle line:84%
being more of the
online aspects of media?

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BAIN: I do.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this is
not great news for me,

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and even worse news
for you in some ways.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean
I'm confident you

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:17.120 align:middle line:84%
are going to expand your
platform in myriad ways.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
radio-- well, you're FM.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So you have a much
bigger window.

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:24.460 align:middle line:90%
I am on AM.

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.121 align:middle line:84%
And the days of AM radio
are clearly numbered.

00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BAIN: So I believe
that there are automobile

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:35.750 align:middle line:84%
manufactures who, in
the next model year--

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Porsche is one of
them-- won't even

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.130 align:middle line:90%
have AM available in their cars.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So what is happening are
some of the gigantic media

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.940 align:middle line:84%
corporations are
assembling podcasters,

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and they are bundling them
into sort of collectives

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and selling advertising around
them, looking for best of breed

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.840 align:middle line:90%
in particular areas.

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.320 align:middle line:90%
And then they'll offer them up.

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be downloading
that in your cars and--

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, wow, membership
types of functionality.

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:10.730 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So many changes
that are happening,

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and they're happening
fast, so it's

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:18.980 align:middle line:84%
important to stay creative, to
constantly reinvent yourself,

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.200 align:middle line:84%
to use that creativity and
love in that reinvention.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.440 align:middle line:90%
You're a gem, a gem.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.732 align:middle line:90%
I think you're just awesome.
