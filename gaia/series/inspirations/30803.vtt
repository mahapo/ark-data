Don Diego Ruiz,
who is joining me

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:90%
here in studio in Los Angeles.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Welcome and thank

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's a great pleasure.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm very happy to
be here with you.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.441 align:middle line:10%
Today's a very
special day for me.

00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:05.463 align:middle line:10%
-It is?
-Oh, definitely.

00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:10%
For us, too.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, 11 years ago,
I have a major heart attack.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.777 align:middle line:84%
It's the 11 anniversary
of a heart attack.

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the anniversary
of your heart attack.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:90%
February 28, 2002.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Did you every think that
you'd be sitting here

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.595 align:middle line:90%
right now saying that to me?

00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know is-- everything
is about life really.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I am so grateful that
you are, by the way, here.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a big
excitement for me to go

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.462 align:middle line:90%
into that process of death.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I wake
up 4:00 in the morning

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
with that strong
pain in my heart

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:90%
with the sensation of death.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.766 align:middle line:84%
Then I knew, of course,
is a heart attack.

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:50.691 align:middle line:84%
And something that got in
my head is, this is it.

00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:53.651 align:middle line:84%
-It did?
-And I was so excited.

00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:90%
The pen is very--

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.316 align:middle line:90%
You were excited that this--

00:01:55.316 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the pen is really strong.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.775 align:middle line:84%
That I had the opportunity to
share with everyone how to die,

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:90%
how to celebrate death.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the moment
though, you had that pain.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Was that all going
through your head?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%
I was very excited.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.611 align:middle line:84%
I say, finally is
going to happen.

00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I been-- before I was
being a guy near dead before,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and I see my physical body
completely separated from me.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.305 align:middle line:90%
It was no longer a theory.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But this time it will
be the real thing.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Now before, when you had
the near death experience,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:90%
how many years before was that?

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was in my early 20s.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was in medical school.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And like any good doctor,
we were celebrating

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:90%
and I drink too much.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I was in Cuernavaca, a
place close to Mexico City.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And I make the wrong choice.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I decide to go back to Mexico
City because I have to work.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.922 align:middle line:84%
And well, I slept
on the way home

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:15.885 align:middle line:90%
and go directly a wall concrete.

00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:90%
You fell asleep at the wheel?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and the car was total.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But nothing happened
to my physical body.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I see my body
sleeping on the wheel.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And even more, I
protect my body.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Against the steering
wheel and everything.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
I protect my body.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And I had that memory
and I used to say,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:90%
no this is not possible.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:90%
I try to denied everything.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:90%
But no, there's no way to deny.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Before I knew that as a theory.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But after that I was
no longer a theory.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew that I am not my body.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
That's change
everything once again.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
This takes us back to
when you were a child

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and you were raised in
the Toltec tradition.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:90%
And where were you raised?

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was grew up in Tijuana
with my parents, my grandfather

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from there
is more than what they say

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:90%
is the way they behave.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:90%
Their actions.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:90%
There was a great couple.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:90%
There was always happy.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:84%
That all the children
we all were happy also,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:90%
just like them.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:90%
And there were how many of you?

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.271 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm the number
13 and the youngest one.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.490 align:middle line:84%
You?
OK.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Then, when I was
born, there was seven

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:90%
of my brothers living with us.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:84%
The others they're already
married with children.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Now how many-- there
were seven brothers?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Living with me.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Living with you?

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:90%
With me, there-- we were eight.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.969 align:middle line:84%
Oh, wow.
All right.

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So you were raised
in this tradition.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So at what point though did
you go to medical school?

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, two of my
older brothers, they

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:90%
were already medical doctors.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you decided to
follow in their footsteps.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Oh, definitely.
It was the logical way.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I see how they really enjoy
to be in medical school.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.075 align:middle line:90%
The effort that they did.

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:12.491 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, I want
to do the same thing.

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have
a point where you

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:84%
strayed from the traditional
ways that you raised with?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Science and the Toltec way
is exactly the same way.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.989 align:middle line:84%
-And explain that.
-OK.

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the word
Toltec means artist.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Artist.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Then, in my point of view,
every single human is an artist.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And medicine is an art.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:90%
It's really an art, medicine.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:90%
In the way that it's performed?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:90%
In the way that the body works?

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:90%
In every aspect of it?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, to study medicine is
studying one of the major arts

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:90%
that humans can do.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But every single human
is really an artist.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:90%
We always creating.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
We graces the moment that we
wake up, during the whole day,

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
until the moment
that we go to sleep.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And even when the brain is
sleeping, we still dream.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
We still creating because
this is our nature.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, we are like
the one who created us.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, the one who created us
create everything that exists.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
True, the creator.
Yes.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:90%
It create everything.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And it created us.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And we are as artist as
the one who created us.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But most of the people
don't have that awareness.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They just live their life
without that awareness.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can say that the
best art that we create

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:90%
is the story of our life.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
We live that story.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:84%
We believe that is
real, that is true.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.401 align:middle line:84%
But we create that story
using what we believe is true.

00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
True.
Yes.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And we make choices as you
did to reshape our lives.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
We can have a certain
idea of how it should be.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But we make the choices
that reshape our lives.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have any idea that
we are living in our own story.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And that story is only true
for us, but for nobody else,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.480 align:middle line:84%
because everybody
else, just like us,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:90%
they create their own story.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So you were living your story
of becoming a medical doctor

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and you went to medical school
and you practiced medicine.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And at what point--
what made you decide

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:90%
to leave that way of life?

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, I just shifted direction.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Because in certain point, it
was more interesting for me

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:84%
to understand the human mind,
to see how the mind really work.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, why we do
the things we do?

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Or you mean--

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Yes, why we have
to suffer so much.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Why everybody have
all those dramas

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and why is all that war
and violence and injustice.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to understand
how their mind works.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Because yes, I--

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But when I studied medicine,
I read a psychology books

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and psychiatric,
and-- but it was not

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.930 align:middle line:84%
enough because, you
know, they describe

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:90%
something for other doctors.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Then I decide to really
understand why we suffer.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And that make me go back
to my mother, my father,

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather, and
asking for their help

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.051 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want to go back
to school and study psychology.

00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.226 align:middle line:84%
Because I already read
all that and really--

00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
It was a different
perspective as well.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:90%
And I practiced for 10 years.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I becomes a-- well,
I'm already a nagual,

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
but I start working like a
shaman and I take apprentices,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:90%
I start teaching them.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And by teaching them, I
was going into their mind

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:90%
and see how they really work.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Now explain, if you
can, what a nagual is

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and how you got to
that place in your life

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
after you decided to leave
the medical practice.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.891 align:middle line:84%
Is that important if
we go so deep in this?

00:09:11.891 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%
This situation?
-Yes, please.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, nagual is a
part of the truth.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Part of the truth.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
We can say that for
millennials, humans

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:84%
are searching for the truth
and they highly comprehend

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:90%
what the truth is.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.445 align:middle line:90%
Is like this escaping, escaping.

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, the truth is
extremely simple.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It's just a binary system.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
see your computer,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.891 align:middle line:84%
everything is made
by one and zero.

00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And one and zero
create all those images

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
that you see, all the songs
that you hear in the computer.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the whole universe,
in the entire creation,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:90%
is also a binary system.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.242 align:middle line:84%
One is life and
the other is death.

00:09:59.242 --> 00:10:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
to prove that life

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.690 align:middle line:90%
exist because we all are alive.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Then we don't need to prove it.
-That's true.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.930 align:middle line:90%
We are alive.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Yet we're searching
for that life though.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
We're searching for it and
living it at the same time.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
to prove either

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that death exist because
we see death all the time.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
We know that our
physical body will die.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Many people that we
love they die before.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Then the whole thing is
nothing but life and death.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And the entire creation
is that dancing

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:90%
in between life and death.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:90%
You know, when we were--

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully said.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
That is beautifully said.
Yes.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Between life and death is that
tension between life and death.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:90%
That's what we call living.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, like you see in physic.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
We learn that matter only can
be move if a force moves matter.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And if matter is in
movement, only it can be

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:90%
stop if a force stops matter.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But matter by
itself can not move.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, the force that
moves matter is life.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:90%
And matter itself is death.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Is the binary system.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and that
dancing, that merging,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
we can perceive
everything that exists.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Even if you see, your
body's made by atoms.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.231 align:middle line:84%
And the force is moving,
the electrons, all the time.

00:11:32.231 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Constantly.
And that's what makes me move.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:90%
But the electrons are matter.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:90%
The nucleus is matter.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But is that force
that moves matter.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.611 align:middle line:84%
Now when you see your physical
body, you see your hands.

00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Your hands are matter.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:90%
But you moving the hands.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the force.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.409 align:middle line:84%
That's the force.
I see.

00:11:55.409 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Then your body is death.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Your body is death.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But is alive because
life is moving it.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:90%
So the matter is death.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But your life force
moves the matter.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's what makes us live.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.555 align:middle line:84%
And now the question is, are
you the body or are you alive?

00:12:13.555 --> 00:12:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The force that moves matter?
-So what?

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember, energy
cannot be destroyed.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Only can be transform.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Energy has no end.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Energy is life, of course.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Then, you are immortal.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I was just about to
say, so we can continue

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:84%
on and on and on if we--
-You cannot die.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Your body, yes, will die
because something that we need

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
to understand is that
anything that is being created

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:90%
will have an end.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.711 align:middle line:84%
So this helps people who
have lost loved ones a lot--

00:12:48.711 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
that their is energy

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
is living within them even
though the physical body,

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:90%
the matter, died.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.627 align:middle line:84%
Then their memory is still--
if their memory is alive,

00:13:00.627 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:84%
then they're still alive.
Is that right?

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're saying?
-That's right.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
why I so excited

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:90%
when I have the heart attack.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Wow.
Wow.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Because I can show everybody.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Now you ask me,
what the nagual is.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, the nagual is life itself.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:90%
And that is the tonal.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Tonal.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:90%
This the binary system.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Nagual and tonala.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Tonalas are the stars, but the
nagual is what moves the stars.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Is the force that
creates everything.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So tonal is the
earth and stars.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And nagual is the movement
that moves the earth and stars.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Then the nagual is the one who
have the awareness, that they

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:52.100 align:middle line:84%
know without a doubt
that we are alive

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:90%
and that we can move to tonala.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just
like in your computer.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, is moving
by ones and zeros

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:90%
and create the whole thing.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
That's-- imagine that the
computer have intelligence.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Brain.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:90%
A superbrain of some kind.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the computer
can say, oh, I am alive.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's happen when
you disconnect the computer?

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:90%
It dies.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:90%
It dies.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
But the energy is still there.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Life is still there.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So this life that you're
so beautifully orchestrating

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:84%
for us, that you're
painting the picture of,

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
did that bring you to writing
"The Four Agreements?"

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Is that what brought you to
those four beautiful messages?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, "The Four
Agreements" is the result

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
of practicing with my
apprentices for 10 years.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Then the challenge it
was to put it in words.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Mm, simple words.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But in words that everyone can
understand because "The Four

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Agreements," just
like "Mastery of Love"

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and "Voice of Knowledge",
"The Fifth Agreement"--

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:84%
all those books, they are
really psychology books.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:90%
It's about psychology.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.851 align:middle line:84%
But I don't describe
what is ego, superego.

00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I just keep the tools that
you can change yourself,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that you become
your own therapist.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So these are-- and many, many
people have used these tools

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:90%
to live their life by.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said that they're
simple, but they're

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:84%
very profound because you
measure up these tools

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
against every
action in your life,

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
your relationships,
your health, your job,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is that you do.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle line:84%
It really makes life flow
so much, so much easier.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Less energy.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Then you will find out that
there's not necessary to learn

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:90%
all those terms.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Because to learn psychology you
need to read all those books.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But instead of learn
all those terms,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%
you just use what make
your life very simple.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.492 align:middle line:84%
Then you start letting
go all those lies

00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
that you used to
create all this--

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:90%
all the dramas in your life.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Then will be so easy
to forgive, to detach,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.280 align:middle line:90%
to do all those things.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.025 align:middle line:84%
And you can say that
these four agreements

00:16:15.025 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
is the introduction of a
way of life, of the artist.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Or should I say, of
the Toltec, which

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:90%
is exactly the same thing?

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:90%
As the artist.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So, the first one, be
impeccable with your word.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:10%
This is basically to be
the artist of your life,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:10%
to live through to your word.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain
that a little bit?

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, we use the word in
order to create this story

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
of our life, everything that
you believe about yourself,

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and about everything
is made by words.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.780 align:middle line:84%
The language that you
speak is made by words.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Then, with those words,
you create a whole reality.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.490 align:middle line:84%
They're very powerful,
those words, very powerful.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Is the main one.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Because depends how
you use the word

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:90%
is how you gonna live your life.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:84%
You can create all those
dramas with all the suffering

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
or you can create
beauty as the artist

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy all the
romance of your life.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I never really thought
about it that way.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I thought you meant
to be authentic

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:90%
and to-- but you really mean--

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.959 align:middle line:84%
-Is the whole thing.
-The word.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:90%
The words you tell yourself.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.160 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
power behind that.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning was the word.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:90%
The word was with God.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:90%
The word was God.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
created by the word.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we are talking about
another word, a silent word,

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:84%
which is a silent
knowledge, which

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
is how the nagual
manifests itself,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:84%
which means how God
manifests itself,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:90%
how God create everything.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But we perceive it and we use
an image of what we perceive

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:90%
and that becomes the human word.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And with the human word,
you create your story

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.745 align:middle line:84%
and you live in that story, to
choose a replica of everything

00:18:04.745 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
that you are perceiving,
but not just use it in order

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:90%
to describe what you perceive.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you're saying, being
impeccable with that word,

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean by that?

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, impeccable come from
peccatus, which means sin.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.681 align:middle line:84%
And sin is anything you
do against yourself.

00:18:23.681 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Then, you are
impeccable with the word

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:84%
if you don't use the
word against yourself

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:90%
to hurt yourself.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And this what we
do all the time.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.029 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
Yes.

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So be very, very careful and
selective with what you use,

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.975 align:middle line:84%
how you use that beautiful,
powerful word, to orchestrate

00:18:42.975 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:90%
the story of your life.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Then, let's see, like Moses,
he put in the Ten Commandments,

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
love God with all your power
and the rest of the people

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:84%
the same way that
you love yourself.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
It's another way to say, be
impeccable with the word.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And the second
one, which is don't

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
take anything
personally, which is

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:90%
a great way to live your life.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, don't take
anything personally

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:90%
is completely logical, you know?

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
You create your own
story and in your story

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
you create a main character
of that story, which

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:90%
is what you believe you are.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But you also create all
the secondary characters

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
of your story which is all
the people that you know.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.600 align:middle line:90%
But they live in your story.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:84%
They do exactly the
same thing that you do.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
They create their story
and in their story

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:84%
they are main characters of
their story, but they know you.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But what they know about you
is just a secondary character

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.430 align:middle line:90%
that they create.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
They only know the secondary
character of their story

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
as you only know the secondary
character of your story

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
when you think
that you know them.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So what does that
mean when it comes to,

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:90%
not taking anything personally?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, if in their story, you
are on a secondary character,

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:90%
is a copy of what you are.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Is how they perceive
you and they

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:84%
distort you and they create
a secondary character

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.330 align:middle line:90%
who represents you.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And they want to control the
secondary character to be

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:90%
the way they want you to be.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And because you don't fit
in what they want you to be,

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
they will judge you, they
will have opinions of you,

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and they will express
those opinions to you.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.011 align:middle line:84%
So don't take those
personally or as truth.

00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-I see.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
agree with them, that

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
means you are
taking it personally

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and you will have an
emotional reaction.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Then, by not to take
anything personally,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:84%
use-- you becomes
immune with interaction

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that you have with
everyone around you.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.721 align:middle line:84%
So you're not subject to
their judgments of you.

00:21:00.721 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-Beautiful.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And now, don't make
assumptions, kind of follows

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
along those lines
of, don't assume

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:90%
that they're judging you.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, that have to be
with your knowledge.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you was
born, you have no knowledge.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:84%
-You learn everything you know.
-Yes.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Before you just perceive
the world, the real world,

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:90%
because you are the nagual.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:90%
You are life.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you
learn your language,

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:84%
now you use the word in
order to create knowledge.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is start thinking.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge create thoughts.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And just start listen.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge with a voice that
no one can hear but you.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So, when you were
raised by your mother,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and you learned everything
from your parents,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and you gathered your
knowledge from them,

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.967 align:middle line:84%
how did you learn not to make
assumptions of what it was

00:22:09.967 --> 00:22:10.900 align:middle line:90%
that they were teaching you?

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.691 align:middle line:84%
Because you took their knowledge
as law in the universe,

00:22:14.691 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I see them-- not
to make an assumptions,

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:90%
not to take things personally.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And I witnessed
for them to be very

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:90%
impeccable with their word.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Then you learn what you see.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, my mother used to
tell me that I can really

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:90%
make my dreams comes true.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
That the only thing that I need
is to have a very strong will,

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:46.740 align:middle line:84%
to know what I want, and to have
the discipline to make it real.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Now we are talking
about the four--

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
the agreement number four,
which is, always do your best.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Always do your best.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the action.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I
go around the world

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and I see everything
that we humans create,

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to understand
that everything

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
first exists in our mind,
and with the action,

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:90%
we make it real.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:90%
We manifest it.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.355 align:middle line:84%
This is how we create
all the civilization

00:23:14.355 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:90%
that exist in planet Earth.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So, "The Four Agreements"
were based on your teachings,

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and how you were raised
with your family,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and with all of the-- combined
with your medical profession.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So it was the combination
of everything, right?

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, be a
medical doctor, that give me

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.775 align:middle line:84%
enough information
to put in words

00:23:36.775 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
all those experiences
that I had in life,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's not that
easy to put it in words.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, the silent
knowledge is there.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And to boil it down into
these four principles, that--

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And in a way that anyone
can understand that.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:90%
And many have.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And now your
grandfather told you

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:90%
a story of the sleeping giant.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell that story?

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I was a child,
he told us that humanity

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:90%
is really a giant.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is dreaming and
is having nightmares.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:84%
He say, but they will
come with the giant awake

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and be aware that
all those nightmares

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:90%
were not real at all.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.735 align:middle line:84%
Then humanity will
shift and will change.

00:24:27.735 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Are we in that time right now?

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've been
like that for so long.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, and the
entire humanity,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
all the humans together, man
and woman, is only one living

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Then is real that, that giant.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
that living being

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:84%
is just an organ of the
bigger living being,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:90%
which is the planet Earth.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Just as the atmosphere
is another organ,

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:90%
the ocean is another organ.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.220 align:middle line:90%
The forest is another organ.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, every
single species

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:84%
who lives in the planet
Earth is another organ

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:90%
of the planet Earth.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And we all work together
to keep the equilibrium--

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that in medicine we
call the homeostasis--

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:90%
of the planet Earth.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Then at the same time, we are
an individual, we are humanity,

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:90%
and we are the Earth also.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Then whatever you do against
humanity, against nature,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:90%
you do against yourself.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Because it's only one.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So we are the sleeping giant
of humanity, essentially.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, humanity is the
sleeping giant and we

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:90%
are part of the sleeping giant.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And is the sleeping giant
described in the temples

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.180 align:middle line:90%
that you visited?

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:10%
Well, you find it
almost everywhere.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.500 align:middle line:10%
You see it in Egypt.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.380 align:middle line:10%
You see it in Greece.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:10%
In Teotihuacan, which
is my favorite place.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:10%
Teotihuacan, means the place
where human awaken becomes God.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's a place in Mexico?

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Teotihuacan?

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Teotihuacan.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Then I remember it was-- like
when I was like 37 years old,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.680 align:middle line:84%
that I visit Teotihuacan-- I
went to the Pyramid of the Sun

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
I see the giant.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.180 align:middle line:84%
You saw it from
that perspective?

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:90%
From what-- OK.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
We have some visuals of what
it is you're talking about.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:10%
So this is the temple
at Teotihuacan, Mexico?

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:10%
Yes, this is the
Pyramid of the Sun.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:10%
Pyramid of the Sun.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Is in Teotihuacan.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:10%
The size is very similar to
the great pyramid of Egypt,

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:10%
but the height is the half.
-Half of it.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.540 align:middle line:10%
And when were these built?

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:10%
They was built 2,500 years ago.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.380 align:middle line:10%
And the significance of it
is the Temple of the Sun.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:10%
So there was worship done
of the Temple of the Sun?

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.930 align:middle line:10%
Can you tell me a
little bit about--

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, really, it's
more than religion.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.991 align:middle line:10%
It's a little more
about science.

00:26:55.991 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:10%
Because they know that
light create life on Earth.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And light come from the sun.
-I see.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Then the Earth reflects
that life from the sun.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And light is working into matter
in order to create life forms.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I love how you
are always bridging

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.650 align:middle line:90%
science and spirituality.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:90%
You live that way.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Because there is no difference.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing, right?

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:90%
You know, life is a spirit.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a spirit.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And everything is art.
-That's beautiful.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I was in the
top of the pyramid

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and I was seeing the
stairs of the pyramid.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Like you see in the-- and
you see in the pyramid.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.270 align:middle line:10%
So you're at the
tip of the temple.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.580 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:10%
When you see the stairs, you
find something incredible

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:10%
that I never see on the books.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.840 align:middle line:10%
But I teach the apprentices
about what I see there.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.060 align:middle line:10%
And I see the image of
a Christ on the cross.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:10%
So show me that image.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:10%
Then if you see in the
bottom, there's a little square

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.040 align:middle line:10%
that it looks like a head.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.630 align:middle line:10%
In the center of the photo.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.360 align:middle line:10%
In the-- yes, in the
very-- in the very

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:10%
bottom of the pyramid--
-OK.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.962 align:middle line:10%
Before they start climbing.

00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:10%
Mm, hm.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:10%
It's the shape of a
head with something

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.760 align:middle line:10%
that looks like auras.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:10%
I see.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:10%
Then beside the head,
there's stairs that going up

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.670 align:middle line:10%
and it looks like
arms in this position.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Then, in you keep
climbing, you see

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:10%
those big stairs like
a square who looks

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.890 align:middle line:10%
like the body of a person.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Mm, hm.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I see exactly what
you're talking about.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Then keep climbing up.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.026 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple
of stairs, parallel

00:28:50.026 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:90%
that looks like legs of a man.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And, if you see the last
stairs that go to the very top,

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:90%
it looks like a wood.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, beside the head,
there's a little--

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.540 align:middle line:10%
that looks like a
wood behind the head--

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:10%
then it looks like the
Christ in the cross.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.900 align:middle line:10%
But it was 500 years
before the birth of Jesus.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid was built 500
years before the birth of Jesus.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:10%
But what really means is
that those stairs is just

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:10%
the shadow of a human that is in
the very top reaching the sun.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:10%
And what looks auras
around the head

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:38.660 align:middle line:10%
is the image of the
sun behind the head.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
What is really meaning is
the moment with a human start

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
leaving the physical
body becomes

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:84%
the light that we really are
and returning to the sun.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Then if you see, they
have all that information

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:90%
2,500 years ago.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But because at that time
there was not alphabet.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:05.640 align:middle line:84%
They use symbols
in order to teach.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I understand.
So--

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And you see it.
That big symbol.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And whoever going to
the Pyramid of the Sun,

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:90%
they see both directions.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The incarnation and the release
of life for the physical body.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The incarnation is the light
that is coming to Earth

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and creates all the
living forms on Earth,

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:84%
specifically the human because
we see the shape of the stairs

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.030 align:middle line:90%
is the shape of a human.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And that represent
at the same time one

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.420 align:middle line:90%
human and the entire humanity.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.224 align:middle line:90%
I have-- I have not--

00:30:41.224 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Just a giant, it's right there.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I have not ever
noticed that before.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Here's a larger aerial
view of the pyramids.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Then I see the other giant
there, which is the same,

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.670 align:middle line:90%
but is another symbology.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And is-- you see in the right
side of the Pyramid of the Sun,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.710 align:middle line:84%
there is what we know is
the Pyramid of the Moon.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And in front of the
Pyramid of the Moon,

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:84%
there's all this
series of pyramids

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:84%
that together give the
shaped of a head of a snake.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Then, that continues
into a straight line.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we know as
the Avenue of Death.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:22.181 align:middle line:84%
Oh?
Really?

00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Mm, hm.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And it really had the
shape of a body of a snake.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Then, in the left side, we see
the pyramids of Quetzalcoatl.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And in front of the
pyramid of Quetzalcoatl,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:84%
there is the Temple
of Quetzalcoatl.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.605 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Temple of
Quetzalcoatl have the shape

00:31:39.605 --> 00:31:42.720 align:middle line:90%
of a snake with the mouth open.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Then you see the shape of
a snake with two heads.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's the significance
of the shape of the snake?

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:57.345 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, the snake, it
represent a ray of light.

00:31:57.345 --> 00:32:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And one side is the sun and
the other side is the Earth.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:09.470 align:middle line:84%
In that case, is the moon
because who reflects the lights

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.780 align:middle line:90%
of the sun during the night.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Then the cycles
of life on Earth,

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:84%
it depends of the
amount of light

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that the moon is
reflecting from the sun.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:84%
You see like the-- usually
the periods of the woman

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.950 align:middle line:90%
is 28 days.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Is the whole cycle of the moon.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Then, that way is control.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.430 align:middle line:10%
So these pyramids
were built to reflect

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:10%
the basic light which is the
beginning and the end of life?

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Is that right?

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And all the cycles of life.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And all the cycles of life.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.390 align:middle line:10%
And this is why they call
it the Pyramid of the Moon

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:10%
because as you see, there's
a lot of science there, too.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.331 align:middle line:10%
And we are talking
about 2500 years ago.

00:32:54.331 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:10%
That's amazing.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.480 align:middle line:10%
That's amazing that
that was built.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.245 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time,
it also represents

00:32:58.245 --> 00:33:00.940 align:middle line:10%
the incarnation of a human.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we
have enough time.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:84%
This is getting so good.
-It's great.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.769 align:middle line:84%
It's great.
Yes.

00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, you take people
on journeys here.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And you show them
how these were formed

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and built this many years ago
and the significance of it.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:84%
This is another view
of the pyramids.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see there and it's
in the Plaza of Quetzalcoatl.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Then you see the pyramid
and-- no, no, no.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:84%
This is in the middle of
the Plaza of Quetzalcoatl.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Is represent this
whole human society,

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:90%
but without the awareness.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.880 align:middle line:90%
The center of it does?

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Then that little island
it represent the safe place

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:90%
where we feel comfortable.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:90%
We call it The Island.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the significance?

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were
built 2,500 years ago

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and so this was
explaining human life?

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Basically the journey of life?

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Step by step.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Step by step.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:12.159 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole-- like a whole
map going from everyday life,

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:15.250 align:middle line:84%
when we are really absorb by the
dream of the planet, which is

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:19.449 align:middle line:84%
the dream of the whole society,
and when we have awareness,

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:21.650 align:middle line:90%
and we are start shifting.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
We're finally-- we start seeing
with the eyes of the artist

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.571 align:middle line:84%
that we call Toltecs.
Yes.

00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Once that you don't longer
focus your attention in all

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.659 align:middle line:84%
the dramas and you don't
no longer feel sorry

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, that
from-- from that moment,

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:90%
everything shift for you.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:84%
You will see the
beauty, and that will

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.469 align:middle line:90%
change the story of your life.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, from that
point, you start going

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:90%
into the body of the snake.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:50.699 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to show
the picture again

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:51.929 align:middle line:90%
so that people can take a look.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So the very top of
the screen there,

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.580 align:middle line:90%
you see the head of the snake.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's in our top
right corner, right?

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And that represents life.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.401 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have
so many meanings.

00:35:05.401 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure.
I'm sure.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.450 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that in that time

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:90%
because there's no alphabet.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Then symbology can have so many
different meanings depending

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.970 align:middle line:90%
the level of the apprentice.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.825 align:middle line:84%
Then, for some apprentices,
you go from the very low level

00:35:23.825 --> 00:35:27.190 align:middle line:84%
that they can understanding,
but every time you

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:84%
use to [INAUDIBLE] to go a
little deeper, and deeper,

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.310 align:middle line:90%
and deeper, and deeper.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Then it's a way of teaching.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to university.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:40.500 align:middle line:90%
You start with a very beginning.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, like when I
go to medical school--

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:47.150 align:middle line:84%
the idea was to be
a medical doctor.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But first I have to learn
all those thick books.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:50.680 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Anatomy, physiology, et cetera.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:90%
In order to pass the test.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And it goes little
by-- and every time I go

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.470 align:middle line:90%
deeper and deeper and deeper.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:04.031 align:middle line:84%
And to be a medical doctor
is like to be a detective.

00:36:04.031 --> 00:36:05.640 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Is an art.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.277 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is.
Yes.

00:36:07.277 --> 00:36:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Of being-- it's all
about the diagnosis.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.760 align:middle line:84%
It's an art that use
science as a tool.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:84%
That's a beautiful
way of saying it.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about the diagnosis and
then how to reference the books

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.180 align:middle line:90%
to treat the diagnosis.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But you have to know
the diagnosis first.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Then, first is the artist,
which is every single human.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Then is the science
and technology.

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Or to religion.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Whichever direction we take.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So you take groups here
to-- and this is, again,

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.720 align:middle line:90%
another view of the pyramids.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is walking
down the aisle of--

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.756 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we going into the body of
the snake, the Avenue of Death.

00:36:42.756 --> 00:36:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Avenue of Death.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And they call it
Avenue of Death

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:84%
not because there is a
cemetery or something.

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
learn, you need to accept

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:90%
that you are dead already.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that you have
to get rid of old beliefs,

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.870 align:middle line:90%
you have to let old beliefs die?

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to be aware
that your body is dead already.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
You explained that at
the beginning of the show.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.285 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:05.285 --> 00:37:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Then if you don't have that
awareness, you cannot really

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.095 align:middle line:90%
go into the body of the snake.

00:37:12.095 --> 00:37:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It's only for death
with awareness, which

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:84%
mean the ones who wanted
to be on a nagual, who

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.740 align:middle line:90%
wanted to be life.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Is that detaching and see
everything in a completely

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:90%
different point of view.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the idea
of why you were excited

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:90%
when you had a heart attack.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:90%
This is making sense.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I can share
that with everyone.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:90%
So you have done that.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:84%
You've taken people to these
great areas of the planet.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And you've shown--

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, from the very beginning
when they come with me,

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I explain right away, OK, we
need to use the imagination.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Because everything will
happen in your story.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Then you really want
to have an experience.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.121 align:middle line:84%
You really need to
use your imagination.

00:37:57.121 --> 00:37:57.820 align:middle line:90%
You know something?

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.420 align:middle line:84%
That I agree completely with
Albert Einstein when he say,

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.171 align:middle line:84%
imagination is more
powerful than knowledge.

00:38:04.171 --> 00:38:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Because in the imagination,
everything is possible.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Then what I do is to
share the symbology that

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:84%
is there in a way that they can
understand then, and apply it.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Then they take the
symbology, they modify it,

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:23.122 align:middle line:84%
and they start sharing, if
they want to start sharing it.

00:38:23.122 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But they need to finish
first with themself.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So the people that you
take are your apprentices?

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, they used to
be my apprentices.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so how many
weeks is the journey

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.750 align:middle line:90%
where you take people out?

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, it goes like
three, four days.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But the effect that comes
is like going to therapy

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:90%
for three, four years.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you're teaching
the entire time,

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.080 align:middle line:90%
as we can see from the photos.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a picture of you
teaching at the steps

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Pyramid of the Sun.
Is that right?

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is behind is
the Pyramid of the Moon.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Of the Moon?

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And you-- right there--
that's a wonderful experience

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.220 align:middle line:84%
where you get to be in
the middle of the area

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:84%
where you're
teaching about life.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful journey.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, did you do
this around the end

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.660 align:middle line:90%
of the Mayan calendar time--

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.104 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:39:15.104 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I had the heart
transplant, is October 9, 2010.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you about
that really quickly.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.781 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
heart attack in 2008.

00:39:27.781 --> 00:39:30.050 align:middle line:84%
-2002.
-2002?

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Today, 11 years ago.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the 11 anniversary
of my heart attack

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:90%
while I was nine weeks in coma.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that time?

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Of course I do.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.700 align:middle line:90%
And I put it in words.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Then very soon will
be in a new book.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.501 align:middle line:84%
About the nine
weeks in the coma?

00:39:54.501 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:84%
No.
About the mastery of death.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:90%
How master death.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Which is what is next
after the fifth agreement.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Is the mastery of death.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.910 align:middle line:84%
That's this whole interview
has been about that,

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:13.410 align:middle line:90%
about the mastery of death.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, is part of the truth.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Life and death.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But to reach that
point, first you

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:25.060 align:middle line:84%
have to go over the
obstacles that we create,

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.250 align:middle line:90%
that the main one is fear.

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest obstacle.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Then is power.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Big obstacle.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Then is knowledge, the
biggest obstacle of all,

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:42.211 align:middle line:84%
because knowledge
possess the humans.

00:40:42.211 --> 00:40:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And once you win
over knowledge,

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.870 align:middle line:84%
you bypass knowledge, then
knowledge becomes your ally.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Your lie?

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Ally.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge becomes a lie?

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because now
knowledge will help you.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Before, knowledge
controls your life.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And knowledge dictate
every single decision

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.560 align:middle line:90%
that you made in your life.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.480 align:middle line:90%
But you create knowledge.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And you give all your
power to knowledge.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Then as you recover all
the power to knowledge,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and you no longer believe
in your knowledge,

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:25.920 align:middle line:84%
then knowledge will ally to
you, will be at your service.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So, the step beyond
knowledge is--

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.380 align:middle line:84%
When you pass
knowledge, the only thing

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.750 align:middle line:90%
left is death itself.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Which is your physical body.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Then you discover that
your physical body

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.520 align:middle line:84%
is being your angel of
death since the moment

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.710 align:middle line:90%
that you was conceive.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:53.640 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] fly
incarnate in your matter,

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.320 align:middle line:90%
then start moving death.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And the death begins
in that moment.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So being afraid of
death is simply--

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Is a nonsense.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.649 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge.
Ah.

00:42:01.649 --> 00:42:02.890 align:middle line:90%
It's just nonsense.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.000 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
your great-grandfather

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.790 align:middle line:90%
lived to be 116?

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:07.790 align:middle line:90%
16.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:90%
116.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:16.120 align:middle line:84%
In his life past 100, was
he teaching you about this?

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.063 align:middle line:90%
Well, I didn't meet him.

00:42:18.063 --> 00:42:18.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I meet his son, which
is my grandfather.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:84%
When I was born,
he really was dead.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But my older brothers,
they meet him.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And they say so many
great stories about him.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything is so magical
about my great-grandfather

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:90%
and also about my grandfather.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.670 align:middle line:90%
But I meet my grandfather.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:45.120 align:middle line:84%
For me the great grandfather is
more-- you know, more magical.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.470 align:middle line:84%
What were some of the stories
that you remember the most?

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Or one of the ones that
you remember the most?

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.650 align:middle line:90%
About my great-grandfather?

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Uh, huh.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, he have a whole
group that he taught.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was what they used to
call the party of the nagual

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:90%
because he was the nagual.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.985 align:middle line:84%
But all of them have
all those tricks,

00:43:12.985 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:84%
if we can call it
that way, that they

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.840 align:middle line:90%
applied with everybody around.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Would you call them tricks?

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, I called them tricks.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:90%
I didn't meet them really.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:24.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Then I only hear the
stories like, for example,

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:34.260 align:middle line:84%
one of his friends used
to take leaves of trees

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and give it to my brothers.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Like, when they get the
leaves, there was money now.

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And say, now go
and spend it right

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
away because in certain minutes
it will becomes leaves again.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Then they go run, buy all
those candies, and go out.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And really, when they
opened the little box,

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.960 align:middle line:90%
there was trees, not money.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.815 align:middle line:90%
The leaves of the trees.

00:44:00.815 --> 00:44:01.904 align:middle line:90%
Leaves.

00:44:01.904 --> 00:44:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And things like that.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So stories that were of magic,
but yet that were real life.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me it is just
stories, could be truth or not.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But either way they're
beautiful stories.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And they are also
stories of possibilities.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.940 align:middle line:84%
That everything
that you talk about

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and that you're-- that you've
learned is about possibilities.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's again, about
what is possible.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.371 align:middle line:84%
And that you can have
dreams come true.

00:44:34.371 --> 00:44:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what my mother
really taught me.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:39.710 align:middle line:84%
If I can make any
dream comes true,

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.510 align:middle line:84%
it-- if I just have the
strong will and the discipline

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.890 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:46.300 align:middle line:84%
You've mentioned strong
will a couple of times.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Now what do you mean by that?

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Strong will to get
through adversity?

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Strong will used for what?

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:52.940 align:middle line:90%
To create.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.720 align:middle line:90%
For creation.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.900 align:middle line:90%
I have that will.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.690 align:middle line:90%
For creation, exactly.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:02.240 align:middle line:84%
In my case, let's see,
I have the heart attack,

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.630 align:middle line:90%
and I was nine weeks in coma.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I was living with a 16%
of my heart capacity.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And even that the doctors tell
me that I should stay at home,

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.950 align:middle line:84%
just reading books
and watching TV.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, because of my will, I
keep teaching, I keep traveling.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And even if my body
was in pain, I will

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.210 align:middle line:90%
creating because of my will.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I remember interviewing
you after your heart

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.030 align:middle line:90%
attack on my radio show.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.541 align:middle line:84%
And you were preparing
your sons for your death.

00:45:34.541 --> 00:45:35.740 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-Yes.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And you were telling
them, and you were trying

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to get them ready,
and you were saying,

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:41.780 align:middle line:84%
do not be attached
to my physical body.

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Do remember that?

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that you-- what was

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.070 align:middle line:84%
the reason that you
were trying to teach

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:50.240 align:middle line:90%
them to detach from you?

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And here you are
now, full force.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, the main reason is
because I didn't know if I will

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.340 align:middle line:84%
die that night or next day.
-Right.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when I gonna
leave my physical body.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Then I was in a race
against death, we can say--

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that gained enough time
to prepare my children.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And I remember you
telling me the story,

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:84%
when your son was
crying over your body,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and you said, don't,
don't do that.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's when I
had the heart attack.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Then I was so, well, that
joy, celebrating my death,

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.220 align:middle line:84%
because when I
have that, I really

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:90%
wanted to show it everybody.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Then, after I called the 911,
I call my manager at that time,

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and I ask her, tell
everybody that I'm dying,

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:90%
that come to learn.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:49.320 align:middle line:84%
It's still amazing to wrap
my head around this concept.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I know that death is
not a popular subject

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:54.930 align:middle line:90%
and many people--

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.610 align:middle line:84%
We cannot deny
it's always there.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:57.735 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:46:57.735 --> 00:46:58.970 align:middle line:84%
-It's always there.
-Yeah.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:59.670 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.620 align:middle line:84%
That that was a big
opportunity for everyone.

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't
understood at that moment,

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:07.280 align:middle line:84%
is that being on intensive
care, they don't allow

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.240 align:middle line:90%
anybody to go and see you.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But my son, Jose,
came to see me.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And I show him what death is.

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Is like we say, there he
comes with all this drama,

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.581 align:middle line:84%
because it like he forget
everything he learn from me.

00:47:23.581 --> 00:47:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think that's
normal. [LAUGHS]

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, and I say--

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:30.430 align:middle line:90%
His father was dying.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.861 align:middle line:90%
Well, but, is not really.

00:47:33.861 --> 00:47:35.700 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was so happy.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.200 align:middle line:90%
He comes into the room.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:90%
And I have all that joy.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Jose, you are here!

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Start right away,
ha, Daddy, don't cry.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't die.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't finish with me.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.550 align:middle line:90%
And start falling apart.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Then I just-- then
I would say, Jose,

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.430 align:middle line:84%
this is how you
going to celebrate

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:90%
the death of your father?

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Get out of the room.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Fix yourself and,
when you are ready,

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.390 align:middle line:84%
come back because there's
something important

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:05.240 align:middle line:90%
I have to show you.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Then, of course, it was a shock.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:08.882 align:middle line:90%
Say wow.

00:48:08.882 --> 00:48:10.886 align:middle line:90%
But he went out.

00:48:10.886 --> 00:48:14.209 align:middle line:84%
And when he come back,
was another story now.

00:48:14.209 --> 00:48:17.360 align:middle line:90%
He say, thank you, Father.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.090 align:middle line:90%
I understood exactly.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I come here and take the
last moments of your life

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:33.320 align:middle line:84%
with my pity because I
will not see you any more.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:37.410 align:middle line:84%
With my selfishness,
I was taking

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:42.280 align:middle line:84%
the last moments of your
life without that awareness.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Then forgive me.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:45.820 align:middle line:90%
But now I'm with you.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And then he start telling
me, that when he was there,

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:84%
he was start
imagining that instead

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:59.320 align:middle line:84%
of being me who is dying, it
was him, that he was dying.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.860 align:middle line:90%
And then I come just like him.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, even I
went a little further.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:90%
I was already dead.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And I see you, that
you stopped teaching,

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.560 align:middle line:90%
stopped doing everything.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.340 align:middle line:84%
You just stayed at home,
feeling sorry for yourself,

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and let go everything you did
in your life just because I die.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And I say, but I
have an opportunity

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:24.860 align:middle line:90%
to speak to you for one minute.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Then I come to you.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I told you, Father,
I-- where I am, I'm happy,

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm feel wonderful, is great.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:39.340 align:middle line:90%
You're still alive.

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Don't waste your
life in that way.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Celebrate my death.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It's such a powerful story
because I remember it.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.990 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was a while ago.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:52.160 align:middle line:90%
It was about five years ago.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And I remember you saying that.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And you-- and both you and
Jose were in front of me,

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was watching you
explain that story.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Being a mother, my heart
was going out to him

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:05.950 align:middle line:84%
because I wouldn't want to
end-- and being a daughter,

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to see
my parents or my father

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:10.380 align:middle line:90%
in that situation either.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But you have a different
way of looking at it.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.090 align:middle line:90%
No, this a celebration.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a celebration.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Every time I see
you, you give people

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:22.691 align:middle line:84%
hugs, whether you know them
or not, whether you know them

00:50:22.691 --> 00:50:23.390 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Unless they don't
want me to hug them,

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.010 align:middle line:90%
then I don't hug them.

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have such
an enormous heart.

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me about
the heart transplant

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and about what happened
that led up to you

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.340 align:middle line:90%
getting a heart transplant?

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the doctors tell me
that it will be a miracle

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.970 align:middle line:90%
if I live one year after that.

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.161 align:middle line:84%
Not even thinking that I
can't make it for two years.

00:50:45.161 --> 00:50:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.231 align:middle line:84%
Then it was already eight
and a half years since died.

00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I was not died.
I was not dead.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course my body was
worse every single day,

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.720 align:middle line:90%
but I was keep going.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Then is when I decide that,
well, if I will not die,

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:02.950 align:middle line:90%
I better get a new heart.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:07.140 align:middle line:90%
You just decided that. [LAUGHS]

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I apply and then for a whole
year they studied my body.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.010 align:middle line:90%
For a whole year, what?

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They studied my body to see
if I was a candidate or not.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And finally, around August in
2010, they put me on the list.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell me, it will
take from six months to one

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.640 align:middle line:90%
year to have a heart for you.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, I will
not make it that long.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Then I told my son,
Miguel and Jose,

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
it will be that long.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that before December
I will have my new heart.

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I still have
a time to another journey

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.160 align:middle line:90%
with you guys.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Then, we was
planning to go first

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:56.661 align:middle line:84%
to New Jersey, Philadelphia,
Texas, to Denver, to Colorado.

00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, I was planning
to go to Teotihuacan.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Then Jose was planning to
go from Teotihuacan to Peru.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Then I was go to Ciudad
Juarez to go back to Phoenix

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and then finally go
back home and get

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.740 align:middle line:90%
ready for the transplant.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, we went to Philadelphia.

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Not very many people
plan a world tour

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.001 align:middle line:84%
before they have a heart
transplant, I gotta tell you.

00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:23.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, they say that six
to-- six months to one year.

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was planning, OK, before
December, I have time to come

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:33.160 align:middle line:90%
back and then I will be ready.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Weren't you praying, setting
intentions during that time?

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:40.070 align:middle line:90%
My life is intent, is ongoing.

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Then-- and my life is
a ongoing meditation.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.510 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have separate
times for prayers or--

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Unless if I have to share or
teach how, then I'll do it.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:55.180 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So you're- you were
in constant prayer,

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:00.260 align:middle line:84%
in constant meditation, and so
were your-- was your family.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, because there
is no thoughts there.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Then contemplation is
my way of meditating.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Running or doing whatever, any
activity is a way of creation.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.820 align:middle line:90%
That is a huge lesson.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.950 align:middle line:90%
That is a huge lesson.

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:20.931 align:middle line:84%
So your life is your
prayer and your medication.

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:23.077 align:middle line:84%
-Oh, definitely.
-I here to enjoy life.

00:53:23.077 --> 00:53:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Cause it's not separate.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:24.830 align:middle line:90%
To explore life.

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:27.360 align:middle line:90%
No, it's ongoing, everything.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
separate time for prayer,

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.760 align:middle line:90%
separate time for meditation?

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Unless I have to
share with somebody

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.570 align:middle line:84%
or teach somebody to
do it, then I will.

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So this interview has been
a meditation and a prayer.

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:41.283 align:middle line:90%
It is a meditation.

00:53:41.283 --> 00:53:42.090 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And I share it.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.970 align:middle line:90%
With everyone.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I showing is
really my love, because this

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.680 align:middle line:90%
is nothing but words.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.537 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I get it.

00:53:50.537 --> 00:53:51.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's not really the words.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Is just the presence.
-I get it.

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But we all have
the same presence.

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:59.990 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is that we
have all those thoughts, all

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that [INAUDIBLE]
in our head that

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.700 align:middle line:90%
don't allow us to see ourself.

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:08.180 align:middle line:90%
So I completely understand that.

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is a wonderful,
wonderful example that you have

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:15.320 align:middle line:84%
shared, that I and
the people watching

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:20.550 align:middle line:84%
have had the opportunity to
sit in meditation and prayer

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:25.425 align:middle line:84%
with you for the past
hour in this conversation

00:54:25.425 --> 00:54:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that we've had is
a beautiful example

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:33.510 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to
embody life and to be

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:35.340 align:middle line:90%
the artist of your life.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And I loved that you just taught
me that, that you don't have

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to have separate prayer and
meditation-- although it's

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:46.360 align:middle line:84%
nice-- but that you can
live your life in that place

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.050 align:middle line:90%
of prayer and meditation.

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:51.800 align:middle line:84%
If you can see, this is
the result of practice

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:54.891 align:middle line:84%
because is like this
what make the master.

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
I understand.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:59.470 align:middle line:90%
And we all are masters really.

00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:02.590 align:middle line:90%
But we master different things.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Like there's people who practice
anger for all their life

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and they think that they are
that anger or jealousy or envy

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.090 align:middle line:84%
is the result of
practicing for all

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that time, that it becomes
a habit, becomes automatic.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
this is what they are,

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.840 align:middle line:90%
but they are not.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not what they are.

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.831 align:middle line:84%
So they can
unpractice that anger.

00:55:27.831 --> 00:55:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:29.910 align:middle line:84%
You can live in
a different way.

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Take in and learn
all those lies.

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
of the four agreements

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and the fifth agreement.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.700 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth
agreement again is--

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Be skeptical, but
learn to listen.

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Is the conclusion of
these four agreements.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:52.490 align:middle line:84%
After practicing these four
agreements for certain time,

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:55.700 align:middle line:84%
then you will see
that, wow, now I

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:59.810 align:middle line:84%
can be skeptical, not
as a sociable position,

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:02.660 align:middle line:84%
but because you know that
the same way that you create

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:05.160 align:middle line:84%
your story and is true
for you, everybody also

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:07.760 align:middle line:84%
create their own story
and it's true for them.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Then whatever they say is
what they believe is true.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Then be skeptical, but
listen what they say,

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:19.320 align:middle line:84%
because that's the key,
to listen what they say,

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.950 align:middle line:84%
because they have the right
to express what they feel,

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.990 align:middle line:90%
what they know.

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to accept
it just because they say it.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But when you listen, you
will take for whatever

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:35.110 align:middle line:84%
they say, whatever
feed into your life,

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and makes your life better.

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Then learn to listen.

00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Take it to what we
know as respect.

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And respect take you to peace.

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:48.740 align:middle line:90%
First, with yourself.

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.490 align:middle line:10%
When you respect yourself,
you have that inner peace.

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:54.820 align:middle line:10%
You cannot give
what you don't have.

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:58.660 align:middle line:10%
Thing is you don't respect
yourself, you just pretend

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.590 align:middle line:10%
to respect everybody else.

00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:01.760 align:middle line:90%
But I respect you.

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you so much.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
sharing with us.

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It's such an honor to sit
with such a great teacher.

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:10.644 align:middle line:90%
So I thank you.

00:57:10.644 --> 00:57:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a great pleasure.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:14.820 align:middle line:90%
