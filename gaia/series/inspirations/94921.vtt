00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
From ashram to CEO
at 26 years old,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.380 align:middle line:84%
this one woman's journey
is both inspiring

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and filled with
challenges as well.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Amanda Holmes is my guest.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
She is the CEO of Chet
Holmes International, which

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
she stepped into as CEO after
the loss of her father, Chet

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Holmes.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And Amanda is joining us
to talk about the legacy

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that her father began,
along with Tony Robbins,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago, and
how she now continues

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
to help nurture businesses
using intuition and proven

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:90%
equations for growth.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.051 align:middle line:84%
>>AMANDA HOLMES: It's such
a pleasure to be here.

00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a
beautiful way of combining

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
so many different
worlds, Amanda.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And I love that you are
just a perfect person

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to have on Gaiam TV
because you really

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
do combine the yoga and
business and intuition and life

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:90%
challenges.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.279 align:middle line:84%
You're just-- you live
such a full life at 26.

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Oh, thank you.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.509 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm so appreciative
to be here, Lisa, really.

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, so
tell me a little bit

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:84%
about your childhood,
growing up and having

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:84%
a father in the personal
development world.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:90%
What was that like?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:84%
How were you parented
any different?

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, any different.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.125 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well, I look at Kayla,
and I say, that's exactly it.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:90%
My daughter, yes.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Your daughter
is me when I was her age.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And just growing up
with the knowledge

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that what you say really makes
a difference in your world.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I ever
said, I can't or I

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84%
don't think I could do
that, my father would say,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:90%
what's that called?

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And my brother and I would
say, failure reinforcement.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, funny.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: It was the
most hilarious thing.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.562 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:02:00.562 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can't is a four
letter word in our household.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: I knew it!

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything from
learning positive affirmations

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:90%
before I go to bed--

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Grades come easily to me.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.760 align:middle line:84%
--to him printing out what
affirmations I should have

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.162 align:middle line:84%
and putting them on the
inside of my bathroom mirror.

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I opened it up one day, and
there were all my affirmations.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, thanks,
dad, at nine years old.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did he get
his start, your dad?

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: I mean, Tony
Robbins was it, really.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge part of it.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And did he meet Tony
or was he already on the path?

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yeah.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
17 years, he went after
having Tony as a partner.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:90%
17 years.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
A big part of what
my father teaches

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:84%
is pig-headed discipline
and determination.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And if that's not it,
I don't know what is.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you went
the opposite direction

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
because then you went and
lived in an ashram for a very

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.126 align:middle line:90%
long time.

00:03:03.126 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: I still have
the determination.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.088 align:middle line:90%
But in a different way.

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: It's just different.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's, I think,
the way that it should be,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.720 align:middle line:90%
in my worldview.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:90%
So what did you learn?

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And why did you even go to
an ashram in the first place?

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well, it's
such a crazy story.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So originally, I was
a singer/songwriter.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And I went to college, did a
couple of records that way.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:90%
And then my father became ill.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped everything
I was doing, and I said,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a caregiver
for him, full-time.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find a
cure for his leukemia.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:90%
He was diagnosed with leukemia.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:90%
Very alternative.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
We had two people on staff going
through hundreds of submissions

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
of different alternative
medicines, everything

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
from Deepak Chopra to
psychics to gurus and monks.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I picked up
Reiki at that time.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So I was taking
away his headaches

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and his nausea every
day like clockwork.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
How's your headache?

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a 10.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Let me do some work.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
How's your headache
now, scale of 1 to 10?

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a 2.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.726 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
that was amazing.

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:90%
And then, fast forward.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:84%
He ended up getting skin
cancer on top of the leukemia

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
already from a light
therapy that we tried.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:90%
And came back into the hospital.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
have 30 legions

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:90%
this big all over your body.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Stop doing the alternatives.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to incision,
cut out all of those,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
stitch them back up, do chemo on
top of the leukemia you already

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
have, so the chemo that he was
already taking for leukemia.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:90%
And don't do any alternatives.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Guruji walked into my life.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And within a week of
her work, skin cancer

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.792 align:middle line:90%
was falling off of my father.

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting chills
just talking about it.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: And the doctor said--

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.947 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing myself
back there for a second

00:04:56.947 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:90%
and just going, wow.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:90%
I just can't even believe that.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:90%
They said, it's a miracle.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're doing,
don't stop there.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
But don't do any
other alternatives.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
bridging both worlds again.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.105 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be a theme with you.

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Very interesting.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So I went from doing
some energy healing that

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:84%
was like nausea and
headaches to this woman knows

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:90%
how to cure cancer.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got to learn
what she has to offer.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't deny that.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:90%
That was right before my eyes.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And in front of the
medical community as well

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.000 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So the skin cancer
eventually got eradicated.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yep.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then,
how did he eventually

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:90%
pass from the leukemia?

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: So he did his
bone marrow transplant.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And him and Guruji
parted ways at one point.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was still a devout
lover of what she did.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So after he was seemingly
good, everything

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
had-- the dust had
settled, I jumped over

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
what was supposed to be only two
weeks with some monks in Japan,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:90%
turned into six months in Asia.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I went to Singapore
and ended up living

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
in her ashram for
about five months.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my
family and friends,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go home.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I love it here.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm serving people.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm really healing, not just
me, but everyone around me.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's so beautiful.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Why would I come home?

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Forget my earthly possessions.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.974 align:middle line:84%
I'll just sit here and
meditate and help people.

00:06:23.974 --> 00:06:26.015 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What did you do
there for the five months

00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:90%
that you were there?

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:90%
What was the experience like?

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Oh my gosh.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Four AM chants.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.196 align:middle line:84%
And from my music background,
I took to that very easily

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
because originally,
I was like, I

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:90%
can't sit still to save my life.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:90%
That's really difficult for me.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to sit
and chant was something

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.080 align:middle line:90%
that I knew from singing.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So having that repetitive
mantra going really

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
made me feel really
comfortable, and then would

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
put me into this state
that was euphoric.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:84%
People talk to me
about drugs and what

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:84%
it feels like to
have a drug trip.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.705 align:middle line:84%
I've never done drugs
before, but I'm like,

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're
talking about.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I had this meditation thing
that I did this morning.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you, it
was pretty trippy.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You reach states of
bliss and Kundalini rises.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: All of it.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you learn
from, specifically, your guru?

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.769 align:middle line:84%
What did she teach you that
changed you as a person?

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: The biggest
takeaway that I

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
would say that she
gave me was learning

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
how to look for the
answers within myself.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And especially when I became
CEO of a multimillion dollar

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:84%
company, where every employee
is 20 years my senior,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of employees, and
my partner's Tony Robbins,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know who to trust.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was rough at
first to know really

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
who to believe in and
know who to go to.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And at some point it
just became obvious

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that I need to find the answers
here, find the answers here.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, relying
on the people around me

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
to give me all of
that information,

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
but, ultimately, I
make the decision.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my
whole world changed.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you and your father
ever have a conversation about,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.282 align:middle line:84%
you're going to take
over the business?

00:08:20.282 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: He would
have loved that.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:84%
He used to talk about
it when I was a kid.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.666 align:middle line:84%
He would be like, you could
take over the family business.

00:08:25.666 --> 00:08:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, pfft, dad.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.718 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm twelve.

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:31.666 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: I know.

00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:35.279 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I want to
play music in the trees.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to do.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted
to help people.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:90%
It's always been--

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my music was about
overcoming obstacles.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
With the healing, it was
about healing people.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And now, I never
would have guessed--

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I signed in to being
a part of serving as my highest

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:90%
purpose, they were like, OK.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.694 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, the
doctors called, said,

00:08:56.694 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:90%
you need to come home.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Your father's passing away.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Six weeks later, he passed away.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was almost like I
signed in, and they said, OK.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Your lesson isn't
to be in an ashram

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:90%
or under tree meditating.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
It's we're going to put
you in the real world.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
you a lot of power.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
you a lot of people.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask you about
those six weeks?

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
When you were with
your dad, at that time,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.104 align:middle line:84%
was it a healing
process for you?

00:09:27.104 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: That's amazing that
you actually point that out.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:90%
That's so crazy.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Was it a transition?

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Did you help him?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: My mom and brother--
I feel like those six weeks,

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know
that he was passing.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.179 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
the very last moments

00:09:44.179 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
that the doctors said, we
can't do anything else,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.665 align:middle line:90%
that they said, really?

00:09:47.665 --> 00:09:49.790 align:middle line:84%
They looked around and
went, he's supposed to live.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.915 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you meet my father.

00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:90%
He was Superman.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:90%
He took care of everybody.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:90%
He was larger than life.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So I came back with the
mindset of he's going.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything I need to
do is settle the things

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:90%
that I had that--

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Being a caregiver,
it's a tough job.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You were 23, 24, 25.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.473 align:middle line:84%
This is just a
couple of years ago.

00:10:14.473 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't mean to interrupt.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.639 align:middle line:84%
So those six weeks,
that process--

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: It was all
about just making sure

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that he was OK, making sure
that he was comfortable,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that he was
going, and doing everything

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:84%
in my power to make sure that I
said everything I needed to say

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and that I truly loved him.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And I got that from Guruji.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get that--

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:middle line:84%
That's a blessing
beyond blessings.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
His last moments, I can
remember whispering in his ear,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:90%
I have it.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.674 align:middle line:90%
I can take care of this for you.

00:10:44.674 --> 00:10:46.048 align:middle line:84%
I will take care
of this for you.

00:10:46.048 --> 00:10:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Don't you worry.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Instead of why are you going?

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.810 align:middle line:90%
It was, don't you worry.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.548 align:middle line:90%
Uh.

00:10:53.548 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did that enable him,
do you think, to transition

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:90%
more easily?

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: I think so.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.165 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Do you think?

00:10:59.165 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.190 align:middle line:84%

contact since then?

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Sorry.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well, for the
longest time, I didn't want it.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had nightmares up
until about a year and a half

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:90%
ago of my dad every night.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, multiple times
a week, I would just--

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And it would be either in the
hospital or just something.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was
fighting wanting

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.870 align:middle line:84%
to see him because I was
too afraid of knowing if--

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The trauma.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a lot.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And so have you since
then been able to--

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.955 align:middle line:84%
And was he ever a
spiritual person?

00:11:37.955 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Definitely.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he sat me
down when I was

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:84%
seven years old in
front of a candle--

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting that you say.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.154 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to bring a candle.

00:11:45.154 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
He sat me down in front
of a candle and said,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
you have the ability,
with your mind,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.166 align:middle line:84%
to make that candle go out
if you can focus on it.

00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So I really thought that
I had magical powers

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:90%

I'm sure it wasn't hours
now that I think back.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:90%
But very spiritual always.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%

We're going to take a look here
at a clip of her father, Chet

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.971 align:middle line:84%
Holmes, talking about a very
important quote by Henry David

00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Thoreau.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: So you're
65% of the way to a close

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:84%
if you just do the first
two things really well.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't do the
first two things really well.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So methods for developing
rapport, again, keep it simple.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Be their favorite cheerleader.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Have tremendous empathy.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Be more interested in them
than anyone else has ever been.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Talk about everyone's
favorite person.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And who is that?

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Them.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CHET HOLMES: Exactly.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Find the common ground,
common interest.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
You want to escalate
the bonding process?

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Find something that you have
in common with the person.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how fast it will
escalate the bonding process.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Like you discover you like
the same kind of music

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:84%
or the same artist or
something, and wam.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
The rapport just
builds like crazy.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:90%
So words to live by.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Thoreau said, "Maturity is
when all of your mirrors

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:90%
turn into windows."

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:84%
How many people have
heard that before?

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:84%
That's killer, like you
could live your life by that.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Read it again.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:84%
"Maturity is when all of your
mirrors turn into windows."

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.161 align:middle line:84%
Every day, that means
more and more to me.

00:13:56.161 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So the quote, "Maturity is
where all of your mirrors

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:90%
turn into windows."

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
How did that affect the
way he lived his life?

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Huge.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been hearing
that quote my entire life.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's really--

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
When he passed away,
the amount of people

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that came out and said, he
believed in me like nobody did,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:90%
it's because of that quote.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I keep getting chills.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.444 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing to me, Lisa?

00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:84%
His questions were always,
what are you doing now?

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
What would be your
wildest dream?

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.695 align:middle line:84%
What would that look like,
and how can we get you there?

00:14:36.695 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was his
conversation with everybody.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.028 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter
who they were.

00:14:40.028 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had
billionaires come to me

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.659 align:middle line:84%
and say, he believed
in me like nobody.

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, you're a billionaire.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:84%
But he always asked
about the dream.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:90%
It was always about the dream.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.561 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what does that mean?

00:14:52.561 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Maturity is when all of our
mirrors turn into windows.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.827 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.827 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: It's the
basis of everything

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:90%
that he lived in his life.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not focusing on
yourself, but, instead,

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:90%
looking to others.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It's sitting at a restaurant,
and a waiter comes up and asks

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%
you something and you
go, what's your name?

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Sit down.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Where do you come from?

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:90%
What's your family like?

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you know what.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like
an amazing family.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Here's $100.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Go have fun with
your family tonight.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Just that presence and
looking beyond the mirrors

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
into the windows of other
people's soul, I guess.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:84%
That must be what he did
because it was phenomenal.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You obviously
got this influence

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
of intuition and spiritual
growth from somewhere.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be that that's
what was the underlying

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:90%
theme of his life.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.405 align:middle line:84%
Yet on stage, he didn't
teach spirituality.

00:15:50.405 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
He taught personal development,
which is very linked.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well, he taught
sales, marketing, leadership.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- everything within
it had those fundamentals.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Like I was just talking to
Eben Pagan, David Deangelo,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.405 align:middle line:84%
he used to teach about the
love guru, or whatever,

00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
teaching girls how to pick up--
or guys to pick up on chicks.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And he says to me,
you know, Amanda,

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I was never teaching
dating advice.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.152 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching how
to be your true self.

00:16:21.152 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what you believe

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:90%
that your father was teaching?

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.237 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have chosen
to carry on his legacy.

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.569 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was it
like when you started?

00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:32.232 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
you were young--

00:16:32.232 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: It was a lot.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --in a company.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.362 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:34.362 --> 00:16:36.487 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: It was
very overwhelming.

00:16:36.487 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was it rough
at the beginning?

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Did you not believe in yourself?

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:90%
How did that go?

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: My father and I
were born on the same day.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Very few father-daughter
relationships

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:84%
are like what I
had with my father.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And to lose that, even
though I was prepared,

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
even though I know
it was coming--

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You never are.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yeah.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, I couldn't sleep.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to be there
in business meetings,

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
but all the while thinking,
what can I provide?

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.772 align:middle line:90%
What can I give here?

00:17:15.772 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:84%
I used age as a big
reason why I could never

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:84%
do anything of substance
within the organization.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:90%
And over time, I realized--

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wait.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.629 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:28.959 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Because I felt that
everyone else was in their 40s,

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:90%
50s, 60s.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my 20s.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting here,
going, oh my gosh.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.244 align:middle line:84%
I need gray hair to
be able to do this.

00:17:39.244 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's an
interesting point.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Someone dye
me some hair here.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You speak to the
Millennials, in terms

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
of that is a belief
system that some

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
hold onto that are breaking
the barriers about.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: So many more
CEOs that are young.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's phenomenal to me.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:90%
I love to see that.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Major heads of studios--

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Mark Zuckerberg.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --creating
a different way.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, so you
had this generation divide.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:84%
How did you gain the respect
of that older generation that

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
did have a lot more
time in the business?

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well,
there is no denying

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.818 align:middle line:90%
that I am my father's daughter.

00:18:18.818 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: I hate to say that.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, I
realized that how much

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I cared about my
father's legacy--

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And I-- knowing him as a man,
I knew that where all of his

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:84%
business came from is because of
his giving nature, because of--

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.640 align:middle line:84%
He was like Santa Claus
reincarnated, basically,

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:90%
would describe my father.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And that carried over to all
of his business methodology.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So then when I came in with
all the love in my heart

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:84%
and realized, let's put all of
these limiting beliefs behind

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and realized that
I can bring a lot--

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I have a heart the
size of-- a big heart.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I just have a big heart,
and I just want to share it.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you make
any changes initially?

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Not initially.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:84%
As time went on, it was
really my organization

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.032 align:middle line:90%
that made me step up.

00:19:17.032 --> 00:19:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I saw the people around
me, and they're saying,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Amanda, you keep asking
the right questions.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Speak up more often.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And I have so much to
thank about my intuition.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:84%
That was just such
a huge part of it.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And I understand my
father's methodology

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.441 align:middle line:84%
because I watched him
do it my entire life.

00:19:33.441 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
My bedtime stories were
about sales and marketing,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.777 align:middle line:90%
what he did that day.

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's talk about
some of the sales and marketing

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:84%
techniques that come
in with this foundation

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that you bring into it,
which is adding intuition

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to branding and marketing,
which is a brilliant way to kind

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
of infuse or bring
together both worlds.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
How have you changed
certain aspects

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:84%
of what your father has
taught with infusing

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
your skills, your abilities,
your talents with intuition

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and guidance into the
sales and marketing world?

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well, there is so much
that's holy ground of my father

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that's just timeless that
I would never even dream

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:84%
to change, because the way
that people interact, building

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:84%
rapport with somebody,
figuring out what they need,

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:84%
figuring out how to serve them
and give them something that

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:84%
will truly make their life
better, that's timeless.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:34.177 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any plans
of rewriting the book.

00:20:34.177 --> 00:20:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.245 align:middle line:90%
But you're also a yogini.

00:20:36.245 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
bring that into it.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: So for
example, we just

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
did this whole
campaign, how I'm just

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.950 align:middle line:84%
giving a whole bunch
of education for free.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And in it we're talking
about how to cold call.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And the first step I added
in, take a deep breath,

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and I went through a
whole breathing exercise.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
That's just one small example
of a much bigger picture

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.983 align:middle line:84%
of how when I take my
father's methodologies--

00:21:03.983 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:84%
The different formats
that we have--

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So my dad talks a lot
about direct mail.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And he may say the
word fax or pager.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:84%
It's my job to take those
roots and blossom them

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
into a Lead Magnet or a
Facebook page or something

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing on Gaiam TV.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It's different modalities,
just like healing.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's the same
base is what you're saying.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Exactly.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:35.865 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:21:35.865 --> 00:21:36.424 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:36.424 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
take a look here

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.770 align:middle line:84%
at a video that talks
about a sales model

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:90%
that Chet Holmes describes.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.829 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
heart-centered business style

00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:90%
that he comes from.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: Chiropractor
in the Yellow Pages.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:84%
You go to the
Yellow Pages, right?

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:90%
You're a chiropractor.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:90%
You go to the Yellow Pages.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
There's 400 other chiropractors
in the Yellow Pages.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So we created an ad
for a chiropractor that

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
said, "Before you
hire a chiropractor,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:84%
there's three things
you better know.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Call us, and we'll teach
you that for free."

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.402 align:middle line:90%
So picture yourself.

00:22:09.402 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:84%
You're in the Yellow
Pages, looking

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:90%
at all these chiropractor ads.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.079 align:middle line:84%
And one of them says, before you
decide which chiropractor, know

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:90%
these three things.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:90%
We'll give it to you for free.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
They went from getting, I think
it was like 17 phone calls

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
a month to five
phone calls a day.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were preempting
the competition.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that a strategic objective?

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
How can you preempt
your competition?

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.867 align:middle line:84%
What can you offer, no matter
what it is that you sell,

00:22:34.867 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that your person's
going to say, well,

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
let me check that
out before I buy?

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Because is this preemptive?

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So again, what I said in the
last workshop is how can you

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:84%
help your client
be more successful?

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:90%
There's an example.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
You can help your client be
more successful by teaching them

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:84%
the six most important things
they should know before they

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:90%
buy a product like yours.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And it should be
full of market data

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.520 align:middle line:84%
because, if you look at
your strategic objectives,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.729 align:middle line:84%
and one of them was raise
your credibility, right?

00:23:02.729 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to raise
your credibility

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
if you've got a thing
like that in your pocket

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.710 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking to
me about buying a car?

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:08.504 align:middle line:90%
Yes or yes.

00:23:08.504 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHET HOLMES: OK.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to position
you as more of an expert?

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: Is it going
to give you more influence?

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: Is it going
to help you be more trusted?

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHET HOLMES: More respected?

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: Is it
worth doing, then?

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.059 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:21.059 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So in that video, he talked
about a buying pyramid.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.518 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Phenomenal concept.

00:23:28.518 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you ever have some
kind of product or service--

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that
I'm a chiropractor.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And I want to teach
chiropractic to people,

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and I know that I'm
a great chiropractor.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.296 align:middle line:84%
But as I walk up
to somebody and I

00:23:44.296 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
try to talk to them
about chiropractic,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:90%
they go, no, you're an ad.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Nope, that's a
banner ad or nope,

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that's another
salesperson calling me.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So many people are so
cluttered by the amount of ads

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:90%
that we have in every day.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:90%
How do you get past that?

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:84%
How do you get past that, even
if you're a great chiropractor?

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Very difficult.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So the buying pyramid
is the perfect example

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:84%
of if you broke down
all of your buyers.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had a piece of paper.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:90%
But imagine--

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So people that are
watching, draw a triangle.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:90%
The top 3% are people--

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you say 100
people pass by something

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:90%
that you have, an ad on a bus.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:90%
100 people pass by it.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
3% of those people are currently
buying your product or service

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So for a chiropractor, 3% are
interested in chiropractic,

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking
currently for a chiropractor.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Or you're a car company, and
someone's interested in a car.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, 3%--

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Majority of the time, 3%--

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Studies show 3% are interested
in buying right now.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:90%
7%--

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:90%
So, pyramid, 3%--

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.182 align:middle line:84%
7% are interested in buying,
but not really right now.

00:25:03.182 --> 00:25:05.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I've heard
of that chiropractic thing.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should go and
look, check that out,

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.720 align:middle line:90%
not quite buying now.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.417 align:middle line:90%
Same with a car.

00:25:11.417 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you know, I should get a car
in the next couple of months.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:90%
So they're interested.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's only 10% of
that buying pyramid that

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:90%
are interested in your product.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:90%
The rest, 90% are not.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Exactly.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:90%
You're quick.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you break it down,
30% are just oblivious,

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.284 align:middle line:84%
don't know anything
about chiropractic,

00:25:37.284 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
don't even know that
they're interested.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Then there's another
30% that think

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:90%
that they're not interested.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of that
chiropractic thing.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.344 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
really for me.

00:25:44.344 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the last 30% know
they're not interested.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I've heard about that.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:90%
I had a bad experience.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I would never go back
to a chiropractor.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So the way that my father
used education-based marketing

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:84%
is writing something or
giving some kind of value

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't just
affect the top 10%.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It affects the entire
buying pyramid.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these are
business tips and techniques

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that you can
actually use but then

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.307 align:middle line:84%
turn it around to
appeal with rapport.

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So learning about
chiropractic and how it helps

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
in healing and so forth
is what you would give,

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:26.015 align:middle line:84%
instead of a business card and
a sales pitch or a cold call.

00:26:26.015 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yeah.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead of talking
about yourself,

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about them.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.304 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking about
what interests them.

00:26:31.304 --> 00:26:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where
would you put that?

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: It could be anywhere.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.489 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, in--

00:26:36.489 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
You're probably going
to do a clip of that,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:90%
so I won't talk about that.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's say someone types
in Google, chiropractor.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And a bunch of
chiropractors come up.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
You want to have,
instead of saying, hey,

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.762 align:middle line:90%
I'm a chiropractor.

00:26:50.762 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm really great.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:90%
This is my pricing.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Instead say, here's
the four things

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that you need to know
before you go and engage

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:90%
with a chiropractor.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's building
rapport, right?

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yeah.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it definitely
builds rapport.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
many things it does.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It builds trust.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.973 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: It builds trust.

00:27:08.973 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It builds credibility.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:90%
It builds authority.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:90%
You're an expert in your field.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Market data.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Market data is huge.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
If you can use market data
within what you're doing,

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:84%
instead of talking about
your products or service,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.177 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
about statistics,--

00:27:24.177 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tips, facts.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.051 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: --case studies.

00:27:26.051 --> 00:27:26.675 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:26.675 --> 00:27:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Great point.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.196 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
here at another piece,

00:27:30.196 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:84%
where Chet Holmes is talking
about building rapport, a very,

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:33.931 align:middle line:90%
very important technique.

00:27:33.931 --> 00:27:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: Here's
the thing, if I

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:84%
have a really good
relationship with you,

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:84%
it's a violation
of our relationship

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.607 align:middle line:84%
for you to advertise
in a competitor

00:27:43.607 --> 00:27:44.940 align:middle line:90%
without approaching me about it.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
control you need

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:90%
to have in your marketplace.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
They're never going
to go and hire or use

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:84%
one of your competitors if you
have deep rapport with them.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like the bulletproofing
to make sure you cannot be hurt

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:90%
in your industry.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:90%
So rapport tools are essential.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Market data equals
serious rapport

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.600 align:middle line:84%
because it establishes
tremendous respect.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Any time you start
teaching someone something,

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:84%
you take a position
of authority.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make sure
that you have information

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.625 align:middle line:90%
that helps your clients succeed.

00:28:19.625 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Remember what I said.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:84%
The best strategic
position for all of you

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is to find ways to help
your clients succeed.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't help but
want to reciprocate

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.650 align:middle line:90%
someone who helps you succeed.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.329 align:middle line:84%
So that should be part
of every person's job.

00:28:34.329 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And if it's not natural--

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:36.744 align:middle line:84%
And I've had
salespeople who were

00:28:36.744 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:84%
fantastic closers are
not natural bonders.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So I created situations, and
environments, and exercises,

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and tools, like those parties
we threw at every trade show.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:84%
They were designed to get
our salespeople to bond

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.717 align:middle line:84%
with the clients
in the industry.

00:28:52.717 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And it worked really well.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.980 align:middle line:90%
We were bulletproof.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't touch us, nobody
could for the whole

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:57.700 align:middle line:90%
reign I had there.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.100 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a workshop
on building rapport.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:25.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.715 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So are there
stories or examples

00:29:27.715 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:84%
that you saw that your
father put this into practice

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.285 align:middle line:90%
in his life or in his business?

00:29:32.285 --> 00:29:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Definitely.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Some stories.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Every
prospect or a person

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to work with, he
would always go after them as

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
if they were going
to be his friend.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And I can say that he worked
with all of his friends.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And he built a relationship
that will last.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you build a
business that's bulletproof

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.536 align:middle line:84%
is by cultivating
those relationships.

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you a
little nugget here.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:84%
One question that he used to ask
people over dinner, his clients

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that he would spend numerous
hours with, he would ask,

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.470 align:middle line:84%
if you could go back
to the age of 15

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.770 align:middle line:84%
with everything you
know now, but you

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
would lose everything you
have, would you do it?

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So you would lose your
possessions, your house

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:90%
and all of that?

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Your kids.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just your knowledge.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: You know how
you raised your kids.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
You know what you
did in your career.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Would you go back, and
would you relive it?

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm, no.

00:30:26.425 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.556 align:middle line:84%
I'm totally happy
with where I am.

00:30:31.556 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: So that's
a beautiful answer.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's questions
like that that

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:84%
go deeper into
who the person is.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.050 align:middle line:90%
It goes back to the dreamer.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.280 align:middle line:90%
What's your dream?

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.429 align:middle line:84%
Further than the surface
of, oh, you have kids.

00:30:44.429 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what are their names?

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It forces you to
look at what you have now

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and how grateful you
are and how much you've

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.740 align:middle line:84%
worked to be in
this place in life.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it does definitely.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not there,
then yes, it would make

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:90%
sense to go back.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way of looking in
and reflecting on your life,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
or finding another way to
reflect back onto your life.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.816 align:middle line:84%
He also talks about working
smarter, not harder, which is--

00:31:12.816 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Huge.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, because
I equate hard work--

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.254 align:middle line:90%
We've all learned this.

00:31:17.254 --> 00:31:19.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, you work in the
fields, you get the fruit.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:90%
You get the vegetable.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:21.495 align:middle line:90%
You work hard.

00:31:21.495 --> 00:31:21.995 align:middle line:90%
You labor.

00:31:21.995 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
necessarily hold true

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.650 align:middle line:84%
in the business world,
especially with technology

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.720 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
How have you used that or
changed that differently

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.370 align:middle line:90%
in your business now?

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well,
anything to scale,

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:84%
if you want to grow a business,
if you want to grow your life,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.560 align:middle line:90%
if you--

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:84%
The process of reflecting
back on what you have--

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.670 align:middle line:90%
My father says, one hour a week.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Spend one hour a week
working on your business,

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:90%
instead of in it.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:90%
And this equates to life.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Reflect back on what
have you done this week?

00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:90%
What does your week look like?

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you reevaluate and
figure out, OK, this

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:04.414 align:middle line:84%
is how I'm going to
live my next week.

00:32:04.414 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm
going to automate

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.455 align:middle line:84%
so that I don't have
to deal with that.

00:32:07.455 --> 00:32:09.496 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm going to
solve because I noticed

00:32:09.496 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that this problem
keeps coming up.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to do?

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Change, too.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Change really causes
you to reflect.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that
change happens

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.370 align:middle line:84%
when you're not ready for
it in business and in life.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And it causes you really to take
a look at what means something.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a good reflection tool.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:84%
He talks also about a
specific sales model.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It's called, oh, the
core story sales model.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:34.790 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.730 align:middle line:84%
It seems a lot of the
company is based on that.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Huge, the
education-based marketing.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:90%
The example of a chiropractor--

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So somebody that has a beautiful
product or service that

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:90%
could change the world--

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.860 align:middle line:84%
--and people aren't
interested in it,

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:84%
getting their attention by that
education with market data,

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.981 align:middle line:84%
entertaining people,
giving something of value.

00:33:01.981 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, hey,
I want to talk about me,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.817 align:middle line:90%
it's, hey, let's figure out you.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's work through
what you need.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's get your attention
through market data.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could testimonials
work in that core story?

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:90%
It's later on in the process.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Core story is
really about getting

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
not just the buying now, not
just that top 10% of the buying

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.120 align:middle line:90%
pyramid, the entire pyramid.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.470 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
By instead of saying, hey, I'm
a chiropractor, say learn--

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.423 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think of all
of the different core stories

00:33:36.423 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:90%
we've done.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.955 align:middle line:90%
I'll use a safe example.

00:33:38.955 --> 00:33:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have a client that
sells safes to schools.

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And schools have just
not been picking it up.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:84%
They're just not interested
in what they have to offer.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.288 align:middle line:84%
And they've been doing
it for five years.

00:33:50.288 --> 00:33:53.720 align:middle line:84%
We currently are working with
them on their core story.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the last month,
they've gotten more response

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:84%
from schools than they have
in the last five years.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.710 align:middle line:90%
In just one month.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wanting to buy safes?

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's because instead of
coming up to them and saying,

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.580 align:middle line:90%
hey, guys.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.920 align:middle line:90%
You want to buy safes?

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.925 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:11.917 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:13.629 align:middle line:90%
I'll come back later.

00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Want to buy safes?

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
It's me, me, me, my product,
my product, my product.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.989 align:middle line:84%
Instead, coming in
and saying, there's

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:24.429 align:middle line:84%
four things that you need
to know about your school

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
if you want to increase
the amount of people that

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.139 align:middle line:84%
are coming to your school,
increase admissions, decrease

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:38.020 align:middle line:84%
the likelihood of violence and
theft happening in your school,

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.570 align:middle line:84%
because we built a
whole story around all

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
of the crazy things
that happen with theft--

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The amount of college
students that experience theft

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:90%
is unreal.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.239 align:middle line:84%
And it's even higher
from the people

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:90%
that they're living with.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.870 align:middle line:84%
It says that their own roommates
are stealing from them.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So to bring that
up and point it out

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to the school administration
and say, not only

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.594 align:middle line:84%
are your students stressed
because they're afraid

00:35:06.594 --> 00:35:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that their stuff is
going to get stolen.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:90%
What does that do you?

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel comfortable
in your environment?

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.520 align:middle line:90%
What about admissions?

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.811 align:middle line:84%
When people make a decision
where they're going to go--

00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Parents, yes, yes,
it's all about safety.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: One of the
top reasons is safety.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And teaching them that and
bringing something of value

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and really being an expert
on their needs, then you say,

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.170 align:middle line:90%
here's a solution.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:33.221 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is so much better
than an annoying phone call.

00:35:33.221 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Do you
want to buy a safe?

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Why would I want to buy a safe?

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Well now, because you know
that it links directly

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:84%
to your admissions,
it links directly

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to making sure that your
students have a better

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.430 align:middle line:84%
experience, that they
feel safe, that they feel

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.806 align:middle line:84%
that their things
are protected--

00:35:48.806 --> 00:35:49.721 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is great.

00:35:49.721 --> 00:35:50.350 align:middle line:90%
That is great.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:50.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look here at what
Chet Holmes is talking about

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.320 align:middle line:84%
in terms of grabbing
someone's attention,

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:84%
but without doing it
in an annoying way.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:57.974 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:35:57.974 --> 00:35:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: So
your tonality actually

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:84%
has five times more impact
than the words that you use.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And not consciously, but
subconsciously, the prospect's

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.490 align:middle line:84%
subconscious picks up every
subtle nuance of your tonality.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Understand that
to have authority

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:90%
you end on the down note.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.154 align:middle line:90%
So to--

00:36:18.154 --> 00:36:18.695 align:middle line:90%
Good evening.

00:36:18.695 --> 00:36:20.739 align:middle line:90%
Is this Jeffrey Hall?

00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Good evening.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.787 align:middle line:90%
Is this Jeffrey Hall?

00:36:22.787 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you see the difference?

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:84%
When you go up like
this at the end,

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:90%
you sound like a salesperson.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And the one that kills me
is, is this Jeffrey Hall?

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.980 align:middle line:90%
How you doing today?

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:84%
I tell my salespeople, don't ask
people how you're doing today

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.660 align:middle line:84%
because you sound
like a salesperson.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:90%
I never say to anybody--

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.360 align:middle line:84%
When I was cold
calling and trying

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.680 align:middle line:84%
to get Michael Eisner
on the telephone, when

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.960 align:middle line:84%
he got on the phone, I don't
go, how you doing today?

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Michael, hi.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.543 align:middle line:90%
This is Chet Holmes.

00:36:50.543 --> 00:36:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Right to business.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:56.691 align:middle line:84%
I want him to feel the authority
of that thing in the first five

00:36:56.691 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:90%
seconds.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So all of you salespeople,
will you please stop saying,

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:01.880 align:middle line:90%
how are you doing today?

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Just drop it from
your vocabulary.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:84%
That's as bad as, thank
you for your business

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.790 align:middle line:90%
or thank you for your time.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Ending on the up note tells
them you're a salesperson.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Practice sounding
like a newscaster.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They are trained
to have authority.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Jones, Hugh Downs.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So you help medium, large,
small businesses really

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.180 align:middle line:84%
learn how to reform their
stories so that they

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.972 align:middle line:84%
can learn-- or they can
actually increase their sales.

00:37:29.972 --> 00:37:30.930 align:middle line:90%
That's the bottom line.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:31.513 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes.

00:37:31.513 --> 00:37:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So once they have that
rolling and things are going

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.980 align:middle line:84%
well for them, what
about the inner office?

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Because when you take
that type of growth,

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.150 align:middle line:84%
you need to pull everyone
up to that speed.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So time management
is a huge issue

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:46.310 align:middle line:90%
for myself and many others.

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.403 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: And a
majority of the people

00:37:48.403 --> 00:37:51.170 align:middle line:84%
can't implement those
kinds of strategies

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.591 align:middle line:90%
without the time management.

00:37:52.591 --> 00:37:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first step.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
chapter of the book.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the beginning.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yep.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So what are some techniques
that you use around efficiency

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.165 align:middle line:90%
around time?

00:38:03.165 --> 00:38:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Huge.

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.082 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just-- I
go back to the book.

00:38:06.082 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I go back to the
book all the time.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Touch it once.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.697 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's so hard.

00:38:10.697 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, I want
to read that email four

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:13.196 align:middle line:90%
different times.

00:38:13.196 --> 00:38:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But how many hours do you lose
a year re-reading an email?

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's constantly.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a constant, ever-evolving,
training and mastering of--

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.892 align:middle line:84%
In the email subject
line, are you

00:38:24.892 --> 00:38:26.600 align:middle line:84%
changing that subject
line every time you

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.183 align:middle line:84%
send an email so
that you can actually

00:38:28.183 --> 00:38:29.460 align:middle line:90%
find it when you come back?

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.001 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
do on your phone?

00:38:31.001 --> 00:38:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you get sucked
into the emails on your--

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.206 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Oh, it's
definitely difficult.

00:38:35.206 --> 00:38:37.882 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Always there, yes.

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:40.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you choose what
to pay attention to,

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.725 align:middle line:84%
what to answer on your
phone, what to wait and give

00:38:41.725 --> 00:38:43.058 align:middle line:90%
a response to when you get home?

00:38:43.058 --> 00:38:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you have a
way of managing that?

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: It really breaks
down into impact areas.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So this could be for a CEO where
they pick, which for us, it's

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:84%
the different divisions
that we have in our company.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:84%
For somebody it might be health,
their family life, their work

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:05.440 align:middle line:90%
environment, their fitness.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.139 align:middle line:84%
And you pick those
different areas,

00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and then you focus on them
for a certain amount of time

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:90%
every week.

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's one hour a week,
the one hour a week working

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.560 align:middle line:90%
on your business.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the way to really
figure out, manage, OK,

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.850 align:middle line:90%
that's something from--

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Like I know you have many
businesses, putting that into,

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is when I'm going
to handle this business.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.870 align:middle line:84%
This is when I'm going
to handle that business,

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and really chunking it down.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And the whole process
of doing the to-do list

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.025 align:middle line:84%
and figuring out what
the top priorities are,

00:39:36.025 --> 00:39:38.825 align:middle line:84%
and-- the six steps
are so important.

00:39:38.825 --> 00:39:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So important.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.075 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to take a
look at that in just a second.

00:39:42.075 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But you mention a
great point here,

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:90%
where we look at ourselves as--

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:84%
We could look at ourselves
as our own business.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.060 align:middle line:84%
We have our personal
development.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:90%
We have our health development.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.870 align:middle line:90%
We have our relationships.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We have our living
spaces and stuff.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:00.830 align:middle line:84%
If you take that
wheel and look at it,

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:02.750 align:middle line:84%
you're saying
spend an hour a day

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.140 align:middle line:84%
on development of each
one of those things.

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Like you can still go work
out every day of the week,

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.940 align:middle line:84%
but you need to work on
the development of what

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.811 align:middle line:90%
that working out is.

00:40:12.811 --> 00:40:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: That's how you grow.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.332 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:40:15.332 --> 00:40:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Beautifully said.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Chet Holmes talking
about some of the six

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:22.370 align:middle line:90%
steps of productivity.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:38.714 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.714 --> 00:40:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CHET HOLMES: For me.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.129 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:40.129 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So touch it once is the
number one rule, number one

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.440 align:middle line:90%
rule of time management.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.640 align:middle line:84%
The average office
worker spends a month

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:84%
per year re-reading
the same information

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:90%
without taking action.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you touch it,
you deal with it.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:90%
You create a file.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So even in my briefcase, I
have files for everything.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.320 align:middle line:90%
So when my assistant--

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm going on a trip.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.860 align:middle line:84%
She goes into my
briefcase and puts

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.770 align:middle line:84%
the itinerary in this file,
the contract in this file

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that I'll be
discussing, the checks I

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.750 align:middle line:84%
want to hand out to
somebody in this file.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:90%
They're all in files.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Everything is organized.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.750 align:middle line:90%
It should be in a file.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
computer organization.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So I am on the
phone all the time

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.476 align:middle line:84%
with people who work for me
who say-- I'll say to them,

00:41:25.476 --> 00:41:28.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, there
was that article I

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.690 align:middle line:90%
did about hiring top producers.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you use
that as the basis?

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, if I can find that.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.183 align:middle line:90%
Click, click, click.

00:41:34.183 --> 00:41:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Three clicks, and
I have the article.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:37.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Anything on my computer,
I'm five clicks away from it

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:90%
at the most.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:41.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:42.950 align:middle line:90%
So files for everything.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.224 align:middle line:84%
So I keep everything
in client file.

00:41:45.224 --> 00:41:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I have
the presentations,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.940 align:middle line:84%
which are where all
the core stories are.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And there might be
10 drafts of that.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.380 align:middle line:84%
A core story's a living,
evolving thing, as I said,

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.920 align:middle line:90%
so they constantly change.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.477 align:middle line:90%
Promo pieces.

00:41:54.477 --> 00:41:56.810 align:middle line:84%
What are the promotional
pieces we have for that client?

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what we
develop for you guys.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Direct mail-- our direct
mail pieces, the work

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.750 align:middle line:84%
in progress, because those
are things in the middle.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.208 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
to put them yet.

00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:06.250 align:middle line:90%
They're just work in progress.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Workshops, they're laid out.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.025 align:middle line:84%
First workshop, CRM initiative,
whatever the workshops are,

00:42:11.025 --> 00:42:12.900 align:middle line:84%
we give it a name, and
then it's in the file.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.108 align:middle line:90%
So I can click, click, click.

00:42:14.108 --> 00:42:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I can find anything
on my computer.

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, what's the
mother of invention?

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Necessity is the
mother of invention.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So using some
of the techniques

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:84%

you take businesses now

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.900 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.620 align:middle line:84%
But what are you
doing for Amanda?

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:90%
What's your next level?

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:34.790 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Oh my gosh.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a big one.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.485 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: That's a big question.

00:42:37.485 --> 00:42:38.234 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Curveball.

00:42:38.234 --> 00:42:39.539 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:42:39.539 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: No.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything to me is
connecting to that higher

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:84%
purpose, clearing out all
of my ego conversation

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:84%
so that I can be the best
conduit of light and love.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:84%
That is my ultimate,
it's just, it's that.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever I
do outside of that

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:02.390 align:middle line:90%
is just in the flow of serving.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.227 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a yoga
practice every day?

00:43:04.227 --> 00:43:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:05.435 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:43:05.435 --> 00:43:07.000 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: It turns
into anything.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:09.780 align:middle line:90%
It could be--

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, yoga is
breath, alignment, just those

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.070 align:middle line:90%
two things alone.

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll be getting
a drink, and I'll, oh OK,

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm better now.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But then in the morning,
I'll do my Sun Salutation.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when I'm
cooking food, I'll

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:29.150 align:middle line:84%
then turn into a Warrior
One and a Warrior Two.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:32.473 align:middle line:90%
And it'll just--

00:43:32.473 --> 00:43:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I am always doing yoga.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:36.642 align:middle line:84%
It just feels that
it's always that way.

00:43:36.642 --> 00:43:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Always a
part of your life.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you went into a teacher
training of yoga as well.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.187 align:middle line:84%
What did you want
to do with that?

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: At the time,
I couldn't sit still.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:50.096 align:middle line:84%
Which you really can't either
anyway, but it doesn't matter.

00:43:50.096 --> 00:43:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well, I felt that
I needed to be within myself

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:90%
and I needed time to reflect.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very bad
at sitting still.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So to me, yoga teacher
training was, OK,

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.950 align:middle line:84%
this is a healing
modality that I

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:84%
can learn that I can
assist more people with.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:09.092 align:middle line:84%
And it'll help me in
the future, I'm sure.

00:44:09.092 --> 00:44:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I never would've
thought that it would've

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.487 align:middle line:90%
helped me as much as it has.

00:44:12.487 --> 00:44:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you use it?

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:15.257 align:middle line:90%

just for fun though.

00:44:17.911 --> 00:44:19.950 align:middle line:84%
That's like in my
lunch break, I'll

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:23.190 align:middle line:84%
go and help the
80-year-olds at the library

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.000 align:middle line:84%
figure out how to
lift up their arm

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and breathe because it's
so amazing how much breath

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.590 align:middle line:90%
is important in life.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:33.127 align:middle line:84%
And yet people completely are
just not even aware of it.

00:44:33.127 --> 00:44:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's huge.

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:38.210 align:middle line:84%
What about in the beginning
of meetings or your work day?

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:90%
How does that come into play?

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.219 align:middle line:90%
Do you yoga in your meetings?

00:44:41.219 --> 00:44:42.343 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Oh, all the time.

00:44:42.343 --> 00:44:43.045 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:44:43.045 --> 00:44:44.300 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: I've had this
really amazing turn where--

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So as a singer/songwriter,
I would get into the flow,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and it would be this
creative, beautiful movement.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.630 align:middle line:90%
And I dance, too.

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So I would feel it
from dance as well.

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like that was
separate from my business life.

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And I had my businessman hat on.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have
my creative hat on.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
they merged into one.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So now I flow between
an email campaign

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.800 align:middle line:84%
to singing on the piano
to then a yoga pose.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And it just feels
like I'm in the flow,

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and I'm doing them all--

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:17.134 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Constantly.

00:45:17.134 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And then how do the rest
of the people, who've

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.760 align:middle line:84%
been in the business for a
long time, experience that?

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:25.875 align:middle line:90%
That's probably fun.

00:45:25.875 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yeah.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.592 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why
I work from home.

00:45:30.592 --> 00:45:34.370 align:middle line:84%
They can't see the crazy
that happens in my room.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.716 align:middle line:90%
I mean in my office.

00:45:36.716 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:38.131 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:39.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a good way of doing it.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: But I did, at our
most recent headquarter event,

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I cooked everyone this rice
and lentil dish that I cured

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.983 align:middle line:90%
my celiac disease with--

00:45:48.983 --> 00:45:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Or with my guru.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'll put little
things in there.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And I did yoga with
everybody to just get

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.854 align:middle line:84%
them involved in
what that feels like.

00:45:58.854 --> 00:45:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And they all loved it.

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And they all loved the
rice and lentil dish.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's creeping in.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've cured
your own body from that?

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Well, no.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:09.140 align:middle line:90%
With Guruji.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.090 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Asia,
I ate a monotone diet

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of rice and lentils
for six weeks straight.

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.487 align:middle line:84%
And what the doctors had said
I would never cure went away.

00:46:19.487 --> 00:46:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.014 align:middle line:84%
Just by the protein
and the starch and--

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: And the blessings.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every disease is caused
from a dis-ease of our mind.

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:30.720 align:middle line:90%
And Guruji is a beautiful--

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:84%
That's my mentor,
my teacher that

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.980 align:middle line:84%
teaches me to let
go of those things

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.430 align:middle line:90%
so that the physical can happen.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you could probably
teach a version of that

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.812 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:46:40.812 --> 00:46:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: I don't know.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.103 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, a version of that.

00:46:43.103 --> 00:46:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: I mean, it
rebuilt my stomach lining.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:46.380 align:middle line:90%
I had holes.

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.150 align:middle line:90%
I had leaky gut.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So all of my food would
go into my bloodstream,

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
become allergic.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:52.975 align:middle line:84%
So that was a
pretty serious one.

00:46:52.975 --> 00:46:53.475 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:46:53.475 --> 00:46:55.332 align:middle line:84%
But that's amazing
that you then--

00:46:55.332 --> 00:46:56.290 align:middle line:90%
But you just mentioned.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:59.470 align:middle line:84%
You transcend the
physical with the mind.

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes, huge.

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be alive.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.962 align:middle line:90%
I would be in white walls.

00:47:05.962 --> 00:47:10.210 align:middle line:84%
A loony bin, I would be
in a loony bin right now.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:16.119 align:middle line:84%
The mindset, the mindset,
the practice, the meditation.

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:17.785 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this
is another great clip

00:47:17.785 --> 00:47:20.159 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to look at
here with your father talking

00:47:20.159 --> 00:47:23.320 align:middle line:84%
about time management, where
it does come to emails.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is the mindfulness
where it comes back

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.540 align:middle line:90%
into the business practice.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.355 align:middle line:90%
>>CHET HOLMES: Email.

00:47:29.355 --> 00:47:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
email and the concept

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:33.120 align:middle line:84%
of touch it once,
because email can

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:90%
be the death of productivity.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Usually, you must use
really good subject lines

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.610 align:middle line:84%
in your emails
because I don't open

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.960 align:middle line:84%
an email unless I
can deal with it.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.620 align:middle line:90%
So it is absolutely required.

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.020 align:middle line:90%
My staff, back me up.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:47.990 align:middle line:90%
How important is subject lines?

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: You cannot send
me an email without a fantastic

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.960 align:middle line:90%
subject line.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It's got to really
describe what it is.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I insist, by the
way, if the subject changes--

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And they will get
nasty emails from me

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.040 align:middle line:84%
with all capital letters in
the subject line, saying,

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.720 align:middle line:90%
change the subject line to.

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'll put the
new subject line.

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is you'll
get an email, and it'll say,

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I know you wanted to
talk to Bill Johnson.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've set up a meeting
with Bill Johnson.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.900 align:middle line:84%
When did you want
to handle that?

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:90%
So I'll answer back.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Then it'll come back.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the same email, we're
talking about Bill Johnson,

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and it'll say, and by
the way, I got the budget

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.206 align:middle line:90%
for the Tony Robbins' event.

00:48:23.206 --> 00:48:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
see that, let me now.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So then I write back, and I
say, yeah, that'd be good,

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.410 align:middle line:84%
but it still has Bill
Johnson in the subject line.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:30.450 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:31.760 align:middle line:90%
You're all guilty of this.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And then 17 of these
things go back.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.567 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
files has the final.

00:48:35.567 --> 00:48:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I say, I don't need to
see the whole budget,

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.340 align:middle line:84%
just tell me what
the bottom line is.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So one of 17 emails with Bill
Johnson in the subject line

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:43.314 align:middle line:90%
has the budget item.

00:48:43.314 --> 00:48:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So now I need to go
find out what that--

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.313 align:middle line:90%
What was that bottom line again?

00:48:46.313 --> 00:48:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And I'm opening 17 emails.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Happen to anybody here?

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:51.910 align:middle line:90%
So you need to control that.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:52.950 align:middle line:90%
You need to have that.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Anybody I deal with--

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.200 align:middle line:90%
I will teach clients it.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm obnoxious
because I have to be.

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Those emails have to
have great subject lines.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And when the subject changes,
so does the subject line.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Here's a great one.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Unread.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Bring up at weekly meeting.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.025 align:middle line:84%
That's a subject line I
send back with some emails

00:49:13.025 --> 00:49:13.900 align:middle line:90%
because they come in.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.650 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I see it's this big long thing.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have
a weekly meeting,

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to sit there
and write three paragraphs back

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to an email or even
read three paragraphs.

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I will not read a
three paragraph email.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.750 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be a
sentence or two.

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And I will send it back to a
subordinate, saying, unread.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Bring up at weekly meeting.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Because email is there
for my convenience,

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
let it rule my life.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And it tries really hard.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it guys?

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Emails just overwhelm you.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.412 align:middle line:90%
It's so ridiculous.

00:49:43.412 --> 00:49:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So it can be the death
of good time management.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Companies that have
emails constantly

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.830 align:middle line:84%
sounding when they come in put
everyone in a reactive mode,

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:50.820 align:middle line:90%
unless that's your job.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:54.370 align:middle line:84%
You're customer service
for an electronics company,

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:56.017 align:middle line:90%
where you answer emails all day.

00:49:56.017 --> 00:49:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if that's your
job, that's your job.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But supervisors
shouldn't be that.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And I can always tell
when someone is reactive.

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you who on
my staff is reactive

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and who isn't because
the ones who I've highly

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.310 align:middle line:84%
trained over the years,
when you send them an email,

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.110 align:middle line:84%
you don't hear back
from them for two hours

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.927 align:middle line:84%
because it's not in
their schedule yet.

00:50:14.927 --> 00:50:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And I can tell you who they are.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:16.960 align:middle line:90%
I've got some of them.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.085 align:middle line:90%
And they're just like that.

00:50:18.085 --> 00:50:19.130 align:middle line:90%
They're fantastic.

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:20.520 align:middle line:90%
They have their time managed.

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.909 align:middle line:84%
And I, as the
owner, respect that.

00:50:22.909 --> 00:50:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I can tell you
the people who are just--

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:26.830 align:middle line:84%
every time they get an email,
they stop what they're doing,

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and they go and they
answer the email.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:29.670 align:middle line:84%
There was a recent
study done that

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.570 align:middle line:84%
shows that if you let something
interrupt you all the time,

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.040 align:middle line:84%
you lose the ability
to concentrate.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Concentration is like a muscle.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.633 align:middle line:84%
And you strengthen it,
and you strengthen it

00:50:38.633 --> 00:50:39.890 align:middle line:90%
by doing more and more of it.

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:40.806 align:middle line:90%
So boy, I'll tell you.

00:50:40.806 --> 00:50:43.820 align:middle line:84%
When you've got to concentrate,
turn the email off.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Shut it down.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.810 align:middle line:84%
My computer has
this little thing

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.180 align:middle line:84%
that comes up with
these little emails

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.500 align:middle line:84%
in the corner, the
corner of the screen.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.285 align:middle line:90%
Do you have that?

00:50:50.285 --> 00:50:52.076 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing
something else and working

00:50:52.076 --> 00:50:55.567 align:middle line:84%
on this orientation
for this session.

00:50:55.567 --> 00:50:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And those little
emails are coming up.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And I had five days to
do this, I put aside.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And Tony messed with
me all through it,

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.180 align:middle line:90%
just totally destroyed my time.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So the last three
days, basically, I just

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.270 align:middle line:90%
shut off the emails.

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, not going to
respond to this at all.

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So set specific times
to respond to emails.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:14.764 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
in your schedule,

00:51:14.764 --> 00:51:15.680 align:middle line:90%
and then you'll do it.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if you
have a half an hour--

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.300 align:middle line:84%
If you don't set a time,
and you open up your emails,

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.820 align:middle line:84%
you've got 40 emails,
it can take three hours.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you only
have a half an hour,

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:26.288 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing how you will
get through 40 emails

00:51:26.288 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:84%
in a half an hour with one
word answers or unread,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.970 align:middle line:90%
bring up at weekly meeting.

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:35.060 align:middle line:90%
That's my favorite response.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what
we're watching here,

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:40.290 align:middle line:84%
which is an amazing display
of your father's work,

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:42.330 align:middle line:84%
you have provided
for us to give us

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:44.650 align:middle line:84%
kind of an example
of what he taught.

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:46.844 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about this
project for you.

00:51:46.844 --> 00:51:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well,
it was huge for me

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.300 align:middle line:84%
because, originally, we didn't
really serve the entrepreneur.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.050 align:middle line:84%
We didn't serve
the one man army.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And for me--

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What did you serve?

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Bigger
companies that usually

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:04.520 align:middle line:84%
have a sales team or even just
a staff, more established.

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And we realized that
so many entrepreneurs

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:08.400 align:middle line:90%
came knocking on our doors.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And we're like, we're sorry.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.060 align:middle line:90%
We can't help you.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.530 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing we can do here.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So I went about taking all
of my father's content, hours

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:18.280 align:middle line:84%
upon hours, and finding
the best of the best,

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and then chunking into little 5
to 15 minute gems of just gold,

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and putting it all into one
place online that actually

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.460 align:middle line:84%
serves a smaller business
owner and the billionaire,

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.410 align:middle line:84%
because the
billionaires have seen

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:36.000 align:middle line:84%
multiple millions from
watching these videos.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing, but it also
affects an entrepreneur.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I feel so lucky that
I can bring that.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm here
is to take that legacy

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and assist people that
don't know any better,

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:50.310 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to
manage their time.

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And don't know
how to do to-do lists

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and never really were taught
how to work on the business

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.940 align:middle line:90%
rather than in the business.

00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And so is this formed into
what you call the Chet Holmes

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Institute?

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's a
teaching grounds, right?

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yeah.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.875 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For people
to learn from.

00:53:06.875 --> 00:53:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Online
training, like Gaiam TV.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, streaming
online training.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.785 align:middle line:90%
Streaming online inspiration.

00:53:14.785 --> 00:53:17.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
here at one of the last clips

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.830 align:middle line:84%
here about really managing
those to-do lists.

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:21.732 align:middle line:90%
So take a look.

00:53:21.732 --> 00:53:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHET HOLMES: So
here's step number two.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.110 align:middle line:90%
You want to make lists.

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Lists keep you on track.

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Many people make lists as
a way of keeping organized.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.861 align:middle line:90%
Who here makes lists?

00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:32.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Good crowd.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Who here has really long
lists, 24 items, 22 items?

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Let me teach you
a little secret.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.680 align:middle line:84%
You want to have only six
things on your daily list.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You might keep a
side list, like this,

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:47.682 align:middle line:84%
of just a running
tally of things

00:53:47.682 --> 00:53:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that you know you're
going to have to do.

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:51.770 align:middle line:84%
But for the day,
today, you only want

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.380 align:middle line:84%
to have six things
on your schedule.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.600 align:middle line:90%
That's it, just six things.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And they want to be the
most important things

00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.860 align:middle line:90%
that you have to get done.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So step one is to write the
six most important things.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And why only six?

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:06.806 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
have the long lists,

00:54:06.806 --> 00:54:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're not planning
your day, which we're

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.740 align:middle line:84%
going to get into the
nitty-gritty of that,

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.290 align:middle line:84%
what you'll tend to do is
look at the easy stuff.

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:16.330 align:middle line:84%
You get a minute,
go to the list.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:18.060 align:middle line:84%
What can I just
pick off right now?

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And the big things and
the important things, they

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.940 align:middle line:84%
just get pushed off and
pushed off and pushed off.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you start your day with
the six most important things,

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.030 align:middle line:84%
you will have a way
more productive day.

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And if there's only six
and you get all six done,

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a great psychological
impact at the end of the day.

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:37.000 align:middle line:90%
So let's do it right now.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's pretend we're
planning tomorrow.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:39.730 align:middle line:90%
And you're not at the seminar.

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:41.271 align:middle line:84%
And there's six most
important things

00:54:41.271 --> 00:54:44.250 align:middle line:84%
you have to do on Monday when
you get back to the office.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:45.940 align:middle line:90%
And there's only two pages.

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Those two pages are going
to change your life.

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want
you to plan when,

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want you
to plan how much time.

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to write the
six most important things

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:58.023 align:middle line:84%
you have to do on Monday when
you get back to the office.

00:54:58.023 --> 00:55:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if someone
who is watching

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.080 align:middle line:84%
is an entrepreneur, they
want to start a business,

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:19.960 align:middle line:84%
how do they begin, and
how could you help them?

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: I would say, my
father learned everything

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that he charged hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:55:25.850 --> 00:55:28.560 align:middle line:90%
before, he put into a $12 book.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, great.

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: So that's
kind of hard to resist.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.960 align:middle line:90%
That's probably the first step.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, is "The
Ultimate Sales Machine."

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:40.080 align:middle line:84%
After that, if you
want a little more,

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.560 align:middle line:84%
if you want hands-on
help and even more

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to just digest that
information, chetholmes.com

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:51.626 align:middle line:84%
and the institute
will all be there.

00:55:51.626 --> 00:55:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A full,
complete package.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And if there's either personal
coaching or read the book,

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.170 align:middle line:90%
you can do the online.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:56:00.450 align:middle line:84%
But either way, being an
entrepreneur in this day

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and age is an incredibly
essential move,

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.900 align:middle line:84%
even if you have
a full-time job,

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:11.070 align:middle line:84%
you can start a side business
of selling dehydrated fruits

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:13.771 align:middle line:84%
at farmers markets, and
you're an entrepreneur.

00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Everything is sales.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are so many
different ways to sell.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.014 align:middle line:90%
You're selling--

00:56:19.014 --> 00:56:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Your daughter probably sells
you on different things

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:22.470 align:middle line:90%
she wants every day.

00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:24.687 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Negotiates,
that's what she does.

00:56:24.687 --> 00:56:26.395 align:middle line:84%
>>HOLMES: Well, don't
give her that book,

00:56:26.395 --> 00:56:29.310 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure she's
very good already.

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:30.164 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But, yeah.

00:56:30.164 --> 00:56:31.580 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
beautiful things

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:34.264 align:middle line:84%
is you can explore your
passions in any way.

00:56:34.264 --> 00:56:36.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you have
to quit your day job.

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You can stick with what
you do, or it might even

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.110 align:middle line:90%
be what you love.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But even as a student, you
can start something new.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:46.350 align:middle line:84%
You can grow a business
just by participating

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:90%
in farmers markets.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
many different things

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:49.070 align:middle line:90%
that you can do.

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it grows bigger
and bigger and bigger

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's based
on serving people.

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:53.750 align:middle line:90%
So you help people with that.

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOLMES: Yes.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:55.535 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:56:55.535 --> 00:56:59.330 align:middle line:84%

for helping us.
