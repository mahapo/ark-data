00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:84%
broadcasting from the
Sounds True Wake Up Festival

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:84%
in the beautiful
Rockies surrounding

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Estes Park, Colorado.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So, when someone extends their
knowledge to help heal you,

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:84%
you basically want to
spend the rest of your life

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:84%
thanking them in
many, many ways.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
happened with my guest,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:90%
master healer, Robert Peng.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:84%
He was healed from a
childhood heart condition

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
when he was a little
boy, and a qigong master

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
taught him for the
following 13 years

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
how to use life force energy
to restore our inner power.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Robert Peng.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT PENG: Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.928 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, tell me a little
bit about your life growing up

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and your heart condition,
what was that like?

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: I don't know what the
name of that condition is.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:84%
The symptom is that
it's severely painful.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Like if I cough, if I jump,
it is so painful that I cannot

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:90%
breathe.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So, my mother brought me to the
doctor, and tried to heal it,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't work.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And how old were you?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: I was 7, 8--
yeah, about 8 years old.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So, it's my second year
at the primary school.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:90%
It took a few months.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Then the doctor
couldn't help-- well,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
the only thing he can suggest
is, well, maybe your son

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
needs to take a break, to rest
at home, not to run around.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, my mother took the
advice, then I stayed at home.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But when they went out to work,
and my brothers and sisters,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
they went out, and all the other
neighbors, they're all gone,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:90%
I was by myself.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
For two days, I'm OK,
but the third day,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
I was so bored, so I sneak
out, just play on the ground.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.086 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:01:56.086 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: 'Cause our building is--
it stood near the countryside,

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
so there's a lot of
mountains, some wild grass.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I got a lot of
wild strawberries.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: It's not fun.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.652 align:middle line:84%
I watched more than
40 kinds of ants.

00:02:13.652 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is where
you grew up in China?

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yes, how I
grew up in China, yeah.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.763 align:middle line:84%
Then, not far from my
home is a resort hotel.

00:02:22.763 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: That
hotel-- in China, we

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
like to have walls-- so
it's surrounded by the wall,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.955 align:middle line:84%
and we, children, were not
allowed to get into it freely.

00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So they had
the door keeper.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So normally-- not only when I
was at that time-- normally we

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of kids in a
building-- and other buildings

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:84%
too-- if we want to go
there, we climb over the wall

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.596 align:middle line:90%
and jump into it.

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And we
have some fun time.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.102 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:51.435 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: But now, just me alone--

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --I climb over the
wall, jump into it-- so painful,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't care because
I know how wonderful

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
it was afterwards. 'Cause
they have fruit trees.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:90%
They have swimming pool.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:90%
It is like a wonderland--

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.217 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:07.175 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: --compared to--

00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:08.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where you lived?

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --the other
side, outside.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, inside that
building-- that

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.114 align:middle line:84%
resort-- there's a small
building is called boiler room.

00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The boiler room, OK.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yeah, it's about
the same size as this room.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:90%
They have two huge furnaces.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Then they
have water tank,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
then you have fire
to boil the water.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they supply the
hot water for all the guest

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:90%
rooms.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.773 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The hotel, uh huh.

00:03:34.773 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yeah, for steam,
for the rice in the kitchen.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.035 align:middle line:84%
And so I went there--
we went there before--

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --but this is
more so the other way.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But this time I went there,
the boiler room attendant

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:90%
was there working.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.490 align:middle line:90%
So I was peeping from the door.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And he saw me, and said,
you want to watch the fire?

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I think I was not the only boy
who liked to peep, and-- fire.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Because when the flame
glows, blows that fire,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.016 align:middle line:90%
I can watch the fire for hours.

00:04:08.016 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:90%
It's like meditation.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.598 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: So, it was all fun.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, come in and watch it.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Don't get burnt.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So I watched the fire, of
course we chat a little bit.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards he said, feel
free to come, we have time.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I was joking,
'cause he didn't

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.192 align:middle line:90%
know that I was school-free.

00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He didn't ask you
or anything, he just like--

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: I came every day.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.624 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And actually,
after a couple of days,

00:04:35.624 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:90%
he began to tell me stories.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:90%
He's a wonderful storyteller.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.486 align:middle line:84%
So later, I came here more for
the story than for the fire.

00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Stories
of his childhood?

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Stories about anything.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, story about Monkey King.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Story about-- well, some of
his stories, he didn't tell

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.611 align:middle line:90%
is his story.

00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Because he's
a Buddhist monk.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, he was my first master.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.885 align:middle line:90%
Actually, he my main master.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:90%
He was my healer.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, how did he discover
you had a heart condition,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:90%
and how did he heal that?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, when we chat--
he asked me why I was away,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
then they told me I
have heart conditions.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, well-- he didn't
even tell me he treated me.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But two weeks later,
it disappeared

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:84%
without my noticing,
because my mother

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.195 align:middle line:84%
was so worried, she'd
say, how is that?

00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: I don't know.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.356 align:middle line:84%
You're so used to the pain,
and when it disappears,

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:90%
you forget it was there.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're so
happy that it's gone.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.351 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:05:39.351 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do remember him doing
anything specifically to you?

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:90%
An energy work, or--

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, he put
his hands on my chest--

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: --tap on my top head.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, now I know
what it means, yeah.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Because top head
and the perineum,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:84%
here, there's a channel
called central meridian.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So he'd tap it;
it's empowering the energy.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's more
concentrated over there.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the technique
I'm teaching now.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, he didn't tell me, yeah.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Well his power-- his like--
he looks so ordinary--

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Like, middle-aged
person-- he was 80 already.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: He looked like
middle-aged person.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.412 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: And not muscular.

00:06:21.412 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Working in
the boiler room.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And when he shoveled the
coal in, it is so graceful.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like dancing.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.754 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And so, later, when
all of a sudden-- actually, two

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
or three weeks
later-- he said, do

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
you like to learn some Kung--
like, Kung Fu in China, we say,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
wushu.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:90%
You like some wushu?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yes, of course.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: I like wushu,
but nobody can teach me.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to teach you.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.929 align:middle line:90%
You can?

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
big honor, isn't it?

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, I didn't
know at that time.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.314 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: I was just thinking
he's a boiler room attendant.

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:90%
He's like hermit.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew he was a senior
monk in the deep mountain

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.436 align:middle line:90%
and a legendary healer.

00:07:03.436 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Mastery of martial arts.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:84%
He can disable like, a wild bull
just with his bare hand, ka!

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: To freeze, yeah.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: 'Cause later, I know
the story that the villages,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.896 align:middle line:90%
when I visit him--

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:18.396 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --would tell, 'cause
the wild bulls, they get wild.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So he was asked to freeze
them, then heal the bull.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.303 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:07:26.303 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So he does-- he teaches me,
I say, oh, can you teach me?

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.594 align:middle line:90%
Keep secret, keep discipline.

00:07:33.594 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so those were the
two rules you had to follow?

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: His two rules, yeah.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Keep it secret--

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yeah, because it's peak
time of cultural revolution.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, mhm.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.295 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: At that time, the
religions were banned.

00:07:45.295 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: That's the reason he was
driven out of this monastery,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
actually wandered around a river
to find a job in my hometown,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.590 align:middle line:90%
far away from his monastery.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.179 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:07:58.179 --> 00:07:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah--

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: It is very
humble, low-pay job.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
He has a million reason
to be angry and upset,

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
but you never see him
complain anything.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because he was
driven out of his homeland.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yes, he was
an orphan, so he

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
has no way to visit
his relatives.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: So that is his home.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
His home is in the
boiler room, too.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
In the corner is the mosquito
screen, that's where he stayed.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, when he said,
I will teach you,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and-- well, first of
all, what did your mother

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
say when your
condition was healed?

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did she ask you where
you've been, or how you did it,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:90%
or, it was just--

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, when I knew that
the pain is no more-- of course

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
we still don't know
it's healed already,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
it's just, oh, maybe for this
moment, but it will come again.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So, it was
like a few months later

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
we know it's totally
healed, yeah.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But after a few weeks, I began
to practice on the ground.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.527 align:middle line:84%
I was so good to keep
secret, even from my parents.

00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you left your house
at, what, 5:00 in the morning,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
every morning, and--

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.884 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: That's right.

00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So my parents,
after a few weeks,

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:90%
my mother was bit worried.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
They said, what on earth are
you doing every morning--

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Whare are you going?

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.203 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --at 5 o'clock
in the morning,

00:09:17.203 --> 00:09:19.541 align:middle line:84%
and disappear for a few
hours, coming home hungry.

00:09:19.541 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Heh.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.581 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:84%
As a little boy, you want
to be lazy in the bed.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:90%
So, I said, oh, I was jogging.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I have to lie at first,
because I want to keep secret.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And then, I
told my master, I said,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:90%
well, my parents get concerned.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: He thought a
little while, said, ask

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.326 align:middle line:84%
your parents come
to see me tonight.

00:09:41.326 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Then I told-- I went
back home and told my parents,

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and say-- well, at that time
his name is Tan, Master Tan--

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --is his
name as a worker.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, Master Tan
wants to see you.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:84%
They were very confused,
why he wants to see us?

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: They know about him
as a boiler room attendant--

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.035 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --because it's
so far, sometimes they

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:05.631 align:middle line:90%
go there to get hot water.

00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.526 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The villagers?

00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And, I don't know,
they asked, just go.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So, my parents visited him, and
they were in the boiler room,

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
I was outside waiting.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.676 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: A couple of hours,
they got out, excited,

00:10:22.676 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:90%
a little bit nervous.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:84%
They were like, keep
going on with Master Tan.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Keep going on with Master Tan.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.479 align:middle line:90%
We keep secret for you, too.

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Whoa.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.661 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Because if we were
caught, he might get into jail.

00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.535 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: If we were
caught that we

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:90%
practice the traditional things.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Because we
have to burn incense,

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.221 align:middle line:84%
which was not
allowed at that time.

00:10:42.221 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Strange now.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
We tell the young
people now in China,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.534 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't believe how
strict, how funny it was.

00:10:48.534 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, I would
have never thought

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:90%
of that, just burning incense.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So he started to
impart his teachings on you,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:90%
but how did it start?

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, the first-- well,
I started with martial art,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:90%
not healing arts yet.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So the martial arts, the
first thing he asked me to do

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.036 align:middle line:90%
is Horse Stance.

00:11:07.036 --> 00:11:09.255 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Horse Stance, like
you're riding horse,

00:11:09.255 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:84%
then you bend the knees, upper
body straight, you hold arms.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:90%
If you try it, half a minute--

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your legs start to burn.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.305 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --your thighs,
they burn like charcoal.

00:11:17.305 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: 20 minutes
I was [STRUGGLING]

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Sweat, cry, actually.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:90%
20 minutes, finished.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow, every day, 20 minutes.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: I hated it at first.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Until, like a few weeks later,
one day I was standing there,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Horse Stance, expecting
horrible things,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
tiring things to happen.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I feel as if someone

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%

my master was very happy.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.767 align:middle line:84%

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.172 align:middle line:84%

>>PENG: Much later.

00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
That was when the cultural

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.665 align:middle line:84%
But three years
later, he was called

00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%

the monastery.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So before that, we were

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:90%

So, I was like leading two
lives, my life with him,

00:13:09.892 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and the other life is my
school-- life in a school.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is like a movie.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.775 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is your life.

00:13:15.775 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:90%

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.515 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, how many
years of your life

00:13:18.515 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
did you spend with
him as a child?

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, '72 to--
he passed away '85.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So '72 since '79, we
were together almost

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.510 align:middle line:90%
every time, every day.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Then after '79 he went back.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:84%
It is far, deep
in the mountains.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I have to take like
eight hours train--

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.414 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: --to the monastery.

>>PENG: Yeah.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was after that--
because later-- well, I

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:84%
want to cut story short-- I was
involved with a street fight.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Then I
was so regretting,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:90%
my master was so angry--

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --then I didn't
like fight at all.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Because, at first, you
learn some martial arts--

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.151 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --he told me how to
use the broomstick as a weapon.

00:14:14.151 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: You go like this.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.017 align:middle line:90%
Bang, yeah.

00:14:17.017 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Chopstick, you can stab.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So all these kind of things
in your daily life as weapon,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:90%
then you feel like to fight.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But once I got
involved with a fight,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I don't feel
the triumph at all.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Although I defeated
three of them,

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
but I don't feel-- I don't have
the sense of victory, you know.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Actually, at that time,
when I saw that guy,

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.822 align:middle line:90%
I thought I killed him.

00:14:41.822 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
But later, I went
to hospital, he's

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:84%
OK-- I was so frightened the
policemen would come and arrest

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
me, and kill me--
shot me-- when I

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:84%
saw him, he was
so intimidated, so

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.162 align:middle line:84%
frightened when I
entered the ward.

00:14:54.162 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And I said, well, that

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:90%
I was treating him like monster.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:90%
I was just, like, killing him.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.489 align:middle line:84%

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:84%
Two days to decide
which you want to do.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm all willing to guide you.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, I say,
I don't want to wait.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I go the healing.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You decided instantly?

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.005 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Oh yes.

00:17:34.005 --> 00:17:35.749 align:middle line:84%
I already regret,
so much, fighting.

00:17:35.749 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And also--
occasionally he

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
does the healing
for some neighbors--

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.685 align:middle line:84%
I can see how
grateful people is.

00:17:43.685 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Helpful, yes.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.726 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: How beautiful it is.

00:17:45.726 --> 00:17:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Like, with the energy.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:90%
I admire it.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.707 align:middle line:84%
Well, occasionally he
asked me to assist.

00:17:51.707 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:90%
He'd go, press this point.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Send the chi there.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
So I like, sparely.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So now I say, I don't want to
wait, I want to do the healing.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK, good.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So he began to teach me
how to conduct energies,

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's not too
far that he began

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the monastery,
and I began to visit him.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, not every day now, maybe
twice a year, or once a year.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: It was over there he
began to conduct that 100 days

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.887 align:middle line:90%
water fast for me.

00:18:20.887 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that was
a choice for you?

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.629 align:middle line:84%
Did he give you
the option to do--

00:18:24.629 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: No options.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No option, OK.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.771 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:18:26.771 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, he knew-- because
normally, when I go there,

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
it's about a month's time,
because I have school.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But that was when I finished
my primary-- my junior high

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:90%
school.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a long time,
nearly four months' break.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I went there,
I was expecting, like before,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of fun
time, leisure time.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
He said, now is the
time you do Big One.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Big One is that special
name of 100 day water fast.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:90%
And then I said, whoa!

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: I know what it is,
he mentioned it before,

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't--

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --know he was
going to arrange that time.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Then it is at the
basement of the temple.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're winding the way
to that, we're going down,

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:90%
and he--

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you have
any days to decide this?

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:84%
He just said, this
is what you're doing?

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: This is
what you're doing.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Go, tonight.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Tonight, OK.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So, he had a
candle, and we walk inside,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:90%
the there's a room there.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
On the side is room for,
like, toilet things.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Cushion, and the altar,
then he burned the incense,

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
begin to guide me the
meditation and practice.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:84%
About an hour time,
ready, he left.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:84%
The only light I could see was
the-- like, the lit incense.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.156 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, mm.

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: A few hours
later, it vanishes.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's gone.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Pitch dark, yeah.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:90%
He came to visit me every day.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For an hour--

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.135 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah, for guiding--

00:19:57.135 --> 00:19:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --or so?

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.851 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: --me.

00:19:57.851 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, each time he came, he
had incense lit already--

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: --coming in.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:84%
He's talking with the darkness,
with the little incense,

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of practices.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, all in the pitch dark.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.815 align:middle line:84%
Then he has three dates
that read [CHINESE SPOKEN]

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: The Chinese dates in
his hands for the first 20 days.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:84%
One date's for milk, there
are three dates a day.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: That's first 20 days.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.409 align:middle line:90%
After that it's just pure water.

00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Pure water.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Pure water.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.375 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was your biggest
struggle in the beginning?

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:35.509 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Well, a lot.

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Because this is
like a few lives experience.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:45.330 align:middle line:84%
We have the sense-- well first,
physically, we have each in us,

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
we have the pain, we
feel the coldness,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:84%
the heat-- every
meditation we go deep.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.236 align:middle line:84%
One of them, we call
it Devil, yeah--

00:20:55.236 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: --will come,
and you feel hot,

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
then burning hot until you
feel like you could burn.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Or cold, freezing cold, the
bones were like crinkling.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: The hardest one
for me is the itchiness,

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:90%
you feel like millions of ants--

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: --are biting on you.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:17.217 align:middle line:84%
But when you open your
eyes, they're disappeared.

00:21:17.217 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They're not there.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: But you have
to climb up again,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
until you really go over that--
cross the mountain, Nirvana.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So beautiful you
don't want to return.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it is like every
hair was standing with joy.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yeah, it
feels so wonderful.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So, we are
experiencing physical,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:90%
all those things to the extreme.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So one is like a
lifetime experience.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wow, so that's what
you mean by many lifetimes

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.519 align:middle line:90%
you experienced in that.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Before that is the
fear, the loneliness.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So for the first, like,
months, it's quite struggling.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But because he comes
to see me every day,

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:90%
that make it a lot easier.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.569 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:22:06.569 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.318 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you look forward
to that visit every day.

00:22:09.318 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Oh, of course, yeah.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, 'cause there's special
practices, it's movement,

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and some of them is
very special breathing.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And about 2/3 of the time, for
about eight days, my breathing

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.655 align:middle line:90%
is getting so slow.

00:22:26.655 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And normally we would do two
or three breathing a minute.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.959 align:middle line:84%
That might be one
breath an hour.

00:22:31.959 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:90%
So you'd lose the--

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.918 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: If you feel the
breathing, I'm a dead person.

00:22:35.918 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So we called
it small death.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Small death.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, it is very
critical at that moment,

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:84%
you need a master that helps
to boost you to go through

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.140 align:middle line:90%
the crisis--

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: --of, like, rebirth.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So a Small
Death, big life.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So, after that, your life
is so totally transformed

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
in a super-high
level-- spirituality,

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
you have physical power--
because at the end, when

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I finished this-- you
know, 100 day, no food,

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I was not losing
too much weight.

want to run in the mountains,
just constantly, nonstop

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Did you
make a commitment,

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:84%
in that time, to move forward
with your life as a healer,

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:90%
to help people?

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Did you make any
decisions at that time?

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yes.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, for sure.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But at that time,
I think my master,

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:84%
he had a vision that I
might be here someday.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

Yeah, no matter where.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was a
senior high school,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:90%
he had a serious talk with me.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, all my
disciples are mountaineers.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:90%
They are not very well educated.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't care what
education-- or what subject you

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
choose, science or social
science, but make sure

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
you go to have
university education,

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:90%

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe don't
know the background.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:84%
At that time, going to
the university for us

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.585 align:middle line:90%
is huge competition.

00:25:13.585 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:84%

No, you're not going

I can major English

00:25:48.702 --> 00:25:51.740 align:middle line:90%
for my university.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.615 align:middle line:90%
And I pass the exam.

00:25:53.615 --> 00:25:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I enter the university.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I majored English

we call it upper dantian--
upper elixir filled.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Because my
qigong is called

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:84%
elixir light--
elixir light qigong.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we practice,
we use a lot of light

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of pearls, elixir.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So, the energy here, when
it's healthy and strong,

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:90%
we are guided.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.802 align:middle line:90%
This is collections of wisdom.

00:29:29.802 --> 00:29:30.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:29:30.385 --> 00:29:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yeah, so upper
dantian is strong and healthy,

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.380 align:middle line:84%
you make good decisions,
you make good choices.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.671 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yeah, you don't
have to be logical,

00:29:37.671 --> 00:29:39.205 align:middle line:90%
but you just instinctively--

00:29:39.205 --> 00:29:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.337 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: --you are wise.

00:29:41.337 --> 00:29:41.836 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:29:41.836 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Then here, through the practice,
you empower the energy here.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:84%
When it is healthy
and it's strong,

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:53.770 align:middle line:84%
you are a loving person, and
you feel loved well, too.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.129 align:middle line:84%
Because some people, they
project a lot of love.

00:29:56.129 --> 00:29:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: They don't feel loved.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.060 align:middle line:90%
This both sides.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.745 align:middle line:84%
The moment that you
project your love,

00:30:01.745 --> 00:30:03.390 align:middle line:90%
you feel the loving coming back.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.892 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you're
wearing the Buddha heart.

00:30:05.892 --> 00:30:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, nice.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:07.631 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But if it's weak there,
that Buddha heart

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.482 align:middle line:90%
becomes a glass heart.

00:30:12.482 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, easily broken.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.856 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Broken easily, yeah.

00:30:14.856 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:84%
It was broken heart,
or stone heart.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Stopping, and
always criticizing

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.072 align:middle line:90%
yourself or others, yeah.

00:30:21.072 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's important
to have the energy flowing.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Yeah, energy flow that
melts all that kind of tension

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and ice away, then you
feel warm and home.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Then the other energy
center, we call it vitality.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Lower dantian is the
center of vitality.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: This gives you
the vitality and health.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Sexual
power, birth power,

they're concentrated here.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.695 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So when you're strong
here, you're charismatic,

00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:48.774 align:middle line:90%
you're very sexy.

00:30:48.774 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you have good figures.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.981 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lots of vitality.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.265 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Because they're born
with a lot of vitality chi,

00:31:00.265 --> 00:31:02.080 align:middle line:84%
because they associate
with the kidneys.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.944 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So, they
don't feel tired.

00:31:04.944 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
When they feel
tired, they sleep--

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: But if we just
practices this alone,

there's one problem,
it doesn't harmonize.

00:31:17.506 --> 00:31:18.005 align:middle line:90%

>>PENG: Yeah.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, that is central meridian.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:84%
That is fourth energy center,
we call it wheel of harmony.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: The center meridian

dantians, shooting
up into the sky

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.480 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: OK.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:84%

through the universe.

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.203 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Because if you're
just using your own chi,

00:32:10.203 --> 00:32:11.650 align:middle line:90%
you'll get exhausted quickly.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

>>LISA: OK.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: And balanced.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.993 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going to take
a look at some of the videos

00:32:26.993 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that Robert has done where he's
demonstrating qigong and some

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.560 align:middle line:90%
of these dantians.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And this one here is
called "Four Wheels."

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG (VOICEOVER): Now,
let's summarize all of this.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
There are four energy
centers in our body.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
the upper dantian,

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of your head,
which stores your wisdom chi.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
It is associated with
your power to guide.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And the complex that
houses the upper dantian

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.750 align:middle line:90%
is named The Wheel of Wisdom.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
the middle dantian,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of your chest,
which stores your love chi.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:10.710 align:middle line:84%
It is associated with
your power to love.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And the complex that
houses the middle dantian

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:90%
is named The Wheel of Love.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:84%
The third one is
the lower dantian,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of your
lower abdomen, which

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:90%
stores your vitality chi.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.040 align:middle line:84%
It is associated with
your power to manifest.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And the complex that
houses the low dantian

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.240 align:middle line:90%
is named The Wheel of Vitality.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth one is
the central meridian

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that runs through all
your three dantians

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and connects you with
heaven chi and Earth's chi.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It is associated with
your power to harmonize.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And the central meridian is
also named The Wheel of Harmony.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, these
four energy complexes

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:84%
are known as The
4 Golden Wheels.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:84%
When all four golden wheels
are running smoothly,

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:84%
you are driving a super
powerful 4-wheel drive,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
and you can draw on
abundant energetic resources

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:18.480 align:middle line:84%
to overcome the bumps on the
road and lead a happy life.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Leading a happy life is the
goal of qigong practice.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And the way to
accomplish this objective

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.909 align:middle line:84%
is to develop The
4 Golden Wheels.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:84%
As we become more
balanced and integrated,

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:90%
so does the rest of our life.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, now that we've
seen a little bit of that,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:84%
of the energy in
the video, let me

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.310 align:middle line:90%
ask you, what is the master key?

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.750 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you talk about
in your teaching of the master

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:90%
key?

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: The master
key is the master key

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:90%
for our dynamic happiness.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, I named
it dynamic happiness

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.160 align:middle line:84%
because when we say
happiness, actually it's

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:90%
more or less about joy.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.656 align:middle line:84%
Like you have a piece of
chocolate, you're happy, right?

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: You play with that.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's the energy
in between your hands.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.486 align:middle line:84%
So first, you can
rub your hands.

00:40:28.486 --> 00:40:28.985 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:28.985 --> 00:40:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Rub your hands.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Then you hold your hands
in front of your body.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, from the rubbing
you feel your hands--

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tingling, yeah.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you can move your hands
together, and move away.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.125 align:middle line:84%
Feel in-- like pressure in
between your hands, changing.

00:40:49.125 --> 00:40:51.640 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:84%
All right, put
your hands closer.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:56.905 align:middle line:90%
The other hand's close.

00:40:56.905 --> 00:40:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:58.302 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:40:58.302 --> 00:41:00.705 align:middle line:84%
You feel the pressure
moving your left hand away--

00:41:00.705 --> 00:41:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:84%

>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And then push the other
hands away, because it waves.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It pushes it out--

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.421 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:41:08.421 --> 00:41:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --by itself, yes.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.005 align:middle line:90%

There's a few waves of this,
you make the connections

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.140 align:middle line:90%
of the energy of your palm.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Then you put it aside.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to the
middle of your palm.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Like there's a
tiny spot of light.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.000 align:middle line:84%

until it is all the way
to reach to your palm.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.669 align:middle line:84%
Now you're holding
the ball now--

00:41:50.669 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.626 align:middle line:84%

You can move it in a circle.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.440 align:middle line:84%
You can move it close to your
third eyes, to your heart.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:90%

Well, the central meridian,
just now I explain,

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.930 align:middle line:84%
it's playing, actually,
quite important role

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.430 align:middle line:90%

So the central meridian, one
is harmonize through energy

centers, and also it's connected
to the universal energy.

>>PENG: Yeah.

00:47:09.731 --> 00:47:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So, you pay attention to your
lower dantian-- that is like,

three fingers below, three
or four fingers below,

Imagine that vitality
chi, that energy,

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:23.780 align:middle line:84%
form a pearl-- because this
is a breathing meditation.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So in inhale, you
bring that pearl up

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:30.040 align:middle line:84%
to your middle dantian--
which is loving chi,

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.590 align:middle line:84%
you have loving chi--
exhale, bring it back.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:38.300 align:middle line:84%

about how to use our energy,
how to use our life force.

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:middle line:84%
You're actually able to change
the consistency of brandy

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.569 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
it taste different.

00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I'm thinking you
could also use this with water,

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.650 align:middle line:84%
if there's not a clean
water source around you.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Explain it.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Oh yes, yes.

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, in China, the
tap water is not drinkable;

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.560 align:middle line:90%
it is not clean enough.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.415 align:middle line:90%
So we always buy the water.

00:52:34.415 --> 00:52:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.581 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:52:35.581 --> 00:52:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Even now, my wife

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:39.850 align:middle line:84%
to have boiled water
instead of tap water.

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: But many times,
we have the occasion

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have bottled
water, only tap water,

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.555 align:middle line:84%
in order to make it
energetically protect us,

00:52:50.555 --> 00:52:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I use this technique
when I'm drinking

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.531 align:middle line:84%
tap water, which is
considered not drinkable.

00:52:56.531 --> 00:52:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: Well, this is
like energy blessing.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:04.725 align:middle line:84%
You might have some friends,
they go to the church.

00:53:04.725 --> 00:53:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh huh.

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:06.485 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: And they
bring a souvenir,

00:53:06.485 --> 00:53:07.905 align:middle line:90%
and say, well this is blessed.

00:53:07.905 --> 00:53:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The holy water, yes.

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PENG: Yeah.

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually,
because we don't say it

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:15.340 align:middle line:84%
in a religious way, that
is the blessed thing,

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.760 align:middle line:84%
that is how you
bless the things.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PENG: So each time, before I
start a meal, I put my hands--

>>PENG: I bless my chi
to the meal, I eat it.

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So, definitely, of course,
you can do it with water,

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.510 align:middle line:90%
with drinks, with--

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:30.070 align:middle line:90%

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.850 align:middle line:90%

coming into the water and
making this water healing.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:21.450 align:middle line:90%

>>PENG: --in China

Because in China, we like
fish, but whole fish.

00:54:35.474 --> 00:54:37.015 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how small, how big.

00:54:37.015 --> 00:54:37.598 align:middle line:90%

or girls when they're
small-- but it gets stuck.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And many people, they say, well,
you can swallow rice, and press

it down, or you drink vinegar.

I think this energy
I put in the water is

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.180 align:middle line:90%
going to melt the bones.

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.320 align:middle line:90%

Oh my goodness.

From now on, I am going to

>>PENG: Yes, yes.

One thing we do

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.720 align:middle line:84%
happen with some of my friends,
to help them to quit smoking.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.855 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes they
take cigarette and say,

00:56:13.855 --> 00:56:14.821 align:middle line:90%
I hate to smoke.

00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:16.320 align:middle line:84%

Instead of blessing to make it
taste beautiful, or healing,

you know, smells terrible.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.910 align:middle line:90%
