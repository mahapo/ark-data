00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Today, I invite you to go on
a journey of consciousness

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.620 align:middle line:84%
with me, guided by my guest,
new generation thought

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:90%
leader, Panache Desai.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Panache has been on an
extraordinary journey himself,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle line:84%
from being raised in
London and recognized

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
as a gifted healer at an early
age and then being on Oprah

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and becoming a worldwide
messenger of truth.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And today, he's going to
help us with a lot of truth.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PANACHE DESAI:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure, as always.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's great
to have you here,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and just to have you
with me in person.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I was saying that
to your earlier.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: I know.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So--

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Pinch me.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Look, you're in the flesh today.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: There you go.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.691 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is exciting.

00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: We're doing it.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk a
little bit about your journey,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about your story
of life as a child for you.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Was it different?

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.475 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a different
experience as a child?

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:01.975 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Life as a child for
me, in a word, was interesting.

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:10%
I was born into a
spiritual family.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:10%
And they weren't religious,
but they were meditators.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:90%
And they chanted in Sanskrit.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.407 align:middle line:84%
Sanskrit's a
vibrational language.

00:01:10.407 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Quite often?

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.781 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Mhm.

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And so we grew up
with this practice

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:10%
that was at the foundation or
the core of our family life.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:10%
And so for the first five
years, my grandmother raised me.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.684 align:middle line:84%
And like every day, she'd
be doing her prayers.

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, she'd be
chanting in Sanskrit.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.974 align:middle line:84%
You know, she'd read
the Bhagavad Gita,

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
which is a wonderful
story in Sanskrit that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
annotates our journey
as individuals

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:90%
into the fullness of who we are.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.431 align:middle line:84%
You know, and this
is the environment

00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:84%
that I grew up in, an absolutely
pristine vibration environment.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.821 align:middle line:84%
I subsequently was completely
open, completely aware

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and connected to
everything and everybody.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By the ways
you were raised.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you would start off
with chanting in the morning

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And just your day
would be about prayer and--

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: The whole day.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --journey.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's it.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, and even
when I got upset,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.244 align:middle line:84%
they'd put me in the meditation
room, and I'd stop crying.

00:01:58.244 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was just
my favorite place to be.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.097 align:middle line:90%
It was home for me.

00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, the energy of
that room was home for me.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most kids you put
in the meditation room,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:90%
they would start crying.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.492 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when
you went to school,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.364 align:middle line:84%
did you have a
similar experience

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:90%
where you carried that over?

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.037 align:middle line:84%
Or was it difficult
when you were

00:02:12.037 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:90%
interacting with the other kids?

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, as I
got older, I began

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:90%
to realize that I was different.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.762 align:middle line:84%
But I made myself
wrong for that.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was really
feeling everything

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.803 align:middle line:90%
that everyone was going through.

00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I was very acutely
aware of-- I mean,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I knew everything
about everybody,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and things I didn't
even want to know.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.515 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And it was
hard for me to navigate

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that, especially in
the teenage years,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.416 align:middle line:84%
because we get to
a point where we

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
want to assert our
dominance, especially boys.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I didn't
want any part of that.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I just went out with all
the nice-looking girls

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.448 align:middle line:84%
while everyone was
beating each other up.

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So that made me a
bit of a target.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.649 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
that I didn't subscribe

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:90%
to this click mentality.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so you
didn't try to fit in?

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: No, I was
this lone island

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.295 align:middle line:90%
by myself, which didn't help.

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Because I just
didn't conform to any group.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.554 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel the need
to conform to any group.

00:02:54.554 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:90%
You know, I loved everybody.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.074 align:middle line:90%
I was just a part of everyone.

00:02:57.074 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I didn't hang
out with the Indian kids.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.141 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hang out
with the athletes.

00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't hanging out with
all the academic kids.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:90%
I knew everybody.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that was how I conducted
myself in school and my life.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So just a second
though-- because you

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:90%
said an island.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So you just kind of went between
all these different groups.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But you were OK with who
you were and who you are.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Exactly.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is one of the
biggest challenges for people

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: It is.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that they're
trying to fit in,

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and they get
rejected, and fit in,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and get rejected, and fit
in, and get rejected, all

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:90%
throughout their whole life.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.477 align:middle line:84%
And it creates dissonance,
huge in the heart.

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.018 align:middle line:84%
It's because most people
are living their lives

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:84%
outside in instead
of inside out.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.532 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Their
informing themselves

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
through the voices
of other people

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and through the approval or
disapproval of other people

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
instead of really being anchored
in the knowledge and wisdom

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.621 align:middle line:84%
of who they are at the
deepest level, which

00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
is just an infinite
divine being.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you
think that it was

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
your teachings and your
growing up through the chanting

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
process, or was there really
gifts that came in with you?

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Which?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Chicken or egg?

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: I was
really born this way.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.368 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Before I was born,
I was blessed in the womb

00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:03.895 align:middle line:84%
by an Indian saint and was
part of a whole lineage.

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And everyone that we'd go
and see on the weekends--

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
when you're Indian, you go to
see Bollywood movies or you go

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:90%
see spiritual teachers.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And everyone that we'd
go and see would say,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
we've been waiting for you.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're here to
shift the consciousness

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.310 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.435 align:middle line:90%
We've been waiting for you.

00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:90%
You have our blessing.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
When you're older,
come and see me.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:90%
And this was this running joke.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It was like everyone
that we'd go and see

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
would have the
same conversation.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I just
wanted to be a kid.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.657 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to watch
Airwolf or The A-Team

00:04:26.657 --> 00:04:29.883 align:middle line:84%
and hang out with BA Baracus,
who was my guru, you know?

00:04:29.883 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: You know, and just
normal, whatever that means.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I had this
whole spiritual thing

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and this whole
spiritual back story

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that was always a
part of my childhood.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you always heard it.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:90%
It was always--

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did somebody keep
reminding of you of it?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.187 align:middle line:90%
Did you try to deny it?

00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Did you want--

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: I absolutely
tried to deny it.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.049 align:middle line:84%
I moved away from
spirituality in my teens

00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
because I just got
to the point where

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what to do with
everything that I was feeling,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
both inside myself
and everywhere else.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think at some point, I
bought into the judgment too.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's very easy
to buy into the judgment

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have as a society of how
people are supposed to show up

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and how we're supposed
to navigate our emotions.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I stepped away from what
I call my soul signature, which

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.883 align:middle line:90%
is my own unique expression.

00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:13.466 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how did
that work for you?

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: It was awful.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.442 align:middle line:90%
It was awful.

00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:17.358 align:middle line:84%
I literally got to a
point where I just really

00:05:17.358 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be on
the planet anymore.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.042 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just crying
myself to sleep most nights.

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Didn't tell my mom
and dad nothing.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I was just in this anguish,
in this existential anguish

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
that, of course, I didn't
understand at that time.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was something
wrong with the version

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:90%
of reality that was being sold.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you
didn't ever register

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.081 align:middle line:84%
that it was something
wrong with you?

00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Huh.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Throughout all the--

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.955 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Even
though people tried

00:05:39.955 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
to make it about me-- and of
course, judgment does that.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, I never
really questioned myself.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.816 align:middle line:84%
I always understood
that I was who I was.

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
the acceptance

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
of who I was that I came
back to being my expression

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and living my soul signature.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was there a
moment of realization

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:84%
that you had that took you
out of that place of crisis?

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Oh, yeah.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:90%
I was very skeptical.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Because being Indian, you meet
lots of people who wear orange.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone's
really taking you

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.689 align:middle line:84%
anywhere that's leading
you to liberation.

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Some people take you
down a garden path.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very
skeptical of everything.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I never believed anything
that anyone told me.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I had to experience
it for myself.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And so even with all these
conversations with people

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:84%
having about me, I
just like, yeah, right.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.585 align:middle line:90%
Leave me alone.

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Why would God choose
somebody like me?

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:90%
And so for me, I called out God.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:90%
I said, all right.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:84%
If you exist, then
prove it to me.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not going
to be this messenger

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.229 align:middle line:84%
that everyone says
I'm here to be.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And if I can't look at
people in their eyes

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and tell them that this is the
truth based on my experience,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:90%
then I won't do it.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I had an
experience of the divine.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.077 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, was the moment
where the skepticism ended.

00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What was the experience?

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Just this
infinite ocean

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.346 align:middle line:84%
of energy with no
beginning and no end.

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, where were you?

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: I was In Venice,
actually, at the time.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.993 align:middle line:84%
I had moved away from
London and was in California

00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'd gone through a
really deeply cathartic time.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.452 align:middle line:90%
I was no fun to be around.

00:06:57.452 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I'd repressed
or suppressed or denied

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.022 align:middle line:84%
about myself was
coming to the surface.

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I was just going through
this amazing transformation.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So New Year's Eve of 2002,
2003, all of a sudden,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm here, having this
experience of the divine.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like the divine showed me.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In California?

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what were you
doing at the time, workwise?

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.756 align:middle line:90%
Were you just--

00:07:15.756 --> 00:07:16.505 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: I wasn't.

00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I was very blessed in the fact
that I could just kind of relax

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and just figure out what it
is I want to do with my life.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And so I
was very fortunate.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.184 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you asked
for this though, right?

00:07:25.184 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:90%
You confronted the divine?

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Mhm.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.369 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And after you
had that experience,

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:32.659 align:middle line:84%
what did you notice about
your lenses on life?

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, that I
was always connected.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing was that
that experience actually

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
confirmed to me everything that
I was experiencing as a child

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.125 align:middle line:84%
but subsequently
went on to deny.

00:07:41.125 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I was
always born in oneness

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:90%
and always living in oneness.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just because most
people aren't aware of that,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I denied it.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.375 align:middle line:90%
And then I came back to that.

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
The other upshot of it was
everything got luminous.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.083 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talk
about it in the book.

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.505 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have a moment
of just complete realization

00:07:54.505 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and awakening where I'm
walking around on the street

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:90%
and everything's glowing.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.291 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in Venice, California.

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Venice, California
doesn't naturally glow.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And like everything,
the graffiti, the streets,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everything, right?

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.600 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing was glowing.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And the light and the
luminosity that was always

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
present-- it's like the
true nature of reality

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:90%
was revealed to me.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you didn't--
nothing outside of you changed.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:90%
You changed.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And those things that used
to disconnect you before,

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.107 align:middle line:84%
where you saw the truth, how did
you approach those differently?

00:08:24.107 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: I didn't question them.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't question
my knowing anymore.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.565 align:middle line:84%
I didn't questioned
my truth anymore.

00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:90%
I stopped caring, I guess.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.115 align:middle line:84%
I stopped needing egoic
approval and acceptance

00:08:33.115 --> 00:08:34.860 align:middle line:90%
from outside of myself.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.575 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You stopped
caring about what?

00:08:36.575 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: What people had to say,
their thoughts, their opinions,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.797 align:middle line:84%
whether they liked
me, didn't like me.

00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:43.921 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I had that
experience of the divine,

00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:45.827 align:middle line:84%
there was just
complete acceptance,

00:08:45.827 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:90%
absolute acceptance.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.170 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter how
I'd lived my life.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.182 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you didn't care
what people thought about you.

00:08:52.182 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You got to be the full
opportunity of who you are.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But what about what you
thought of other people?

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Doesn't matter.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: None of it mattered.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.741 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: No, because all I could
see in them was their light.

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.406 align:middle line:84%
All I could see was
who they really are.

00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:84%
The saddest thing
for me is that people

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.404 align:middle line:84%
couldn't see that
for themselves.

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:08.352 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, yeah.

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that is
what you teach now,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
is about really seeing that
soul signature in somebody

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:84%
else, in themselves,
really, in ourselves.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, and
more than teaching it,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.311 align:middle line:84%
I'm very blessed in the fact
that we can experientially

00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:22.925 align:middle line:84%
deliver that to people so
that they stop questioning,

00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:84%
so they start owning
who they are and--

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.675 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do you do that?

00:09:25.675 --> 00:09:28.172 align:middle line:84%
How do you experiencially
deliver that people?

00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, this had been
happening to me my whole life.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember even at the youngest
ages, like five or seven,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd just be around
people, and all

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, all their
stuff would start coming up,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:84%
their sadness, their
anger, their fear,

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
their vibrational density,
everything that we've judged,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:90%
repressed, or suppressed.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:90%
And literally, they'd sit down.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:84%
They'd seemed encumbered
or burdened by life.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like life had gotten
the better of them.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Judgment had gotten
the better of them.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And they'd sit down with me and
they'd experience all of that.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:90%
They'd get up.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.476 align:middle line:90%
And they'd be sparkly.

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how I'd
describe it as a child.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought it was
absolutely weird, you know?

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.783 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to hear
people's life stories.

00:09:58.783 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to know
why they hated their wife

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.965 align:middle line:84%
or why they didn't
like their job.

00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd even have moments
of looking at them going,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.864 align:middle line:90%
I'm seven.

00:10:05.864 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I really don't want
to know all of this.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.029 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: But my whole
life's been like that.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that experience
then just solidified everything

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.230 align:middle line:90%
that I'd been created to be.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, how did
you then experience

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:84%
teaching this and really
imparting this information?

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
At what point did
you start doing that?

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Was it teenager?

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.853 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, for me it
was never about teaching,

00:10:25.853 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:84%
because nobody needs
to learn anything.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle line:84%
If anything, we
already know too much.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So what everybody
needs to really know

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.294 align:middle line:84%
is that enlightenment is an
entirely destructive process.

00:10:36.294 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And what's being
destroyed is everything

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that you believe is false
about you, everything

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that you've made more
real than the truth.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.455 align:middle line:84%
And so this energy and
this presence in the form

00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:84%
of the book or whatever it
is that I do is lovingly

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:84%
dismantling everything that
you've accepted as the truth,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.135 align:middle line:90%
but isn't.

00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And it all starts to fall
away until eventually you

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.435 align:middle line:84%
see yourself as infinite
potential and possibility.

00:10:58.435 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see that in
you and everyone that you meet.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
You begin to live
the oneness that

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.320 align:middle line:84%
is available in every
moment of life and living.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Enlightenment is
a dismantling process.

00:11:08.535 --> 00:11:09.925 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Mhm.

00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Most people
strive for enlightenment.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Mhm.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.921 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you say
it's dismantling.

00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Absolutely.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely peeling away
everything that is false,

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
everything, everything that's
the illusion, our story,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, our
beliefs, our identities.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.414 align:middle line:84%
Who are we beyond our
bodies and our minds?

00:11:27.414 --> 00:11:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:84%
In most ways, our experience
of life is being trapped.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Is being feeling like
you're constantly

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:90%
pushing against the machine.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And this takes the lid off of
that, allows you to kind of not

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
see through the separation
between yourself and things.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Even if things go wrong,
there's no separation there.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: No.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.765 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's oneness.

00:11:48.765 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the oneness that
you're talking about.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's exactly right.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And in truth, there's only
one foundational reality,

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and that is love.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.544 align:middle line:84%
And that's what everyone's
being guided back into again,

00:11:58.544 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:90%
but while we're alive.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.454 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk
about presence.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in this moment
right now with you,

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.919 align:middle line:84%
there is no
separation between us.

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Mhm.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm there.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm experiencing an energy
that just is circular.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's flowing
through both of us.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.816 align:middle line:90%
And you're part of me.

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of you.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredibly
circular feeling.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's also boundless.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:90%
There's no separation here.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So how do you experience that
with every single person?

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: I was born this way.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Acceptance is the key.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.997 align:middle line:84%
When you come into a profound
acceptance of yourself,

00:12:32.997 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:84%
at that point, you come
into a profound acceptance

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:90%
of other people.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So acceptance is the
key to self love.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.263 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you
have been unlocked the keys

00:12:40.263 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:84%
to the kingdom, because you can
love everything and everyone.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just
saw your body drop

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%
when you had that experience.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Did you just experience
something different just now?

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Mhm.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What was that?

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, when I'm talking
about these things, you see,

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:84%
it's also the energy's
being conveyed of them.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd invite people
to open their palms

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.039 align:middle line:84%
and really just
receive and really

00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:90%
experience what's being shared.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Because this interview
in and of itself

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to
serve as the reminder

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that you've asked for
a long time ago to once

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
again put you back
into the forefront

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of your authentic
vibrational self.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.222 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the energy comes
through the screen, wherever

00:13:14.222 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:90%
people are watching it.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.647 align:middle line:84%
I can experience that right now,
because my hands are tingling

00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:90%
right in the center of my palms.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.396 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Yeah, thousands of
people from all over the world

00:13:22.396 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:84%
feel it via webcasts
and TV shows.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And they all speak of
experience the energy.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.270 align:middle line:90%
It's really a phenomenon.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you
do the workshops--

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
see an example of this

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.370 align:middle line:84%
in a second, where
Panache is communicating

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:84%
this energy-- delivering
is a good word for it--

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.296 align:middle line:90%
this energy to people.

00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's actually take a
look at that-- Panache

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
in some of his
experiences and workshops.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.489 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:13:49.479 --> 00:14:14.928 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.928 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
-Hi, I'm Panache Desai, your
local friendly neighborhood

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.754 align:middle line:90%
enlightened being.

00:14:20.754 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
-Know that no matter what
you are going through,

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:84%
it is in divine
order and it is only

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.158 align:middle line:84%
your perception
that says otherwise.

00:14:33.158 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:84%
-From the minute I met him in
the very first session I had,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.216 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was it.

00:14:38.216 --> 00:14:41.040 align:middle line:84%
-We're either going to be
that change in the world

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.920 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to hand
off the responsibility

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.840 align:middle line:90%
to children and grandchildren.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Which one?

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:90%
-Be the change.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:90%
-Which one?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:90%
-Be the change.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:10%
For me, there's just this
feeling or knowing inside

00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:10%
that this is someone who
has a message for mankind.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And this time is
now and it's due.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
-When you have
someone like Panache

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.108 align:middle line:84%
that's holding the
presence, miracles happen.

00:15:11.108 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
-This gift is here at this
time to transform everything

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:90%
that it touches into love.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Our biggest obstacle, our
biggest challenge at this time

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:90%
is that we don't love ourselves.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the introduction of
this consciousness at this time

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.252 align:middle line:84%
is to help bring people
into that self love.

00:15:35.252 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And then that love permeates
everything around you.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And everyone around you receives
that experience of love.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:10%
-He's very, very, very calming,
affirming, inspirational man.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
-He exudes an energy that you
can feel from a half mile away.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:84%
-He almost comes in
through the back door,

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.834 align:middle line:84%
so you don't even really
know what happens until wow,

00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:90%
you know, your life changes.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:84%
-Direct experience of the
divine was the greatest moment

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.216 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:16:11.216 --> 00:16:13.885 align:middle line:84%
I experienced God
as an infinite ocean

00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:84%
of love, light, and
energy with no beginning

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and no end and a love
beyond description, a love

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
that even the greatest poets
could not describe in words.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:33.015 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.015 --> 00:16:37.470 align:middle line:84%
In certain levels
of awareness, you

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:84%
begin to access the same
wisdom and knowledge

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that every great master
and teacher has accessed

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.475 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:16:43.475 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when you can become
still enough in yourself

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and you become empowered
enough in you are,

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
wisdom spontaneously
arises from within.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.686 align:middle line:84%
You see, really, age has
nothing to do with it.

00:16:55.686 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The part that is the key
ingredient in all of this

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:90%
is conscious awareness.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And so my ability to consciously
access this wisdom, consciously

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.695 align:middle line:84%
connect with this
wisdom, this field

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
of infinite awareness that
surrounds me all the time

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:84%
is what allows me
to truly support

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:90%
individuals on this planet.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:10%
Even as a child, I realized that
I was always connected to God.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:10%
I incarnated into
a world, however,

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:10%
that believed it needed
to do something in order

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:10%
to have a relationship with God.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm always connected
to the divine.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:84%
There is never a moment in my
life when I'm not connected.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm like a goldfish
swimming in a goldfish bowl.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.324 align:middle line:84%
And the divine, or God, is that
water that I'm swimming in.

00:17:41.324 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is there are moments

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.406 align:middle line:84%
when I'm aware of the fact
that I'm swimming in that water

00:17:45.406 --> 00:17:47.715 align:middle line:84%
and there are moments where
it's my natural experience

00:17:47.715 --> 00:17:48.910 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not aware of it.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.317 align:middle line:90%
But it's always there.

00:17:52.317 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Just like a goldfish fish
doesn't search for the water--

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.283 align:middle line:84%
it knows it's in the water--
we as human beings don't

00:17:57.283 --> 00:17:58.485 align:middle line:90%
need to search for God.

00:17:58.485 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:90%
God is always around us.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Simply be aware of your breath.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Be aware of your body.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.285 align:middle line:90%
Breathe, slow down.

00:18:09.285 --> 00:18:10.243 align:middle line:90%
And watch what happens.

00:18:10.243 --> 00:18:13.117 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.117 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:84%
-I've been brought to a
place of love for myself

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.932 align:middle line:90%
that I never expected.

00:18:16.932 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
-I am not the same person
I was a year ago when

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I started attending
Panache's seminars.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thankful for that.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:90%
-I love you.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:90%
And I forgive you, too.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But you don't even need to be
forgiven, because you've never

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:90%
ever done anything wrong.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
At the point when someone's
journey or path intersects

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
with mine, they are completely
ready to own who they are

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and be who they are
here to be in the world.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.225 align:middle line:90%
That is why we find each other.

00:18:52.225 --> 00:18:54.061 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time
they've gotten to me,

00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
they've gone through
everything they

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
need to go through in order
to hear what it is that I have

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:84%
to say, in order to receive this
amazing gift that propels them

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.900 align:middle line:84%
into the next phase of who
they are, why they're here,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and what it is that
they've come to share.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:84%
-I had no idea
that this was what

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:90%
was going to be experienced.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And it is intoxicating.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
-Like I know I'm really lucky
to actually be able to come.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:10%
-It could be called the
last workshop, I think,

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:10%
if you get it.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:10%
And I feel like that after all
the workshops that I've done,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.990 align:middle line:10%
this may be one of the
last ones of mastery.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
-So someone's meeting with
me is not by accident.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't find me by accident.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.915 align:middle line:84%
You are drawn to
me, drawn to hear

00:19:40.915 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
what it is that I
have to say, drawn

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to receive this gift,
drawn at this time, pulled

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.065 align:middle line:84%
to be who you are here to
be, knowing and understanding

00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that you never needed to
be anything other than you.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
When you find me,
it's game over.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:84%
-I feel like every question
I've ever had has been answered.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:16.178 align:middle line:84%
I feel complete, totally whole,
and I feel my divine self.

00:20:16.178 --> 00:20:17.172 align:middle line:90%
-I'm not a guru.

00:20:17.172 --> 00:20:19.686 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a teacher.

00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I am simply an old friend that
you asked once a long time

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
ago to remind you of your
own inner magnificence.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:90%
-He's the real deal.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:90%
He's the real deal.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:84%
-Every time we come
to sessions, people

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:84%
quantum leap in the
experience of themselves.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Every time we come
together, this gift

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.695 align:middle line:84%
moves them further and
further along the path.

00:20:44.695 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
whether you're just beginning

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
or you've been on this journey
for 30, 40, or 50 years.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything this gift touches
transforms into love.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So the answer and
solution is here.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.018 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:09.265 align:middle line:90%
That is the question.

00:21:09.265 --> 00:21:12.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:90%
The answer and solution is here.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.602 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:21:19.602 --> 00:21:20.584 align:middle line:90%
That is the question.

00:21:20.584 --> 00:21:36.592 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So I had, in this-- I haven't
been to one of your workshops.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But I had an experience after
I spoke to you at one point.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:90%
We did an interview together.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And right after the
interview, I got

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:84%
in my car to go
pick up my daughter.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I got in
a car accident.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And I called you because
the accident was really

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:90%
traumatic for me.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
driving for 30 years.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And I had never had an accident.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:04.209 align:middle line:84%
And so I called you,
because I was very shocked.

00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think anyone experiences,
when they're in an accident--

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
something happens to
your aura, if you will.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:90%
It just jars you a lot.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was an accident
from-- I was hit from behind.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.520 align:middle line:90%
And I called you.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And you said, just be still
and just experience the energy.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:84%
What was it that you
did at that time that

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
enabled the feeling that I had
to get back into coherence?

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt my
aura start to mend.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.376 align:middle line:84%
I felt myself start to take
a breadth for the first time.

00:22:35.376 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, whether
I'm with an individual

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
or with thousands of people,
what happens is I become them

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
and they become me.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And so in your case,
you hadn't allowed

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
yourself to fully
experience the accident.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
the shock and the trauma of it

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.685 align:middle line:90%
had gotten stuck in your body.

00:22:51.685 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it did.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And it
caused a density.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I basically
just experienced

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.960 align:middle line:90%
the accident on your behalf.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.672 align:middle line:90%
And that's true for accidents.

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:01.505 align:middle line:90%
It's true for abuse.

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes when I'm
working with people who've

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.909 align:middle line:84%
had just horrific abuse,
they can't remember it.

00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:07.879 align:middle line:84%
It's like I relive the
abuse as if it's me.

00:23:07.879 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And so this is just an
ability that I have.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.245 align:middle line:84%
It's just to really profoundly
connect on the deepest level.

00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it
doesn't bother you

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:90%
the way that it would bother me?

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.965 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:15.965 --> 00:23:16.889 align:middle line:90%
How does it not?

00:23:16.889 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: It's just
a natural ability.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I think acceptance-- I think
that's the depths of my love.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You just allow it to--

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: You have to have--
love is all inclusive.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And the more expansive your
definition of the word love is,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:84%
the more you can be
available for other people.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But Panache,
when you have someone

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:84%
who's been through such
traumatic abuse-- and those

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:45.029 align:middle line:84%
are horrific feelings-- you
don't let them affect you?

00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Well, no, I cry.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And I feel everything
there is to feel.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't resist it at all.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And my heart breaks with
them, for them, for everything

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:90%
they've gone through.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel everything, every
emotion, the fear, the sadness,

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:84%
the anger, I feel
everything as if I'm them.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.026 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But in a
way that's love--

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:05.448 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's right.

00:24:05.448 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --that's
complete love around it.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.215 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Sometims we
just need some support.

00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It makes
sense, because--

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: --sometimes
people can help

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.849 align:middle line:84%
us go through things that
we can't by ourselves.

00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So like I always say to
people, I'm just an old friend,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:15.640 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I get to hold your hand and go
through these things with you

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes are challenging
for you to go through

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.490 align:middle line:90%
by yourself.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because in those
experiences, there is no love.

00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:90%
There is none--

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Well, no.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.829 align:middle line:84%
In those experiences,
there is love.

00:24:29.829 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the
traumatic experiences?

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Mhm.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.637 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, explain.

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:34.636 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Your car accident
was the best blessing

00:24:34.636 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that ever happened to you,
because you were going

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:84%
100 miles an hour
when I met you.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, you're right.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.983 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And so that
accident has caused you

00:24:41.983 --> 00:24:44.424 align:middle line:84%
now to re-prioritize
how you spend your time.

00:24:44.424 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's gotten you to slow
down and pick and choose

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.860 align:middle line:90%
what's important.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Had that accident
not have happened,

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the two-by-four would
not have been pleasant.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: So the
accident was a whisper.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is very true.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even actually
put that together.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I had-- prior,
about 13 years ago--

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.272 align:middle line:84%
had a really severe accident
where I lifted up out

00:25:10.272 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:84%
of my body and experienced this
consciousness that you are.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But I almost died
in that accident.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:90%
That was the pure expansive.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
this beautiful expansive

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, that
stopped me from a place

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:84%
where I was going where
I didn't need to go.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Right.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so this
was just a whisper

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:28.778 align:middle line:90%
to get me back to that place.

00:25:28.778 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's exactly right.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's always good to
catch it as the whisper

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
instead of to wait
for the two-by-four.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do we do that
before we get to the accident?

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:90%
How do we catch ourselves?

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.764 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the ego gets hold
of us and gets in the way.

00:25:43.764 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: What I've discovered
is that the one thing that's

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:84%
essential for us
to really evolve

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.780 align:middle line:84%
is to cultivate like an almost
brutal honesty with ourselves.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.797 align:middle line:84%
We have to be ruthless
with ourselves.

00:25:54.797 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In what way?

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.160 align:middle line:90%
How do you self question?

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Because you have to
know who you are, first of all.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.859 align:middle line:84%
You have to know what's
going on inside of you.

00:26:01.859 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to get to know
every aspect of yourself,

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
not just the parts that you
like, but all that you are.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
start to embrace them.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.847 align:middle line:84%
And then through embracing,
they become transparent.

00:26:11.847 --> 00:26:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Then the greater light and
luminosity of your soul

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:90%
begins to shine through.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So authenticity is
really nothing more

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
than the alignment of your
personality with your soul.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
discovering your soul signature

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
It's about embracing
those parts of ourselves

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.369 align:middle line:84%
that we've judged-- the same
thing I had to go through.

00:26:27.369 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, I bought
into the judgment.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I bought into separation,
because everyone else

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.077 align:middle line:90%
was doing it.

00:26:32.077 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, I
got to a point where

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I had to be still
and start feeling

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and accepting and
embracing who I was.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And as that happened,
I then began

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:84%
to open up to gifts,
talents, and abilities

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that were always
there inside of me.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the energy
that you deliver

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:84%
to people, and in the presence
of being in this energy,

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:90%
would you call this a gift?

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Or would you call this
something that you

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.009 align:middle line:90%
can teach anyone else to have?

00:26:59.009 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: I think that we all
have the potential for it.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we'll be
able to be conduits for it.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just sometimes we need some
individuals to go through it

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:84%
a little bit ahead of everybody
else to kind of pave the way.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's all this is.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.726 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you
walk into a room,

00:27:12.726 --> 00:27:15.045 align:middle line:84%
and people start-- still
to this day-- telling you

00:27:15.045 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:84%
their issues or their problems,
or you see their pain,

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.547 align:middle line:84%
or you see their challenges,
you don't go automatically

00:27:22.547 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
into talking to them about
their problems, do you.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.717 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: I just hug them.

00:27:25.717 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:90%

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's all they need.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:90%
That's all they want.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sometimes we all do.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: They just want a hug.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.120 align:middle line:90%
They don't want teachings.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.286 align:middle line:84%
They don't want-- they don't
need anything spiritual

00:27:33.286 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:90%
They just need a hug.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.240 align:middle line:84%
They just want to
know that they're OK.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:90%
So I just hug them.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It takes years and
years of stress off of someone

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.756 align:middle line:90%
when you hug someone.

00:27:43.756 --> 00:27:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask-- when they
talk to you about their pain,

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
about their situation,
is it ever anything

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.590 align:middle line:84%
that you can go back
and heal for them?

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.617 align:middle line:84%
Because I see people get up
out of wheelchairs around you.

00:27:58.617 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you
give them permission

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.995 align:middle line:90%
to be their soul signature.

00:28:02.995 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.604 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not really healing.

00:28:05.604 --> 00:28:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It looks like healing.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.394 align:middle line:90%
But it's not healing.

00:28:07.394 --> 00:28:11.149 align:middle line:84%
You see, what happens
is as vibration beings,

00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:90%
we operate on different levels.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So the subtlest
level is the soul.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
The layer above that
is the emotional layer.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, in most cases that's
where all our repressed

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.549 align:middle line:84%
or suppressed
emotional content is

00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:22.840 align:middle line:90%
that's keeping us disconnected.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
sometimes where we stay.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.595 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got our unconscious,
our conscious mind,

00:28:26.595 --> 00:28:27.520 align:middle line:90%
and our body.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.189 align:middle line:84%
So in hundreds of
thousands of cases,

00:28:29.189 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:84%
when I trace everything
back, there's

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.313 align:middle line:84%
something in that
emotional layer that

00:28:32.313 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been embraced
or felt or experienced.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And every time we're
open to just allowing

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that energy to move-- because
energy can shift states.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:84%
It can become solid like ice
or it can evaporate like steam.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And in that same way, energy
can constantly shift and change.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when we can start to
embrace and accept who we are,

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.442 align:middle line:84%
we start to return to a
state of flow and harmony.

00:28:51.442 --> 00:28:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And then it looks like
something miraculous happened,

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.233 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't.

00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just that person
is now fully coming back

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:90%
to being themselves.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.949 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you don't
actually change

00:28:58.949 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:90%
the past and who they were.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
You send a different vibration
to that solid memory that

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.830 align:middle line:84%
gets stuck in our emotion
that we believe is true.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And you start to send
a different vibration

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
to that memory and
break it up essentially.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.775 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, love is the
most dominant energy there is.

00:29:12.775 --> 00:29:13.689 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:29:13.689 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And so when
you're in the presence

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:84%
of that energy of
love, nothing can

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:90%
remain but the energy of love.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.287 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:29:21.287 --> 00:29:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a different
energy at all.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.247 align:middle line:84%
It's just we all can do it, is
basically what you're saying.

00:29:26.247 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:84%
All right, I want you to
take a look at this video

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
here where Panache is
doing this exact thing.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.406 align:middle line:90%

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:10%
-One of the biggest
culprits today

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.770 align:middle line:10%
that keeps us locked in
distraction is actually stress.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:10%
The majority of human beings
on this planet cannot navigate

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:10%
the energy of stress.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.320 align:middle line:10%
And again, what do we do?

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:90%
We check out mentally.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:90%
We check out mentally.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.800 align:middle line:90%
We tell ourselves stories.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:90%
We hold on to things.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:90%
We abide in the past.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Or we project ourselves
off into a future

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:84%
where this scenario
no longer exists.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Those people, when
they're confronted

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.942 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace, where
someone says or does something,

00:30:11.942 --> 00:30:13.400 align:middle line:84%
they'll start
projecting themselves

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.477 align:middle line:84%
into a future reality
where they're retired

00:30:15.477 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and they'll no longer
ever have to see

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
this person and their
Hawaiian shirts ever again.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.879 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why
Hawaiian shirts.

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they are Hawaiian shirts.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:23.711 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:23.711 --> 00:30:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I just had a moment of
Magnum PI appreciation.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, maybe it's
a Hawaiian shirt.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Or you never have to
see those ties again

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.740 align:middle line:84%
with the checks and the
lines, or whatever it is.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:90%
So someone's talking to you.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Instead of feeling the
pain that is arising inside

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of you, the anger, the
sadness, or the fear,

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:84%
you will go off into
a future reality

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
where you are retired,
sitting on a hammock.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And all you can
hear and all you can

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:84%
do with this situation is be
engaged in the wa, wa, wa, wa,

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:84%
wa, wa, wa that is
going on around you.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the very
second you go there,

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
you have cut yourself
off from your life force.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why distractions
are self-destructive

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.640 align:middle line:84%
is that when we
engage in them, we

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:84%
are not furthering
our expression.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:90%
We are not furthering our life.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But in those moments
where we are triggered,

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:28.598 align:middle line:84%
we are actually,
actually, actually,

00:31:28.598 --> 00:31:32.242 align:middle line:90%
actually avoiding the impulse.

00:31:32.242 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
We're avoiding what is wanting
to happen that would actually

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:90%
further our lives.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to blow your minds.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Your pain and your
willingness to feel your pain

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:84%
determines the
quality of your life.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.120 align:middle line:90%
It sounds absolutely insane.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean my
pain and my willingness

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
to feel my pain determines
the quality in experience

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:90%
of my life?

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, those people that are
courageous or crazy enough

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.175 align:middle line:84%
to feel their pain are actually
the most empowered and the most

00:32:00.175 --> 00:32:00.675 align:middle line:90%
fulfilled.

00:32:00.675 --> 00:32:03.740 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Those people that
don't need to go

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:15.080 align:middle line:84%
to distraction to mitigate,
to limit, to minimize,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.910 align:middle line:84%
those people that can stay
in the experience of pain

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:84%
actually flourish
and evolve faster.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:84%
You see, our pain
in and of itself

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.597 align:middle line:90%
is an evolutionary catalyst.

00:32:27.597 --> 00:32:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything is.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:33.482 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.482 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:10%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so you at some
point took the chanting

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that you were doing and
dive into the frequencies

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.221 align:middle line:90%
of that particular chanting.

00:32:44.221 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that experience.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.990 align:middle line:90%
What led you to do that?

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well,
Sanskrit and Hebrew

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:90%
are vibrational languages.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So when you chant them,
they have the ability

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:90%
to completely purify you.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.157 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does it
awaken that vibration,

00:32:56.157 --> 00:32:57.490 align:middle line:90%
or is it just there by doing it?

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:10%
>>DESAI: Well, sound and
syllables-- these sounds

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:10%
and these syllables are sacred.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.730 align:middle line:10%
And so they resonate
at such a high level

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.230 align:middle line:10%
that they literally
have the ability

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.390 align:middle line:10%
to begin to dismantle all
of that emotional and heavy

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:10%
content, that density
that we've created.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And so I began to look into 'em.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, what is this
thing that's going on?

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And so just as much
as sound and syllables

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.546 align:middle line:84%
can do that, again, people can
be a catalyst in the same way.

00:33:19.546 --> 00:33:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So I discovered
this thing called

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Solfeggio frequencies, which
is all these hidden frequencies

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that most people are not even
aware of that are embedded

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.870 align:middle line:84%
in Sanskrit, in Hebrew,
and Gregorian chants,

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:33.840 align:middle line:84%
in certain ancient chants that
subsequently have disappeared.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they've disappeared

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.261 align:middle line:84%
is because they were
a little too effective

00:33:37.261 --> 00:33:39.026 align:middle line:90%
in bringing people into oneness.

00:33:39.026 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And explain that further.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.780 align:middle line:84%
How was there a
power that needed

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.330 align:middle line:90%
to squash that effectiveness?

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, it
just depends on what

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:48.640 align:middle line:90%
your doorway to the divine is.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So if your doorway to the
divine is through a human being,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.604 align:middle line:90%
then you need to keep that up.

00:33:53.604 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But if your doorway to
the divine is directly,

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:90%
you don't need anybody.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.424 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:33:57.424 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: We're
moving into a point

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.120 align:middle line:84%
now where we'll all have our
own personal relationship

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:90%
with the divine.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And we won't need
anyone else anymore

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:84%
to be the intermediary
between us and our source.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have experienced
gurus and been around them

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.225 align:middle line:90%
all your life.

00:34:12.225 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:84%
What would you say about that,
that you don't necessarily

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.960 align:middle line:84%
need the guru to
get to the divine?

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.751 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: I'd say that
the gurus-- you know,

00:34:17.751 --> 00:34:19.287 align:middle line:90%
if you have a guru, fantastic.

00:34:19.287 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But the guru is
basically nothing more

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.230 align:middle line:84%
than an embodiment of
yourself in orange.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.711 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:34:25.711 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And that's the core
teaching of it, you know?

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.889 align:middle line:90%
God, guru, and self are one.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I think people forget
that, you know?

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:33.005 align:middle line:84%
They have a tendency to
put people on a pedestal.

00:34:33.005 --> 00:34:34.880 align:middle line:84%
But then they also end
up being disappointed,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.638 align:middle line:84%
because they put
someone on a pedestal.

00:34:36.638 --> 00:34:37.429 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True, true.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: So if you
don't appoint anybody,

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have
to be disappointed.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.676 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what
about these gurus

00:34:41.676 --> 00:34:43.270 align:middle line:84%
that sit and don't
eat for a year

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and have that, by being
in their presence,

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:84%
you get that inner-- I
mean, explain, please.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:52.139 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, human beings can
serve as catalysts, you see.

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:53.969 align:middle line:84%
So in India, we have
this ancient practice

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:55.350 align:middle line:90%
called Darshan.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And Darshan is to be in the
presence of an enlightened

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.870 align:middle line:90%
or actualized being.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And you can sit
with them and be with them.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.516 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they'll start

00:35:02.516 --> 00:35:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to remind you vibrationally
of who you are.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very
ancient thing that's

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.620 align:middle line:84%
existed in my
culture for thousands

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.790 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a very
unique soul to be

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.390 align:middle line:84%
able to do that on a
large scale and to impact

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:90%
millions of people.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And it takes an even
more advanced soul

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.622 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do it
in a worldly context.

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah, it does.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Because you can sit there and be
in that world, in that bubble,

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But when you come out
and you're traveling

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and you have young ones,
and you're raising a family,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and you have life that
you confront every minute,

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.282 align:middle line:90%
you're in a practical world.

00:35:42.282 --> 00:35:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: And I love it.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.044 align:middle line:90%
And I love being human.

00:35:45.044 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the best thing.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.918 align:middle line:84%
I think people are missing
the point, you know?

00:35:47.918 --> 00:35:49.850 align:middle line:84%
We're in such a rush to
become something other

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:50.570 align:middle line:90%
than who we are.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:51.770 align:middle line:84%
We're missing the
point, you know?

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I love being human.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that I'm
married and I have two

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.710 align:middle line:84%
18-month-year-olds running
around, pointing at everything,

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:90%
just in absolute curiosity.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.470 align:middle line:84%
My mom and dad are at
my house every day.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a hub of
activity in my home.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.096 align:middle line:90%
And that's the point.

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:08.079 align:middle line:90%
The point is to be human fully.

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's joy.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But what about when
wrongness comes in,

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.760 align:middle line:84%
where somebody would do
something wrong to you

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:84%
or take advantage
of you or exploit?

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.500 align:middle line:90%
And that affects you.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, honestly, I
just feel sad for that person,

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:24.530 align:middle line:84%
because then they're
unconsciously just doing it

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.380 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.445 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
saddest thing of all.

00:36:29.445 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize
what they're dong.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.782 align:middle line:84%
If they did, they wouldn't do
half the things that they do.

00:36:33.782 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:84%

It's painful.

>>DESAI: Well, yeah,
but again, it's

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.990 align:middle line:84%
like it's so painful
for them, you know.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Really, when you
look at it, and you

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:44.615 align:middle line:84%
look at the way it plays
out, eventually, everybody

everything here.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.936 align:middle line:84%
So they're just keeping
themselves separate

00:36:48.936 --> 00:36:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and keeping themselves
different from who they are,

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.525 align:middle line:90%
unnecessarily.

00:36:52.525 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well,
since we're talking

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.399 align:middle line:84%
about vibrational
frequencies, let's

00:36:55.399 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
talk about the
vibration of stress

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and what that looks like
on a frequency level.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:90%
What does stress look like?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.171 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Stress is
an energy inhibitor.

00:37:05.171 --> 00:37:05.670 align:middle line:90%

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it slow?

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Naturally, it's dense.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:90%
It's slow.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.040 align:middle line:90%
And it weighs you down.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And it impedes your
ability to function.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.040 align:middle line:84%
It impedes your
neurological function.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.470 align:middle line:84%
It impedes you
biological function.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It impedes your
spiritual ability

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.040 align:middle line:90%
to really flower and flow.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.914 align:middle line:84%
I mean, stress gets in
the way of everything.

00:37:21.914 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:90%
But stress isn't the enemy.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:84%
It's our resistance to
stress that's the problem.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:90%
It's our distress.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Stress is a natural part of
life and living, you see.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It sneaks
up on you, though.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:90%
It compounds.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Only when
we resist change.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.740 align:middle line:84%
You see, human beings
are change resistant.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.909 align:middle line:84%
Stress is a natural
evolutionary impulse.

00:37:39.909 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:84%
When we're about to
evolve into more,

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to experience
some form of stress.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.905 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: The problem is we're so
change resistant and so afraid

00:37:46.905 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:84%
of what we don't know
that we resist it.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:90%
And then it becomes distress.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And then it accumulates
in our bodies.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Then it becomes solid.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.266 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And then
it starts to get

00:37:55.266 --> 00:37:57.500 align:middle line:84%
in the way of the flow of
energy through our bodies

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and through our lives.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.730 align:middle line:90%
And so stress is a good thing.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:84%
When you're experiencing
stress, it's fantastic.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It means you're about to evolve

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Fear is fantastic.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Any time you start
feeling fear, it's

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.680 align:middle line:84%
great, because you
know that there's

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.888 align:middle line:84%
something beyond your comfort

go into stress.

said made so much sense to me.

Because stress, by resisting
it, it makes it thicker.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And so if a sleepless night
happens or fatigue happens,

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.570 align:middle line:84%
you could go into that with a
little bit more flow and ease.

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:90%

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:10%
-Picture for a moment that
you are a ship out at sea

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:46.030 align:middle line:10%
and that you are all of a
sudden greeted by a huge wave.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, when life happens, we
have one of two options.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We can either try and outrun
that wave, which in this case

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely impossible.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:58.760 align:middle line:84%
We can brace
ourselves for the hit.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Or we can actually begin
to steer into the wave,

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.290 align:middle line:84%
to give our attention
to the wave,

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to give our a complete focus
to it and then surrender to it.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.550 align:middle line:84%
What is required
is a willingness,

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:16.500 align:middle line:84%

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:11.920 align:middle line:90%
whether you want it to or not.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Distraction provides
a temporary delay

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:84%
of the inevitable,
the inevitable being

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.840 align:middle line:84%
that at some point, that fear
is going to crash into you.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.050 align:middle line:84%
That fear is going to
want to wash through you.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of
how skilled you've

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:84%
become at dancing
with distraction,

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and how skilled you've become
at avoiding and denying

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.570 align:middle line:84%
what you are present
to, at some point,

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:84%
you will end up in a place
where you can no longer run.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
is, take some breath,

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:49.150 align:middle line:84%
as you are this little
boat out at sea.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And this giant wave of
fear is approaching you.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Stop and slow down.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Breathe and relax.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to lovingly
switch off the engine.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Switch it off.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You can no longer
outrun this thing.

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.690 align:middle line:90%
You can't outrun this thing.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.110 align:middle line:90%
You can't avoid it.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:16.080 align:middle line:90%
You cannot escape it.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.760 align:middle line:90%
It is going to hit you.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.940 align:middle line:90%
It is going to impact you.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.820 align:middle line:84%
This energy, this experience,
this emotion, and your life

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.030 align:middle line:84%
are destined to
intersect right now.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:35.822 align:middle line:90%

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you and
I are having right here.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And even though the
people watching right now

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:52.100 align:middle line:84%
can feel that as
they get engaged,

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I would love you to bring
in some of your tradition,

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.840 align:middle line:84%
if you could, of what
you were raised with,

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.350 align:middle line:84%
some of the-- as we were
talking about the Solfeggio

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.280 align:middle line:84%

I say that right?

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah, you did.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.605 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, good.

00:44:03.605 --> 00:44:04.395 align:middle line:90%

Solfeggio frequencies.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.486 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's right.

00:44:07.486 --> 00:44:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Put your hear and soul into it.

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these frequencies
actually can bond together

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and can bring together broken
parts, right, cells-- or how

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:16.684 align:middle line:90%
does that work?

00:44:16.684 --> 00:44:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, the
Solfeggio frequencies

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:90%
are pretty fantastic.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, in ancient
civilizations and cultures,

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.812 align:middle line:84%
they typically would have
seven initiation chambers.

00:44:23.812 --> 00:44:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And in every one
of these chambers,

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.064 align:middle line:84%
they would play a
different frequency.

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And every one of
these frequencies

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.990 align:middle line:84%
resonates with every
one of the seven chakras

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.572 align:middle line:90%
in the human body system.

00:44:32.572 --> 00:44:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's so cool,
because now even Dr. Oz

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.560 align:middle line:84%
is talking about chakras and
how we balance our chakras

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.726 align:middle line:90%
and why that's so important.

00:44:37.726 --> 00:44:39.305 align:middle line:84%
Because his wife's
an energy healer.

00:44:39.305 --> 00:44:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is she?

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And so now it's
becoming common knowledge

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have these
things called chakras,

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:45.950 align:middle line:84%
we are vibrational
beings, that we

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:48.490 align:middle line:84%
have these vibrational
centers within us,

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and that actually
what's required

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.980 align:middle line:84%
is our willingness to come
into alignment and harmony

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.910 align:middle line:84%
with these vibration
centers in who we are.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, just the acceptance
of who you are is enough,

00:44:59.050 --> 00:44:59.550 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:44:59.550 --> 00:44:59.886 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:44:59.886 --> 00:45:00.900 align:middle line:90%
That's the precursor.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.256 align:middle line:84%
That's the fastest path
to oneness, is acceptance.

00:45:03.256 --> 00:45:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You could
say that 1,200 times,

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and people wouldn't
get it though.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's right.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the experience
of it that makes a difference.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.361 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: So one of the ways I've
discovered to really support

00:45:11.361 --> 00:45:13.370 align:middle line:84%
people in having
that experience is

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:15.886 align:middle line:84%
to rest in the awareness
of their breath.

00:45:15.886 --> 00:45:17.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're
always breathing.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.009 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:45:18.009 --> 00:45:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And our breath
is only ever happening

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.157 align:middle line:90%
in each present moment.

00:45:22.157 --> 00:45:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And so when we can
actually just start

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:25.735 align:middle line:84%
to observe our inhalation
and exhalation,

00:45:25.735 --> 00:45:29.330 align:middle line:84%
it's almost we start to
experience a transcendent state

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:31.700 align:middle line:84%
where authenticity
just kind of happens.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Our soul begins
to shine through.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Our light and our
luminosity and our presence

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:37.090 align:middle line:90%
begins to shine through.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I like that,
Lisa, is because nobody knows.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.360 align:middle line:90%
You're not doing it.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not externalized.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not obvious.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But just resting in the
awareness of your breath

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.480 align:middle line:84%
transforms your life
into a living meditation.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you transform a
situation that's upsetting

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:55.027 align:middle line:90%
during that--

00:45:55.027 --> 00:45:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Absolutely.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.401 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you're
talking to someone,

00:45:57.401 --> 00:45:59.160 align:middle line:84%
if you're in an
emotional moment,

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.490 align:middle line:84%
can you bring the breath
in to calm that person down

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.010 align:middle line:90%
without them even knowing it?

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, yeah, because you
calming down calms them down.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.300 align:middle line:90%
You become a still pond.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
in your vicinity

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.410 align:middle line:90%
has to become calm eventually.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was in a
situation the other day

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.576 align:middle line:84%
where someone was sitting in
front of me and talking to me

00:46:17.576 --> 00:46:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and completely bold
faced lying to me.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it.

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't going
to hear the confrontation

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.580 align:middle line:90%
I was going to bring up.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.200 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't going to work.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So I went into a place of breath
and just started breathing.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:36.017 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't actually hear what
they said beyond that because--

00:46:36.017 --> 00:46:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: It doesn't really
matter what they were saying.

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:40.266 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because it could
have really upset me.

00:46:40.266 --> 00:46:41.670 align:middle line:90%
And it was an attack on me.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And it could have really--
I could have gone head on,

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.579 align:middle line:84%
but I-- I just didn't see
it in the moment, of needing

00:46:47.579 --> 00:46:48.120 align:middle line:90%
it to happen.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:90%
But I'm reminded of that moment.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Because you talk about breath.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what I did.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, I mean, you
get to the top of the mountain

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.810 align:middle line:84%
in the Himalayas, and that's
what you're going to get.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.393 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most
profound thing there

00:46:57.393 --> 00:47:00.900 align:middle line:84%
is, because breath and
spirit, in so many traditions,

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:84%
they have the same name
for breath and spirit.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is that?

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the divine placed
our connection right

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:07.797 align:middle line:90%
under our noses.

00:47:07.797 --> 00:47:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we
don't pay attention.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.689 align:middle line:84%
I dedicated a whole
chapter to it in my book.

00:47:12.689 --> 00:47:15.230 align:middle line:84%
The gods on Mount Olympus were
having a conversation one day.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And being gods, they were
trying to outdo each other.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.165 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
where are we going

00:47:19.165 --> 00:47:22.000 align:middle line:84%
to hide this sacred
part of human beings,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.409 align:middle line:90%
this divine aspect of them?

00:47:23.409 --> 00:47:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're all trying
to outdo each other.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, one
of them said, I know.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.791 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it under their noses.

00:47:27.791 --> 00:47:29.669 align:middle line:90%
They'll never look there.

00:47:29.669 --> 00:47:30.710 align:middle line:90%
They'll never look there.

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:90%
They'll go to mountains.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.030 align:middle line:90%
They'll got to monasteries.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:34.071 align:middle line:90%
They'll go and meditate.

00:47:34.071 --> 00:47:35.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll go do all
kinds of retreats.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:37.319 align:middle line:84%
But they won't look
under their own noses.

00:47:37.319 --> 00:47:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:39.320 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.280 align:middle line:84%
We have it no matter where we
are, every moment of the day.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Right.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And when
you do, and when

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:47.510 align:middle line:84%
you had experienced chanting
and so forth as a child,

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:48.690 align:middle line:90%
were you taught that?

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:51.005 align:middle line:84%
Was breath a big
part of chanting?

00:47:51.005 --> 00:47:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Yeah,
because naturally,

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.050 align:middle line:84%
you see, chanting--
most people chant

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.060 align:middle line:84%
as if they're chanting to
something outside of them.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.031 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And I was
never taught that.

00:47:58.031 --> 00:48:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I was taught to chant as if
I was chanting to myself.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So instead of chanting to
some external form of God,

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:06.530 align:middle line:84%
you're honoring
the divine within.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And in my household, we grew
up with one specific mantra,

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.260 align:middle line:84%
which is Om Namah
Shivaya, which is

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I honor my own inner divinity.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I bow to the sacred
divine that I am.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.574 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
core of everything

00:48:18.574 --> 00:48:20.990 align:middle line:84%
that I felt and experienced,
is that we had divine beings.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.607 align:middle line:84%
And the more we can
use our breath--

00:48:23.607 --> 00:48:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and even when we use that
mantra along with our breath--

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.930 align:middle line:84%
as you inhale, om namah
shivaya, and as you exhale,

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.200 align:middle line:84%
om namah shivaya--
you can start to get

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.755 align:middle line:84%
in touch with that
part of you that

00:48:33.755 --> 00:48:35.879 align:middle line:84%
is transcendent
and ever present.

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And if you like mantras, great.

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't,
just use the breath.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:40.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, personally,
I just use the breath.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:40.770 align:middle line:90%
You know, that--

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But the
breath is infused

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.510 align:middle line:84%
with your mantra in
your mind, right?

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: No, you don't
need to do that even.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.500 align:middle line:84%
If you like that,
you can do that.

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.666 align:middle line:90%
But it's really very simple.

00:48:47.666 --> 00:48:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Just be aware of the breath.

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's simple, but not
for the busy Western mind

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.967 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:48:52.967 --> 00:48:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you take us
through an experience

00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:01.220 align:middle line:84%
where I can detach
from that needing

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.530 align:middle line:90%
to have something tangible?

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:03.113 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Sure.

00:49:03.113 --> 00:49:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Just close your eyes.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.275 align:middle line:84%
Just open your palms,
busy Western mind.

00:49:07.275 --> 00:49:07.775 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:07.775 --> 00:49:10.867 align:middle line:90%


00:49:10.867 --> 00:49:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And just observe the
inhalation and exhalation.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I feel like I'm going
to lift right off this chair.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Just witness the
inhalation and exhalation.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.233 align:middle line:84%
There's two things
that are happening.

00:49:26.233 --> 00:49:30.550 align:middle line:84%
First of all, your central
nervous system is calming down.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Your body's calming down.

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:33.145 align:middle line:90%
You're opening up to receive.

00:49:33.145 --> 00:49:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And that transcendent
part of you

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.380 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to make
itself known to you.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.952 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:49:40.952 --> 00:49:43.330 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that's
happening is this energy,

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:46.344 align:middle line:84%
this presence is beginning
to accelerate you

00:49:46.344 --> 00:49:48.760 align:middle line:84%
through everything within you
that you've judged repressed

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.509 align:middle line:90%
or suppressed.

00:49:49.509 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.300 align:middle line:90%
You say that I'm calming down.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.160 align:middle line:90%
But I feel the opposite.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:55.355 align:middle line:84%
Not the opposite,
but accelerated.

00:49:55.355 --> 00:49:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: So
sometimes people feel

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:58.400 align:middle line:84%
like they're plugged
into an electric socket.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.586 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Sometimes people feel
intense heat, intense cold.

00:50:01.586 --> 00:50:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, all of that.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:04.782 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: People feel emotion.

00:50:04.782 --> 00:50:06.980 align:middle line:84%
They have flashbacks
or memories or traumas

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.360 align:middle line:84%
that they've forgotten or
weren't willing to embrace.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, this
energy's function

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.840 align:middle line:84%
is to bring people back into
harmony with themselves.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.940 align:middle line:84%
We are the only
species that does not

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.200 align:middle line:90%
live in harmony with itself.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So we are blessed
and fortunate enough

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.705 align:middle line:84%
to be provided with
an opportunity now

00:50:28.705 --> 00:50:32.065 align:middle line:84%
in which we can once again come
into harmony with ourselves.

00:50:32.065 --> 00:50:34.720 align:middle line:90%


00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And even if you can just
sit for three minutes

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:43.547 align:middle line:84%
and just relax and just rest in
the awareness of your breath.

00:50:43.547 --> 00:50:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
with your eyes open.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:45.765 align:middle line:90%
You can do it at work.

00:50:45.765 --> 00:50:47.130 align:middle line:84%
You can do it when
you're with your kids.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, you can.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: You can do
wherever you are.

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:50.565 align:middle line:84%
Life becomes a
living meditation.

00:50:50.565 --> 00:50:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is a state
know as Samadhi.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Samadhi is union, union, a
complete union between the body

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:01.480 align:middle line:90%
the mind and the soul.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.670 align:middle line:90%
That is what this is.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And the simplicity of it is key,
because the more simple it is,

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.340 align:middle line:90%
the more powerful it is.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The colors have
changed around you.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I can see a huge amount
of light around you.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's completely--
that was not even a minute.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.297 align:middle line:84%
It's a continuation
of the energy

00:51:22.297 --> 00:51:23.380 align:middle line:90%
that you and I are in now.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.296 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's right.

00:51:24.296 --> 00:51:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, it
just keeps going.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.710 align:middle line:90%
It keeps continuing.

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the chant and the
breath is one in the same.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yes.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
way that you speak

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.520 align:middle line:84%
is one in the same with chant
and breath and speaking.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.970 align:middle line:90%
It's all one in the same.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:43.204 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
you blink, actually.

00:51:43.204 --> 00:51:46.090 align:middle line:90%
You have this engaging draw.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:47.860 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.910 align:middle line:84%
You're so connected in
such a beautiful way.

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Thank you.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In this space right
now, there is no pain.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.960 align:middle line:90%
There is no trauma.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.050 align:middle line:90%
There is no stress.

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:00.554 align:middle line:90%
There is only love.

00:52:00.554 --> 00:52:03.226 align:middle line:90%
There is only divine.

00:52:03.226 --> 00:52:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're in this
moment all the time,

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.790 align:middle line:84%
whether or not you're busy,
whether or not you're teaching.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:10.750 align:middle line:84%
You're in front of 3,000
people, you're just with me.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.560 align:middle line:90%
You don't leave this space.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:17.290 align:middle line:84%
That is the biggest lesson
that I have drawn from you,

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:18.870 align:middle line:90%
is this space.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:20.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't leave it.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.560 align:middle line:90%
You're always in it.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:22.060 align:middle line:90%
But you're--

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And that's not to
say that I don't get upset.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.540 align:middle line:90%
I get upset.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:26.909 align:middle line:84%
But I don't resist the
fact that I'm upset.

00:52:26.909 --> 00:52:28.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not to say that
I don't feel insecure.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.616 align:middle line:90%
I still feel insecure.

00:52:29.616 --> 00:52:31.855 align:middle line:84%
But I don't resit the fact
that I'm feeling that.

00:52:31.855 --> 00:52:35.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, if something triggers
me in life, I run towards it.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But less will trigger
you, because you're not

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:42.422 align:middle line:84%
going to engage in that
lower vibrational stuff.

00:52:42.422 --> 00:52:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And again, it's
not lower vibrational.

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Our humanity is the
doorway to our divinity.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.319 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
don't understand.

00:52:50.319 --> 00:52:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's trying
to bypass their ego

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.068 align:middle line:90%
and bypass their personality.

00:52:53.068 --> 00:52:54.320 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to lovingly embrace
every single aspect of who

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:01.280 align:middle line:84%
you are: your fear, your
sadness, your guilt,

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.110 align:middle line:90%
your shame.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I provided
a systematic 33-day guide

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.969 align:middle line:84%
into to how we accept
ourselves in this book.

00:53:08.969 --> 00:53:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That helps.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: That's why.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:10.741 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That helps.

00:53:10.741 --> 00:53:12.535 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Because people
need that support.

00:53:12.535 --> 00:53:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And every
single day, you

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:17.710 align:middle line:84%
take people through a specific
meditation in the book?

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:20.962 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: Well, in the morning,
we cultivate your awareness.

00:53:20.962 --> 00:53:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the afternoon, we
provide you a practice

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.640 align:middle line:84%
so you can begin to
prove to yourself

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.270 align:middle line:90%
these principles in real life.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Because until you do
that, they're not yours.

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you give
me an example of one

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:30.410 align:middle line:90%
of the practices?

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:30.993 align:middle line:90%
>>DESAI: Yeah.

00:53:30.993 --> 00:53:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So fear-- you know,
we all have fear.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.480 align:middle line:84%
We just let fear
get the best of us.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So one of the practices is we
actually tend to the garden.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:39.262 align:middle line:90%
We tend to our garden.

00:53:39.262 --> 00:53:40.720 align:middle line:10%
And we start pulling
out the weeds.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.430 align:middle line:10%
And the weeds are the fear.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:45.192 align:middle line:10%
And we start
experiencing the energy.

00:53:45.192 --> 00:53:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting
involved in the story,

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.500 align:middle line:84%
it's like we start experiencing
the energy of fear.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.330 align:middle line:10%
And we literally
start to realize

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:53.330 align:middle line:10%
that fear doesn't really
have any power over us,

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:56.300 align:middle line:10%
that it's just an experience
like anything else.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.870 align:middle line:10%
And literally,
then at that point,

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.328 align:middle line:10%
by the time you
get to the evening,

00:53:59.328 --> 00:54:02.170 align:middle line:10%
you are read a
beautiful lullaby, as if

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:05.339 align:middle line:10%
the divine itself
was speaking to you.

00:54:05.339 --> 00:54:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the magic
happens while you sleep.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really.

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I can imagine it
happening during the day.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.770 align:middle line:84%
When you get out of
that place of fear,

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:14.507 align:middle line:90%
you can really transform.

00:54:14.507 --> 00:54:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Miracles can happen.

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DESAI: And that's
why I start with fear.

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why I start
with it, because it's

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.240 align:middle line:90%
where you have to begin.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Also, I want you take a look
at the video where Panache

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:29.580 align:middle line:84%
is talking about the vibrational
frequencies and the Earth's

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.830 align:middle line:84%
resonance as well. so
take a look at that.

00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:32.746 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:54:32.746 --> 00:54:34.250 align:middle line:90%
-Hi, I'm Panache Desai.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to "Align,
Attune, Ascend,"

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:41.690 align:middle line:84%
a vibration solution
created to support you

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:46.180 align:middle line:84%
in accessing harmony, living a
life of vibrational increase,

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:49.990 align:middle line:84%
so that you can embody all
that you are here to be.

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Ancient civilizations
hid vibrational tools

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:55.570 align:middle line:90%
and technologies in plain sight.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:59.565 align:middle line:84%
They recognized and revered
the power of sound vibration

00:54:59.565 --> 00:55:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and frequency to help us
evolve, to help us ascend,

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to help us move up
the vibrational scale.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:12.450 align:middle line:84%
These frequencies are known
as Solfeggio frequencies.

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And they vibrate
on a hertz scale

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:18.620 align:middle line:90%
that is mostly forgotten today.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:22.820 align:middle line:84%
However, this hertz scale has
the potential to repair DNA,

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.070 align:middle line:84%
to bring you into
universal harmony,

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:29.130 align:middle line:84%
to help facilitate your internal
alchemy so that you can move

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:31.330 align:middle line:84%
beyond the density that's
been holding you back,

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and you can send it into your
greatest potential and light.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these
frequencies is specifically

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.585 align:middle line:84%
attuned to every vibrational
center that is within you.

00:55:40.585 --> 00:55:43.950 align:middle line:84%
These Solfeggio frequencies,
married together

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.240 align:middle line:84%
with the gift of
vibrational transformation,

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.620 align:middle line:84%
are a potent
combination, designed

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.680 align:middle line:84%
to not only support
you acoustically,

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:56.240 align:middle line:84%
but to support you vibrationally
in coming into all that you are

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and all that you've
been born to be.

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait for you to
dive into these tools.

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And it has been my
honor to bring them back

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:06.135 align:middle line:84%
into the forefront of
our modern world today.

00:56:06.135 --> 00:56:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Our planet's
heartbeat is shifting.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.630 align:middle line:90%
Things are speeding up.

00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Our universe is evolving.

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And it is important
now more than ever

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that we match the
planet's heartbeat,

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that we move into alignment
with everything that is going on

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:23.690 align:middle line:84%
around us so that we can
ascend into our greatest

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:27.030 align:middle line:84%
truth, our greatest light,
and our greatest potential.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.320 align:middle line:84%
If you are ready
to make a quantum

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.840 align:middle line:84%
leap in your experience
of being human,

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.930 align:middle line:84%
then "Align, Attune,
and Ascend" is for you.

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm Panache Desai.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And it is my absolute honor to
be your guide as together we

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:44.610 align:middle line:84%
journey back into the
ancient to bring forth light

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:47.710 align:middle line:84%
into the modern so that
we can move into a future

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that we are writing
with our own hands.

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.230 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you for loving me.

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll see you as
we ascend together

00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:00.197 align:middle line:90%
in "Align, Attune, and Ascend."
