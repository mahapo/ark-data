00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.370 align:middle line:84%
We are broadcasting from
The Conscious Life Expo

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.950 align:middle line:90%
here in Los Angeles.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And with healthcare
systems in the flux

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:84%
right now, which is definitely
what we're experiencing,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
my guest today,
Dr. Mark Mincolla,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:84%
is a natural healthcare
practitioner.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And he can offer a lot of
solutions for this flux

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.400 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
We need to learn more
about preventive medicine.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to learn more about
self care and self-healing.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Mark Mincolla,
who has been featured

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
on "Dr. Oz" and
many other programs,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
has combined the ancient
Chinese medicine art

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.364 align:middle line:84%
with cutting edge nutritional
science and energy

00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:84%
work, which we just
did a little bit of.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.669 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK MINCOLLA:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.234 align:middle line:90%
That felt great, didn't it?

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It felt so good.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I feel so energized
and so alive.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit
about our healthcare system

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're noticing these days.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:84%
What is the message that we're
receiving about healthcare?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Well, for starters,
the idea of preventive medicine

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much forgotten.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:10%
When you consider
only 1% of the budget

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.920 align:middle line:10%
is allocated for
prevention-- and you're

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:10%
talking about breast
exams, colonoscopies--

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.698 align:middle line:10%
we're not really empowering
people and teaching

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:23.600 align:middle line:10%
them to eat, how to
exercise and meditate,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:10%
do their Tai Chi, et cetera.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.782 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be a
little bit different.

00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well,
there's no funds that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:84%
are allocated in any type of
healthcare plan for, I mean,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:90%
chiropractic-- a little amount.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in
there for naturopathic.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's really
not any permission

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
for us to get any
of this covered.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: I'm not sure
there's a huge revenue

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:90%
stream for prevention.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.654 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-uh.

00:01:45.654 --> 00:01:46.153 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:90%
No there isn't.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.435 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Not to sound
cynical about it, but--

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: --it plays a role.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's why we need
to take care of ourselves.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: We need to empower
ourselves, take responsibility,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy the process.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: It's a lot of fun
feeling great, believe me.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Enjoy the
process, darn it.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:90%
So, all right.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about what you do.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.114 align:middle line:90%
What is a whole health system?

00:02:05.114 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MINCOLLA: Well first
of all, we really

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:10%
focus on the idea,
Lisa, that food really

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:10%
is medicine-- we're not using
that as a euphemism-- the idea

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:10%
that food actually has
energy, we have energy,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:10%
and there's mixing and
matching that takes place.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I always bring up the point
that folks in this culture

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
think about food from a
purely biological perspective,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.821 align:middle line:90%
from a chemical perspective.

00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Food is so much
more than chemistry.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Food is energy.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.509 align:middle line:84%
It's like we did
our little Tai Chi

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:90%
exercise before we got started.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Energy is the whole key here.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:84%
We produce energy that's
really powerful stuff.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:84%
When we're animated
with a lot of energy,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:84%
our health is betterr, our
immune system functions better.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:90%
The food plays a role.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
The attitude, the
mood, and the way

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
we operate our lives
at a mental level

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.144 align:middle line:84%
and a spiritual and
emotional level all

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:90%
play a significant role.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.105 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's one thing
that I'd love to learn from you

00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:84%
is how do you combine
these two techniques,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Chinese
medicine with

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:84%
the traditional cutting-edge
types of therapies?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
How did you get your
experience in this?

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Well,
for 32 years, I've

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
seen 60,000 appointments from
people from all over the world.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Don't ask me how
that ever happened.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I never imagined it in my
wildest dreams 32 years ago.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:90%
But it happened.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think it starts
off with compassion,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
heartfelt compassion, concern at
a conscious level for the well

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.967 align:middle line:90%
being of my fellow man.

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I go to work,
it's a heartfelt experience

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.154 align:middle line:84%
that I still bring to
my work, thank God.

00:03:23.154 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's never
been any different,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.028 align:middle line:84%
but I think the inspiration is
drawn from that perspective,

00:03:27.028 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and just paying close attention,
being super aware, conscious,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.049 align:middle line:84%
paying close attention
to the responses

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:90%
that you receive from patients.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:84%
What works, what
doesn't work, what

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
excites people,
what turns them on,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:84%
what turns their
level of wellness up,

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:84%
all have a really important
influence in teaching me

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:90%
where I've ended up.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the biggest
complaint that people have

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:90%
when they come to you?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
What's the biggest ailment
people have these days?

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Well
keep this in mind--

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of
terminally ill folks,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
a lot of folks with
neurodegenerative diseases,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:90%
very serious stuff.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
question, energy, fatigue,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:84%
memory, those are
key areas I think.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why?

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think?

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Where did
I put my car keys?

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hear things
like that all the time.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.005 align:middle line:84%
And people are really disturbed
and really upset about the fact

00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:05.835 align:middle line:84%
that they seem to not
have complete control

00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:90%
over their faculties.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:90%
They're stressed out.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Their minds are doing so much.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:84%
They're multitasking all day
long, way above their capacity

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
to manage their
lives efficiently.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a lot of stress that

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:90%
plays a significant role there.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.374 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So stress is causing
the fatigue and the memory loss

00:04:21.374 --> 00:04:21.915 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Yeah,
well, the operation

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.010 align:middle line:84%
of our nervous system,
the way our brain

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:84%
functions-- our brain, of
course, functions much better

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.524 align:middle line:84%
when the nervous
system is at peace.

00:04:28.524 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Not a whole lot of people
at peace these days.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of nervous systems are
ravaging the brain responses.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And people are not able to
kind of grasp a lot of things

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.281 align:middle line:84%
that otherwise they
would be able to.

00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:84%
They're busy getting
the kids to school,

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and they're surviving
economically in many respects.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.451 align:middle line:90%
And it's a tough life right now.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:90%
So you just described my life.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.123 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: [LAUGHS]

00:04:47.123 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe I could be a
patient for a minute here

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and ask you-- I'm tired, I'm
fatigued, I'm stressed out.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.875 align:middle line:84%
And what would
you tell me to do?

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: First of all,
there are four brain wave

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:90%
states that we produce.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.666 align:middle line:90%
One of them is called beta.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Beta brain waves
are what I refer

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:90%
to as a highway state of mind.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:90%
You're racing around.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You're late for work,
You're stressed out.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.139 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at your watch.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a beta brain wave state.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:90%
We don't want--

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't forget traffic.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Yeah, we
don't want to be there.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.632 align:middle line:90%
We do not want to be there.

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
There are deeper
states, of course,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
like alpha, which is more
of a meditative state, delta

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and theta, which are very, very
deep, deep relaxation states.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
We're told that if we hit delta
states just for 20 seconds

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.045 align:middle line:84%
a day-- 20 seconds-- we actually
reset our nervous system.

00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: So it doesn't
take a whole lot of time

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.643 align:middle line:84%
to actually hit that
really deep, deep level

00:05:29.643 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
and get some benefit out of it.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's inspiring.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: But
nobody's unplugging .

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's just plugged
in and going and going

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.735 align:middle line:90%
and going and going.

00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now let's
take 20 seconds here.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:90%
So what does that look like?

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what--

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: We sort of did it
before our interview today.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
what it looks like.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.724 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: It's a
matter of, yes, it's

00:05:42.724 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
as simple as just doing nothing,
just unplugging your brain.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Sure, meditation's great.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Yoga's great.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Tai Chi is great, et cetera.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So turn off the radio.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.722 align:middle line:84%
Can you do it while
you're in the car?

00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Absolutely.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.805 align:middle line:84%
I would encourage anybody
to do it anyway they can.

00:05:57.805 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is just to
simply do absolutely zilch.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Unplug, shut it down, and
let your brand recycle

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and your nervous
system recycle as well.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there anything
that you can focus on to quiet

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.442 align:middle line:90%
the monkey mind in that moment?

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Yeah.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.024 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's been some
remarkable research.

00:06:14.024 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Richard Davidson at
the University of Wisconsin

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:84%
has done some great
neuroplasticity research

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.460 align:middle line:84%
where they've determined that
the average person thinks

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:84%
between one and 3,000
thoughts a minute.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's all
unconscious thought.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So when we think these kind of
constant streams of unconscious

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
thought, not all of
them are positive.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
In many cases they're very
negative, and typically so.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So this negative
stream of consciousness

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
is not helping us to
relax or feel more at ease

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:84%
or more efficient at a
brain level, like we said.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of just
taking 20 seconds

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and shutting that stream of
negative consciousness down

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
helps us to reset and helps us
to kind of get back in place.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But his research
at Wisconsin was

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually
take four minutes twice

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
a day and utter a
positive mantra.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Now a mantra is often
referred to as words of power.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Like ohm is a very
powerful common mantra,

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
for example, that speaks
to the notion of a god

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:90%
energy in our lives.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But also, people can just
speak positive words.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.049 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gratitude and--

00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:10.965 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Gratitude.

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And sentences as
well-- I'm a genius was

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:84%
was of the more powerful
neurologically engaging phrases

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.799 align:middle line:90%
that they studied.

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: So I'm a genius.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I am the master of the universe.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Again, we don't have
to be accurate here.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.491 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do
is we have to have

00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
a dynamism and a positive
reflex in our wording.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So when our words are dynamic
and positive for four minutes

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.840 align:middle line:84%
twice a day over 16 weeks, we
reset from right prefrontal

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
to left prefrontal
consciousness.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that we are right
prefrontal dominant means we're

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.003 align:middle line:84%
worried, we're stressed, we're
late for getting the kids

00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:90%
to school.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that shutdown
that we're talking about.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So the stress levels
are really preeminently

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:90%
in that right prefrontal cortex.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.622 align:middle line:84%
The way we shift
for that dominance

00:07:45.622 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
to move over to the other
side, that confident,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
peaceful, well-balanced,
managed part of our brain,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:84%
is really shifted when we engage
in these four-minute spells

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:84%
twice a day of positive,
dynamic phrases.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.757 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you do
that within-- I mean,

00:07:57.757 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
there are times where I am
in the car with the daughter,

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:84%
late to school, and
I am stressed out.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.259 align:middle line:84%
And that sets her day up
for being stressed out

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and then it messes
up the entire day.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: It is contagious.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: It's like we could
be in a room of 25 people.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:84%
You could be on the
other side of the room,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
but if you're real
stressed out, you're

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
going to hit somebody's energy
on the other side of the room.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.995 align:middle line:90%
That's how energy is.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.456 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you break
the cycle in the moment?

00:08:19.456 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: I
think you just have

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:90%
to be conscious, for starters.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we're really
talking about here whenever

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
we talk about holistic
health in any capacity,

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it's diet or
the mental framework

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, it's all
about consciousness.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.042 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Mindful living is the
beginning of the process.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.875 align:middle line:84%
We often say there are
seven different states

00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:84%
We start off without
the awareness

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of some of these things
and not an inclination

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.134 align:middle line:84%
to think at a higher
level of awareness.

00:08:43.134 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But we can develop
that awareness.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.299 align:middle line:84%
And we can kind of
build on that awareness

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and develop it at a
much stronger level

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
to be more inclined
to say, hey, I've

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.260 align:middle line:90%
got to stop myself midstream.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.135 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going off at the
hip here, and I'm

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:84%
kind of getting very
neurologically overcharged

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:90%
and stressed.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.444 align:middle line:84%
And I need to kind of just
rein it all in right now

00:08:59.444 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:90%
and just shut it down.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say 20-second
periods, 20-second intervals

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:84%
of unplugging and
thinking about nothing,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.470 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you are
or what you're doing.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.386 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the human energy field

00:09:09.386 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to lead us
into some of the techniques

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to teach us.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:90%
What is energy?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:84%
How much energy do you we
radiate from our bodies,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
from ourselves?

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: It's been
measured at 0.025 volts

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:84%
at 10 Hertz of direct
current ambient charge.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.887 align:middle line:84%
So we're producing
a specific field.

00:09:28.887 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But of course, science
knows about it.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
We do electroencephalograms,
electrocardiograms, we do MRIs.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:90%
We know it's there.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.936 align:middle line:84%
So the reality is science
has acknowledged it.

00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
spend a whole lot

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
of time teaching us about it
and expanding on the properties

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and expanding on the
possible applications

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:84%
like we're talking
about here today.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I wonder why.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: We produce
an active field, though.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, I can
feel someone's energy when

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:84%
they walks into the room, or
an energy of a room changing.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But why isn't it more validated
in the scientific communities?

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: We're
dealing with phenomena.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.445 align:middle line:84%
And phenomena can't
really be addressed

00:10:03.445 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:90%
from a biochemistry perspective.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.935 align:middle line:84%
So chemistry is more
materially based, obviously.

00:10:08.935 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And energy-based
medicine is more

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
inclined to think in
terms of phenomena

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
as having to be understood
at a whole different level.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
You kind of mentioned
it a minute ago.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
You said you can feel when
somebody walks in the room.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.672 align:middle line:90%
Here comes Elvis.

00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Someone
walked in the room.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Somebody with
dynamism comes into that room,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:90%
you're going to feel it.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.814 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
palpable level of energy.

00:10:25.814 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
it's about, I think.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to use
meters or scientific data

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to kind of pick
up on that energy.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.085 align:middle line:90%
But you can surely feel it.

00:10:33.085 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Its presences is undeniable.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you said that we have
a certain field, a Hertz that's

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.629 align:middle line:84%
measurable that can emanate
from our physical body.

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just like a radio signal--

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.295 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: That's
exactly right.

00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --gets from a tower to
a station and then to the radio.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:90%
That comes from our bodies.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:84%
How do we use this energy field
that we have to clear disease

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.552 align:middle line:90%
and to raise health?

00:10:54.552 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Well that's
exactly the point

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
is that we do have this
remarkable thing called energy.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And we have an infinite
supply of this energy, OK?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:84%
There's no limitation
to this stuff.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It's pouring into us.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
We're part of this field
system, this multiversal field

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%
system of unlimited,
infinite energy.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's what we
consciously tune into

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.069 align:middle line:90%
and what we intentionally apply.

00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Most folks are not intentionally
or consciously tuned into it

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.859 align:middle line:84%
because, as you pointed out,
the cultures isn't really

00:11:21.859 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:90%
talking that talk.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But there are many of us now
that have been working at that

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:84%
and starting to kind of
test it and work with it

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.745 align:middle line:84%
and experiment on
our own with it.

00:11:29.745 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're not doing
brain surgery here.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:84%
You can work with somebody
at home that you love

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and just say, look,
let's play with energy.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.045 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's try.

00:11:35.045 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: And one of
the simple applications--

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:90%
we think about it again.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything has energy.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Food has energy.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:90%
You have energy.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So when there's an energy
interaction, like at a party,

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:84%
you meet some people, they
either you lift you up

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.145 align:middle line:90%
or they take you down.

00:11:45.145 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Food is the same way.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.311 align:middle line:84%
All energy is either a positive
or a negative reaction.

00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I always say energy has three
possibilities: too much, not

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
enough, and perfect,
right in the middle.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you're properly
aligned with somebody,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.178 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
feel a nice balance

00:11:57.178 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:90%
to hook up energetically.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.964 align:middle line:84%
Or with the food, you feel
great after you eat it,

00:11:59.964 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:84%
or you don't feel
good after you eat it.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes foods will
lift you up too high

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.917 align:middle line:84%
and make you kind of
nervous and anxious.

00:12:05.917 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Other foods will
kind of take you down

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and drain you and deplete
you and depress you.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.829 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of saying
that energy has these three

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:14.544 align:middle line:84%
applications: excess,
deficiency, and balance.

00:12:14.544 --> 00:12:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
work with these foods

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
by holding a food
close to our body.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
We're actually having
an energy interaction.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:84%
We can measure through
muscle testing.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So we produce this
magnetic field

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
that actually fills our muscles
with neuromuscular response.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Arm goes up about
shoulders height.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Make a fist.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Keep the elbows straight.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Hold the food
close to the heart.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Have a loved one
just tug on the arm.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Just gently tug at the wrist.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.742 align:middle line:84%
And if the wrist is weak and
brings about a weak response,

00:12:39.742 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that's a food that energetically
is not well matched.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For you.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: For you.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.942 align:middle line:84%
So you could take a loved
one to the grocery store

00:12:44.942 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and do this stuff
and have a blast.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.494 align:middle line:90%
Teach other people how to do it.

00:12:48.494 --> 00:12:50.868 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: I want to see the
entire world at the produce

00:12:50.868 --> 00:12:51.990 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: With muscles.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: I'm not going
to rest until that happens.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.244 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:12:55.244 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'll help you.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.315 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a few of
these energy techniques.

00:12:58.315 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We opened the show
with doing something

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:84%
that was turning
your hands backwards.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.525 align:middle line:90%
What was that technique?

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: That's an ancient
Daoist technique from China

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that actually is
referred to as weaving

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.842 align:middle line:90%
the web of universal protection.

00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
In front of our bodies,
in front of our hearts,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:84%
there's what they referred
to as a pericardium

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:84%
field, this field of energy
that you can't see visually.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But it exists right
in front of you.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's just sort of
your protection zone,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.924 align:middle line:84%
if you will, from ill
thoughts, ill intentions.

00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
People around you,
they may want to kind

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.264 align:middle line:84%
of stay centered
in the presence of.

00:13:28.264 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is your
protection field.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Your pericardium is your
field of protection.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:90%
So you want that plenty strong.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's said that it should
be 36 inches in depth

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.922 align:middle line:90%
for your full protection.

00:13:37.922 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you get stressed
out, you get deficient.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:90%
You're not eating right.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:90%
You're not sleeping right.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Your pericardium field
becomes deficient.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we do this little
exercise that we showed you--

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:90%
36 spins, left hand under right.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.355 align:middle line:84%
And you spin your left
hand over your right.

00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Your other left hand.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.105 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm just kidding.

00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS] Left
hand under right.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Left toward you.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Left-- no, no.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Left under right.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Now bring your left
hand toward your body.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: There you go.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.726 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: So now
you're doing this.

00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:05.963 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Perfect.

00:14:05.963 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And as you spin that, you're
actually enhancing or weaving

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
the pericardium field, which
is your field of protection.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great
stress technique.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is great.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.204 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:15.204 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So it increases
your energy field.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
This is great for conferences
like we're at right now

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:90%
where there's people everywhere.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Exactly right.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.695 align:middle line:84%
Well, it increases the
field that is actually

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:84%
designed to protect you
from the world around you,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.949 align:middle line:90%
from tension, from stress.

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we're constantly
interacting with other people.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And as we said a
little while ago,

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
you could be at the
other side of the room

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and pick up somebody's
something or other.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We're always picking
up something or other.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
We have a high
receptivity response.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can even pick
it up through the phone.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Absolutely right.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is protecting you from
the negative possibilities.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.605 align:middle line:90%
And this happens 36 times.

00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: 36 spins.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.184 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:42.184 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, something
else you were doing

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:90%
is opening the gates of heaven.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Opening and
closing the heavenly gates.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Was is that from?

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.014 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Which
is, again, it's

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:84%
another Chinese
exercise that says

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:90%
we're taking in good energy.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And we breathe in through the
nose, exhale through the mouth.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.234 align:middle line:84%
Again, you're letting the good
in and the not so good out.

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's energy that's
balanced that you're taking in,

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:84%
energy that's imbalanced
that you're releasing,

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
leaving you in a position at
the end of this little exercise,

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
you feel refreshed and
balanced out energetically.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I encourage
you to try it at home.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: And they work.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
And to play with it.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Now I wanted you to tell us
a little bit about anxiety

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.422 align:middle line:84%
and techniques that
you can do for anxiety.

00:15:21.422 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Yeah.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we did
on "Dr. Oz," we kind of

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
had fun with these
pressure points.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
There are three different
pressure points that I used.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
They're referred to
as pericardium points.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the pericardium,
that hard protection

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
in front of you from the
world from stress, et cetera.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So there are three
important points.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
One is on the upper
part of the wrist,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:84%
right about where I'm
pointing right here.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.185 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: OK.

00:15:38.185 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's pericardium 7.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Pericardium 7 is actually
a terrific insomnia point.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So folks who are not sleeping
well, their thoughts are

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:84%
buzzing and their busy
mind is keeping them awake

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.647 align:middle line:90%
from any kind of normal sleep.

00:15:50.647 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:90%
They think, what can I do?

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
What can I do right here in the
middle of a frustrating sleep

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:90%
period?

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.211 align:middle line:84%
Put pressure with your
thumb right in that point.

00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Leave that-- a
little bit higher.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:90%
No, no, the other way.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So you put pressure on
that pericardium 7 point.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
You're stimulating
an acupuncture point

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that actually helps
you to relax and get

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:90%
a better quality of sleep.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.829 align:middle line:90%
That's PC 7.

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:90%
That's an insomnia point.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Don't want to
fall asleep right now.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to
do that. [LAUGHS]

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: And
there's one right

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the hand.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
There's one right in
the middle of a hand.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:90%
It's pericardium 8.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.097 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
important stress point.

00:16:21.097 --> 00:16:23.055 align:middle line:84%
That's a general stress
point, so anybody who's

00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:84%
feeling any kind of
stress and saying,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.747 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the middle of my day.

00:16:25.747 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:90%
My day is overwhelming me.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of like dealing with
traffic and the whole nine

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:90%
yards.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.934 align:middle line:84%
Put some pressure right in
the middle of that hand.

00:16:31.934 --> 00:16:34.319 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about stress in
the body, like a back pain

00:16:34.319 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.825 align:middle line:84%
Are there places in
the body that can--?

00:16:36.825 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Yeah.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
There are, depending
on who you ask,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.506 align:middle line:90%
over 1,000 points in the body.

00:16:41.506 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:84%
It's depending on what points
you want to work with, too.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, there are definitely
physical stress points as well.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.961 align:middle line:84%
There's a great physical
stress point right

00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
at conception vessel 17, right
about where I'm pointing here.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.504 align:middle line:90%
Right in the chest.

00:16:51.504 --> 00:16:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Put pressure on
that point and you

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.302 align:middle line:84%
actually will help
your body to neutralize

00:16:55.302 --> 00:16:57.010 align:middle line:84%
the presence of general
pain in the body,

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:84%
whether it's emotional,
mental, or physical pain

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:90%
as well, by the way.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.595 align:middle line:84%
And if it's sore, if
that's sore in your body--

00:17:02.595 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: That's a good
point, because if there's

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
soreness or if you get tickly
or any of that kind of stuff,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
there's sensitivity in
that pressure point, that

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
means you really need
to work that point.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
Work it and put pressure
in there, acupressure,

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:13.687 align:middle line:84%
until it doesn't
tickle or hurt anymore.

00:17:13.687 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you say working
it, do you tap on it?

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:16.522 align:middle line:90%
Do you massage?

00:17:16.522 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you turn it in
a certain circle?

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.146 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: I just recommend
putting pulse pressure.

00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:84%
You Pulse in on it
and then release.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Pulse in then release.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.301 align:middle line:90%
Pulse in then release.

00:17:24.301 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And that starts to
move the meridian?

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.804 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: That's
exactly right.

00:17:27.804 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It activates the movement
of chi, or life force,

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.702 align:middle line:90%
in that area.

00:17:30.702 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
See, these meridian pathways
are like neurological highways

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.132 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:17:34.132 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And you just put
pressure on these points

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
to re-stimulate those points
that get blocked or broken

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Traffic will kind of
break down in these areas.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So you created something called
electromagnetic muscle testing.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.239 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: What I
did, first of all,

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.940 align:middle line:84%
is I took a lot of the
Chinese approach, which

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:84%
we've been kind of
discussing here.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to occidentalize,
contemporarize, westernize

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.169 align:middle line:84%
and simplify them for
the Western mind in ways

00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that we could start having
fun with these things.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Because right now there's
this East and West thing

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
is kind of two totally
different places.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.174 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
excitement that I

00:18:06.174 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
have around the idea
of kind of bridging

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:90%
the gap between these two.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
do that, I figure

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.450 align:middle line:84%
we had to simplify these
things and to kind of make them

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
more user friendly for
the average American.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So the muscle testing
system that I have

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
is actually a very
simple approach

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to tapping into
your energy field

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.314 align:middle line:84%
doing some fun
work with muscles.

00:18:22.314 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So again, like we talked about
with the food a minute ago,

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
you can hold food close
and check the resistance.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
You go to the grocery
store with a loved one,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
hold an apple or a pear, a peach
or a plum close to the body,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:90%
check the resistance.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:90%
But here's the other part of it.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
just utter words.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we can
either hold the food

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about,
the apple et cetera,

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:84%
or we can actually
call out the word apple

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and check the same resistance.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
We can do it with
you in a minute.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.165 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: But again,
the mind and the body

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
produce a unified
field of consciousness,

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:90%
a unified field of awareness.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It's what we call
innate awareness.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It's part of our
natural defense system.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.645 align:middle line:84%
If you're sleeping in
the middle of the night,

00:18:57.645 --> 00:18:59.395 align:middle line:84%
you're having a dream
that you're actually

00:18:59.395 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:90%
falling off a cliff.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Your heart rate goes
up, you perspire,

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:90%
your physiology is adjusted.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:90%
It changes.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It's responding to
something that's a dream.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not even real.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.522 align:middle line:84%
Yet your physiological
responses are engaged.

00:19:10.522 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people we have
this incredibly powerful

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.140 align:middle line:84%
defense system that has
to, when it's called upon,

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:90%
give an opinion.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:90%
It has to respond.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
It can't take
anything for granted.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's real
or not is irrelevant.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It's what it's
picturing, it's what

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.772 align:middle line:84%
it's influenced by
in terms of stimuli.

00:19:25.772 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So whatever stimulate
you hit it with-- I

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.400 align:middle line:84%
could have you close your
eyes and think about 9/11.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Your resistance is going
to get very weak of course.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.230 align:middle line:84%
When you think about somebody
you love very dearly,

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.146 align:middle line:84%
your resistance is going
to get really strong.

00:19:37.146 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So resistance is always
shifting and changing

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:90%
at the bioenergetic level.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:90%
But we're not listening.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.980 align:middle line:90%
We're not dialoguing with it.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Part of this whole issue to
me is the conscious awareness

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that it exists, just being
attuned to its reality.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.592 align:middle line:84%
And then secondly, to have
fun playing around with it

00:19:51.592 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:90%
and just experimenting.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
I actually think that's
a fantastic idea.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You can use this application
for anything from weight loss

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.332 align:middle line:84%
to increasing energy to shifting
your mood and your focus.

00:20:03.332 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Absolutely.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.081 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk
about a few of those.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So say, for example,
someone desperately

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:84%
needs to lose weight
for health reasons,

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and they have a very hard time
with the willpower around food.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Know what to eat,
read all the diets

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and can't physically
break the patterns.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Can you start to converse
with yourself and the food?

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:90%
How would you suggest that?

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.376 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: It's
a great question.

00:20:27.376 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I think we have two different
forms of intelligence.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:90%
We have learned intelligence.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:84%
We go to school, we
have coaches, et cetera.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So we learn from an intellectual
approach to learning.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:90%
We also learn from innate.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So innate is something that we
engage from within ourselves,

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.025 align:middle line:84%
sort of a stream of
natural consciousness.

00:20:45.025 --> 00:20:47.054 align:middle line:84%
You're crossing a
busy city street.

00:20:47.054 --> 00:20:48.220 align:middle line:90%
You make an innate decision.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Do I run?

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Am I safe right now?

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Now's the time to go.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:90%
You're across the street.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.785 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to hold back
because it doesn't feel right.

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.128 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: So we're
using innate all the time.

00:20:56.128 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we shop
as consumers, do I

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:84%
look better in
green, red, or blue?

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to buy the blue shirt
because I look better in blue

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:90%
with my eyes.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're always making
these decisions innately.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So we do have two different
sources or streams

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:84%
of information
that we work with.

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.361 align:middle line:84%
So I say that you have this
natural stream of awareness

00:21:11.361 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that says, look, if I check you
out for apples, peaches, pears,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.624 align:middle line:84%
or plums, and I muscle test
you by calling the words out,

00:21:18.624 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:90%
you have to have an opinion.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:84%
That's part of how
your neurology works.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's a
neuromuscular response,

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:84%
meaning that your nerves
within your muscles

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:84%
charge them up or
charge them down.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.398 align:middle line:84%
You either have a
positive effect--

00:21:28.398 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
like if I mention
9/11, negative effect.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:84%
If I mention somebody
you love, positive

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:90%
effect-- same thing with foods.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So it can be
anything arbitrarily

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.941 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
have an opinion for.

00:21:35.941 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, your nervous
biofeedback system,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
your neurological
biofeedback system,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.087 align:middle line:84%
has to have an opinion about
everything to keep you alive.

00:21:44.087 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our defense system.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So back
to the weight loss

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
question, can you, rather
than checking with the foods,

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:90%
can you check in with your body?

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to have a clear
relationship with your health

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.782 align:middle line:84%
and the way you want to
look in order for what

00:21:58.782 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about to work?

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.615 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: No.

00:22:00.615 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:90%
This works 24/7/365.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.115 align:middle line:90%
It's always engaged.

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
From the day you're born to
the day you leave the planet,

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:90%
it's engaged.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.396 align:middle line:84%
Our innate awareness is part
of the human defense system.

00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a biofeedback
defense system

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that has-- like we said, even if
you're dreaming about something

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
completely artificial,
you still have

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
to have that reaction,
that response.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.056 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take any chances.

00:22:18.056 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:90%
It leaves nothing to chance.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:84%
It's always active as
our protective device

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:90%
neuromuscularly so.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that when
we're looking at diet,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.217 align:middle line:84%
I would call out, for
example, at breakfast,

00:22:29.217 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
one ounce of protein,
two ounces of protein,

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:90%
three ounces of protein, four.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.686 align:middle line:84%
At whatever level
of protein you fail,

00:22:33.686 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:90%
the arm's going to go down.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Because
you have an opinion

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:90%
neurologically about everything.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So I actually contour
diets, customize diets,

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:84%
with the accordance
of direct corollaries

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.859 align:middle line:90%
to the right food for you.

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we start off
by testing you for apples.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Oop.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:90%
Apples failed.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
That's not on your
diet because that's not

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:90%
an efficient food for you.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: So we're
only going to start off

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
with a list of foods that
are mapped in as those most

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
efficient energetically,
acceptable foods for your body

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:90%
chemistry.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.897 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, we then detail
a complete dietary system.

00:23:00.897 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Breakfast-- do you want protein?

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.035 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, you do.

00:23:03.035 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:90%
How many ounces of protein?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.600 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three, four,
or whatever ounces

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.730 align:middle line:90%
it might muscle out to.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So we muscle test you
for the entire details

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
of breakfast, lunch, and
dinner, proteins, carbs, fats,

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:84%
ounces of water, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Food allergies?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%

somebody for food allergies

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.500 align:middle line:90%

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So can you test me for allergies
to different types of foods

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:28.955 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Absolutely.

00:23:28.955 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can we show

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:29.796 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Absolutely.

00:23:29.796 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you do
it from right there?

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I have to muscle
test you, though.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK That's OK.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Can I do it sitting down?

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Sure you can.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, great.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Let's
have you raise up.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's make a fist--
a little bit higher.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sorry.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: A little bit high.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.356 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to tug at the wrist.

00:23:40.356 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So if I said, Lisa, you
think about something

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.543 align:middle line:90%
like apples, peaches, pears.

00:23:45.543 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.515 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Raise up again.

00:23:47.515 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Apples, peaches, pears.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So pears wouldn't be the best
of that particular group.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-uh.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: If I said something
like grains-- oats, rice,

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:57.709 align:middle line:90%
wheat.

00:23:57.709 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Deathly allergic to it.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: Wheat.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:90%
So in other words--

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Deathly.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Watch
what else we can do.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
We can actually appeal
to the mind body

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:84%
in a dialoguing sense,
your mind body awareness,

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%
your field of awareness.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So I can say, what about,
how negative 1 to 10,

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.899 align:middle line:90%
is wheat for you specifically?

00:24:11.899 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:90%
How negative is it?

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's get a detail here.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Because you're
capable of doing that.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.176 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:16.176 --> 00:24:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: So wheat is a minus
1 out of 10, minus 2 out of 10,

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:84%
minus 3, minus 4, minus 5, minus
6, minus 7, minus 8, minus 9,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:90%
minus 10.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:90%
So you went the full distance.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, yeah.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.928 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: How bad is wheat?

00:24:25.928 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a minus 10.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually reverse
that polarity of intention.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.011 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:31.502 align:middle line:90%

How about, like,
white fish, like cod

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.680 align:middle line:84%
fish or haddock or
something like that?

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.137 align:middle line:84%

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:90%

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Beef-- minus 1, minus 2, beef
is minus 3, minus 4, minus 5,

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:90%
minus 6.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:90%
About a minus 6.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So again, all we're
doing is we're

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.920 align:middle line:84%
dialoguing with your mind
body at an energetic level

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to tap into what your
energetic opinions are

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:90%
at the neurological level.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Brilliant.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's talk about illness.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.857 align:middle line:84%
If I'm suffering with
a cold, and you think

00:25:15.857 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And you've all the symptoms
for the common cold, lots

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
of flus going around
the flu season,

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
can you dialogue with the
energetic system of the body

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:30.460 align:middle line:84%
to wellness in that moment, when
there's a virus or bacteria?

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.724 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: You absolutely
can do that to the degree

00:25:33.724 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:90%
that you would be amazed at.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we can
tap into-- I'd first

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:90%
of all say the word "virus."

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Arm goes down, you've got one.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:41.449 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:25:41.449 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: OK?

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.716 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
how does your body

00:25:43.716 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:84%
respond to the
notion of a virus?

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're immunologically
defended well and strong

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.765 align:middle line:84%
and have no virus
in your system,

00:25:51.765 --> 00:25:53.475 align:middle line:84%
your arm's going to
stay nice and tight.

00:25:53.475 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
If I call out, "virus,"
and you have a virus,

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.141 align:middle line:90%
your arm goes down.

00:25:56.141 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Then I would ask you at what
level does this virus exist?

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Minus 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7-- whatever

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
level it is kind of
defines at a greater detail

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.987 align:middle line:84%
just how negative, how
virulent, how powerful,

00:26:07.987 --> 00:26:09.945 align:middle line:84%
how hard this virus is
hitting you specifically

00:26:09.945 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:90%
at this point in time.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So we can get a minus--
obviously a minus 10 virus

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.539 align:middle line:90%
is pretty nasty.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.996 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: All right.

00:26:15.996 --> 00:26:17.119 align:middle line:90%
A minus 1, not so bad.

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We can also, then, tap into a
variety of different medicines.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
What I do my work every
day is say, OK, I'm

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.615 align:middle line:84%
going to call out five or six
different anti-viral medicines,

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:84%
over-the-counter, natural
antiviral medicines

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:90%
to see how you respond to them.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.266 align:middle line:84%
And then test those
positive 1 to 10.

00:26:29.266 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So I might look at
something like lauric acid

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:84%
from coconut, which
is an anti-viral.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Monolaurin is a terrific
antiviral medicine.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: So I'd
call out monolaurin.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
You get a positive
response for monolaurin

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:90%
for your given virus.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to know how
positive it is.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Is it minus-- is it
plus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So I look for a plus 10
for a natural medicine

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:84%
for any bacteria, virus,
mold, anything like that.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Can somebody hand
me a cell phone?

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.929 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to check that
on the body, just to see what

00:26:54.929 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
the reaction of cell
phones would be.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:90%

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:84%
The difference between on

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%

>>MINCOLLA: Well, again, I
have a system in whole health.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
The whole health

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.282 align:middle line:84%
designed to help a

00:28:16.282 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:84%
a reader to work
with somebody they

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
love, to tap into the levels
of strength and weaknesses

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:84%
in the body, so their organ
systems, first of all.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.240 align:middle line:90%
We don't treat the disease.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
We treat the
fortress, the patient.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's a matter of
what I always like to say,

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.970 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
treat the smoke,

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:90%
you want to treat the fire.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so the
human treatment.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.438 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: So we have
a fortress in here

00:28:36.438 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that's capable of doing some
remarkably miraculous work,

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.197 align:middle line:90%
provided it's up to snuff.

00:28:40.197 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:84%
When people don't eat
properly over a period

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.937 align:middle line:84%
of many, many years, stressed
out like we talked about,

00:28:44.937 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:84%
don't get their sleep,
don't get their rest,

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
compromise in diet, nutrition,
body, mind, and spirit,

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:84%
we want to test their body
field, their organ field:

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.350 align:middle line:84%
liver, kidneys,
gallbladder, lungs, spleen.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Where are the weaknesses?

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.315 align:middle line:84%
How weak are they,
minus 1 to minus 10?

00:28:59.315 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So we go through a
diagnostic breakdown

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.731 align:middle line:84%
of all the different
areas in the body that

00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:90%
are potentially weak.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And after we find that
the spleen or whatever,

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:84%
the kidneys, or whatever
it might be is sensitive,

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
how sensitive is it,
minus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
The minus 10 weaknesses
are the areas

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
you want to focus on
bolstering and strengthening.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.389 align:middle line:84%
So not to focus on the disease,
to focus on those areas that

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:84%
are most sensitive that
allowed the disease

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.117 align:middle line:90%
to crawl inside the fort.

00:29:21.117 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then you can focus

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Strengthen
the root reference.

Disease, as it's being

00:29:42.542 --> 00:29:43.458 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's different.

00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Every disease is different.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Every virus is different.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Migraines
are-- I'm glad you

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.540 align:middle line:90%
brought that up-- debilitating.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's not a lot
of solutions for those.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.280 align:middle line:84%
What would you tell
someone who has?

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Once again, once
again, why is it happening?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.227 align:middle line:90%
Where is the root reference?

00:29:58.227 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
If you have gallbladder
sensitivities,

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that's a classic,
classic marker.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:84%
90% of all migraine
headaches are

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.170 align:middle line:84%
rooted by gallbladder
sensitivities, gallbladder

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.071 align:middle line:84%
weaknesses or bile
duct sensitivities.

00:30:08.071 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
People that don't manage
fats and lipids in their diet

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.361 align:middle line:90%
particularly efficiently.

00:30:11.361 --> 00:30:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a weakness in
the bile duct or gallbladder,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.580 align:middle line:84%
your fat metabolism
isn't very efficient.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
often have very sensitive

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:90%
migraine responses.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So how would you correct
something like that?

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Strengthen
the gallbladder.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.295 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: By?

00:30:23.295 --> 00:30:25.753 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: With things like--
I would test them obviously,

00:30:25.753 --> 00:30:26.980 align:middle line:90%
like we talked about.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But typically you'd find things
like barberry root, which

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:84%
is a tremendous bile stimulator,
tremendous gallbladder

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Also things like homeopathic
medicines, like nat phos,

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:84%
nat sulph, lycopodium, really
important natural medicines

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that actually help the
gallbladder and help one

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.590 align:middle line:84%
get rid of migraine
headaches through

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that weakened gallbladder
by strengthening it.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend
chiropractic, body adjustments

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever or no?

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.940 align:middle line:84%
You think you could
do that through--?

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.565 align:middle line:90%
>>MINCOLLA: No.

00:30:52.565 --> 00:30:55.307 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean, I think that
the idea of global wholism

00:30:55.307 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:90%
is a brilliant idea.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I think the idea of
having a group of folks

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.225 align:middle line:84%
that you work with as part
of your health care team

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.836 align:middle line:84%
is always a great
situation that I

00:31:02.836 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
would encourage
people to engage.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So you think that you
can pretty much self

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:84%
correct any system
in the body using

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
the very specific relationship
that you have to your body

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:90%
and paying attention to that.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Remember
we first talked

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:90%
about the idea of prevention.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.322 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:19.322 --> 00:31:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: We're
really not zoomed

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:90%
in on this idea of prevention.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're not really maximizing
our potential for prevention.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: And
you think about it.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.480 align:middle line:84%
If we could teach
America or inspire

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.670 align:middle line:84%
America, like Whole
Health does, to try

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.800 align:middle line:84%
to tune into your body at
really sensitive levels

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to preemptively
protect and defend yourself

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.450 align:middle line:84%
before disease
happens, I mean you

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
could make a
tremendous difference,

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:90%
take a big bite out of crime.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.947 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:31:41.947 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:84%
What was the biggest
response that you

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.160 align:middle line:84%
had after being on
the "Dr. Oz" show?

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.702 align:middle line:84%
What was the popular
opinion of that?

00:31:46.702 --> 00:31:48.326 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Oh, people
really loved it.

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I got flooded with
emails, and I think

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:84%
a lot of folks-- the book
sales went up, of course.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did they
like it because you

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.150 align:middle line:84%
were restoring and
empowering people

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:57.815 align:middle line:90%
in terms of their own health?

00:31:57.815 --> 00:32:00.000 align:middle line:10%
>>MINCOLLA: Yeah, I think
the most powerful message

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.050 align:middle line:10%
we get back as a
feedback from the public

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:10%
is that people love
the idea of two things:

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.346 align:middle line:10%
number one, being taught
that energy is everywhere,

00:32:07.346 --> 00:32:08.220 align:middle line:10%
energy is everything.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.060 align:middle line:10%
>>MINCOLLA: People are
really ready for the message

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.710 align:middle line:10%
that energy is where it's at.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.337 align:middle line:90%
They're finally ready for that.

00:32:13.337 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
aware of the fact,

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.040 align:middle line:84%
acutely, that they've
been sort of minimized.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I always say,
imagine having lived

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:21.340 align:middle line:90%
half a life for your whole life.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the proposition
we're dealing with.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what it
feels like, doesn't it?

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MINCOLLA: Because in
1921, we gave Einstein

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.730 align:middle line:10%
a Nobel Prize for teaching
us that energy and matter are

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:10%
interconvertible
and transferable.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Then we turned around and lived
100 years of Newtonian life.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So either we take back the
Nobel Prize or we wake up.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very well said.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes, energy is everything.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: Energy
is everything.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've learned so much.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.703 align:middle line:84%
So you can work with your
body in so many different ways

00:32:45.703 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to bring your energy
up, to clear disease,

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of anxiety, to find
out what your allergies are,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.230 align:middle line:90%
to cure the common cold.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:53.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all possible.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MINCOLLA: To tune in with
your higher consciousness

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.087 align:middle line:84%
about who you are

00:32:56.087 --> 00:32:57.170 align:middle line:90%
