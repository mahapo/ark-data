>>LISA GARR: Are you
curious about the afterlife?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Did you know you can safely
have an out-of-body adventure

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.815 align:middle line:84%
without a traumatic accident
or a near-death experience?

00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
and joining me

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
is the author of "Adventures
Beyond the Body,"

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:90%
William Buhlman.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Over the past two
decades, William

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.200 align:middle line:84%
has guided hundreds of people
with his personal system

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:84%
of safe, self-initiated,
out-of-body adventures.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.390 align:middle line:90%
This is so fascinating.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.773 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM BUHLMAN: Oh,
it's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I am super
curious about this.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Why would someone want to have
an out-of-body experience?

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well,
simply for answers.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
We live in a society
and a culture inundated

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:90%
with all these belief systems.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, people
really want to know

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.983 align:middle line:90%
the truth for themselves.

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
to attain that is

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:84%
to have your own
profound experience.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.210 align:middle line:84%
People talk about spirit,
and soul, and source, and all

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
these concepts, but it's
an intellectual construct.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Imagine having your own ability
to obtain your own answer

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:90%
through personal experience.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this subject
is just so important.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's really
what it comes down to.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Anyone I've ever interviewed
is so full of conviction

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
when they've had their
own personal experience.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
It's so great to be able to
have that personal conviction

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:90%
that you know is true.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh yes.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Have you had an
out-of-body experience?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I've shared with my
audience that I've

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.962 align:middle line:84%
had the near-death
experience and so forth.

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Have you experienced that?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: I've had
many over the years

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
because back in the '70s I
learned how to self-initiate

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:90%
the experience.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine had an
out-of-body experience.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And this was not on my radar.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:90%
I was not a believer in this.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But he had this profound
experience spontaneously.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It changed his life.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:90%
We were in college at the time.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.028 align:middle line:84%
And he'd come to
me with this, and I

00:02:15.028 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
wanted to experience what he
experienced because it was

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:90%
so profound and life changing.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So I found there
were methods that you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
could self-initiate out-of-body
experiences and do it safely.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So I actually practice
these techniques.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And over a period of--

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
it took 20-- on the 24th day,
I had my first experience,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:90%
and it was--

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:90%
I can describe it briefly.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: But I was doing
this technique, which

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I call the target technique,
and I'm laying down every night

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:90%
as I'm going to sleep.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And one night, after every
night doing this program,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:90%
I awoke and I felt differently.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And I reached out my
hand, and my hand actually

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:90%
entered the wall.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it hit me,
oh my god, this is real.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:90%
I've done it.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought of standing,
and the next thing I knew,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing by the foot of the
bed looking at this lump, which

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:90%
was my body.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And as I scanned, I'm in
awe, I'm in shock, really.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, it is
real, it is real.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked
around, I noticed

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
there was somebody actually
appeared to be watching me

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that was a
non-physical resident.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And that, to be quite
honest, it was shocking,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:90%
and I snapped back into my body.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
first experience.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:90%
But it was life changing.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
That one experience opened
up this whole new world.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was in
college studying sociology

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and psychology, and I
felt like running out

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
through the streets saying,
oh my god, people, there's

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.145 align:middle line:90%
other dimensions.

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's exactly--

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: And we can go there.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
We can be empowered to
experience this for ourselves.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to depend
on books anymore.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I got
started in the early '70s,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and then I just became almost
obsessed with the topic

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to do it more and
learn more and experience more.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All of that
without LSD, you know?

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: No, no drugs.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The whole-- right?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: No, that's--

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean,
Timothy literally

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.368 align:middle line:84%
had to go through all
those experience with all

00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
the mind-altering
substances, but you actually

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:90%
did it yourself.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.977 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned you
found some material

00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:20.019 align:middle line:90%
when you were in college.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
What was that called,
the what method that you

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:90%
had your initial OBE with?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, the
first method that I used

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:90%
was the target technique.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Target-- what is that?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: It's a very simple
technique where you imagine--

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
you select three targets in your
home that are remote from you.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It could be in someone
else's home, also.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you're laying
down meditating or before

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
going to sleep, you
imagine yourself

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.120 align:middle line:84%
walking to these
objects, these targets,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:90%
and you become immersed in them.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
You focus your state
of consciousness

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:84%
away from your body
and on these targets

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:90%
and as you're falling asleep.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And ideally what
happens is that focus,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
that constant
focus will initiate

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness wants
to go where we focus.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:90%
We do it all the time.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.160 align:middle line:90%
We don't think about it.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:90%
You think of shoes.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:90%
You go to the shoe store.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Daydreaming-- yes.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yeah.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:90%
But now that is--

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:90%
I teach, well, over 25 methods.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But this is one of
the methods that

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:90%
has become very, very popular.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:90%
over the last--

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a good
beginner method.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes,
yes-- easy to do.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't take
any special training.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So are you thinking
if you're in your bedroom,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
you imagine the kitchen,
or are you imagining, like,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Italy or somebody else's house?

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.622 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where in proximity
do you put these targets?

00:05:44.622 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: I recommend
that people do something

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:90%
they're familiar with.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
painting you may have

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
made of something, a
sculpture, something

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that you're personally
imbued with.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Your cat can be a target.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be an
inanimate object, but something

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that you know extremely well
and you can hold your attention

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:90%
upon it.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- let me just
break this down for a second.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So you were aware of the fact
that your body was still there,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that you were
cognizant, and that you

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
looked down on your body
and then saw another being.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you said you
approached the wall.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Did you go through the
wall with your hand?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.035 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: No, I never
went through the wall.

00:06:23.035 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I just left my body and
saw this individual.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.690 align:middle line:84%
But in many
occasions after that,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I've walked through
walls and other things.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: We're
non-physical beings.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what we truly are.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:90%
We have the ability.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.943 align:middle line:84%
It's endless abilities to
explore within ourselves.

00:06:40.943 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, this
sounds amazing,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so excited that
you can actually teach

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:90%
people to do it themselves.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've been
doing for 25 years now

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and eight years at
the Monroe Institute.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is teach people
the techniques, the mindset,

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
which is very important, how
to control the techniques,

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
how to control your
state of consciousness,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
how to get the
most out of it, how

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
to turn an
out-of-body experience

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.412 align:middle line:84%
into a profound,
life-changing experience.

00:07:11.412 --> 00:07:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: People are searching.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I did a Google search
for the near-death experience,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.140 align:middle line:90%
and 50 million searches come up.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I know that near death is
different than out of body.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.218 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain the difference?

00:07:23.218 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, a near-death
experience is, of course,

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:90%
a result of temporary--

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Tragedy.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: --death
of the individual.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And part of-- one of the
elements of a near death

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and one of the essential
elements is the OBE.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:84%
People report this
leaving of their body.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But what many people
are unaware of,

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's important
for people to know,

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:84%
that you can have an
out-of-body experience

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and self-initiate it.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:90%
They can be initiated by trauma.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But most people have
them spontaneously.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And matter of fact, they're
10 times more prevalent

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.287 align:middle line:90%
than near-death experiences.

00:08:01.287 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Out-of-body experiences?

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes,
much more prevalent.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:90%
People have them all the time.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And often, because society
doesn't teach what it is

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening,
they remain unaware.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what category
to put this experience in.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, I understand
that through your experiences,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
over 25 years of
teaching this, you

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
had a health crisis in
the middle of all of this.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Explain what
happened and what you

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:90%
discovered through that crisis.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, in
2011 I was diagnosed

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
with stage four cancer of
the lymph nodes and tonsils.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: I went through
the traditional medication

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:90%
and medical procedures.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But because I-- I feel it
helped me tremendously.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:84%
When I was recovering
from cancer,

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I was having spontaneous
out-of-body experiences,

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and I found them to
be incredibly healing.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.210 align:middle line:84%
On one experience-- and
I didn't initiate this.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened--
fully conscious

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and I found myself, for
lack of a better word,

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle line:90%
floating in a pure white cube.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was inward, no
doors, no windows,

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and I was inwardly instructed
to stay there and float.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I was
bombarded with healing

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
energy or vibrations for
extended periods of time

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:90%
out of my body.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And I feel strongly that--

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
this happened for
about, oh, a month.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every night, every day?

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: About three,
four times a week.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And I feel strongly
that that helped me.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I recovered very quickly
from this serious surgery.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:90%
I had a full neck dissection.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I recovered quick
enough that I was back

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:84%
doing six-day workshops
in four months.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:90%
So I think that--

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.148 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: With even more of a
passion about the topic, right?

00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, absolutely,
because it was so amazing.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: So there's a
lot of elements in this.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:90%
This is a deep subject.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:90%
It covers a lot of ground.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Because it
gives us an opportunity

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
to connect with our
inner self, and that's

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.650 align:middle line:90%
where all healing really begins.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.713 align:middle line:90%
It's all within us.

00:10:16.713 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm so glad you shared
that story for anyone who's

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
going through any type
of traumatic healing

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:84%
variance that they understand--
especially when you get

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:84%
into the medical
system, and they

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
are brilliant with
what they know to do,

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and they do what they
know to do with the body.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you can
assist that in going

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
into this other
realm or other level,

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:84%
you can expedite your
healing or discover

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:84%
some of the reasons
behind it even more.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh yes.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think that's
what the journey's about.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And you
can open to healing.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are not open.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:90%
It's in our energy bodies.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Healing-- a lot of people
feel that sickness or illness

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:90%
starts from within.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.360 align:middle line:90%
It's energy blockages.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, and if that's
the case, imagine--

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
if all energy blockages and
illnesses start within us

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and then manifest
outward into our bodies,

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
imagine if we could go
inward like the shaman have

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:90%
been doing for 10,000 years.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.360 align:middle line:90%
What have shaman been doing?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:90%
They move into an altered state.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And they move the energy
of the individual.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:90%
They remove blockages.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
They do it in a
ceremony, of course,

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
where they're using feathers
and all these other things.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But they're moving
your energetic

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're opening
up your energy field

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:90%
so that healing can occur.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:43.020 align:middle line:84%
We can do this ourselves when
we initiate these experiences.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.157 align:middle line:90%
It's quite self-empowering.

00:11:44.157 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's incredible.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:84%
It's shown up through
history so many different.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, yes.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so let's
talk about what

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:90%
you do at the Monroe Institute.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is so fascinating
to me that you guide people

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:90%
through these experiences.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes, I teach
a six-day workshop--

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
it's called OBE Intensive,
and it is intense--

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:84%
where each individual go
through a series of-- each day

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
there's five pretty much
hour-long exercises.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Each individual-- only
24 people can attend,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're each in
an isolation chamber.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And I speak to them, and we
have a very, very fine-tuned

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:90%
audio system.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Each individual I speak to
through their headphones.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And we use sound technologies,
like Hemi-Sync and spatial

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
angular technologies
to help people get

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:90%
into an altered state easier.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And then through
these programs, I

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.860 align:middle line:84%
guide them to go
deeper and deeper

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and to enter into these
states of consciousness that

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:84%
allow each individual to have
their own profound experience.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's important.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.492 align:middle line:90%
There is no this is it.

00:12:58.492 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no
philosophies attached.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Each individual has the ability.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:90%
They have their own experiences.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They come away with
their own conclusions.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
is so needed today.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no overview
that this is it

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.767 align:middle line:84%
because each individual
decides what's real for them.

00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and we
have a beautiful picture

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.808 align:middle line:90%
here of the Monroe Institute.

00:13:22.808 --> 00:13:24.303 align:middle line:90%
It's in West Virginia.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: It's in Virginia.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Virginia.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: In Faber,
Virginia, central Virginia--

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.100 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, beautiful
200-acre property.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's like
out-of-body tourism.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, many people
go every year, by the way.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.825 align:middle line:84%
Here's a picture of the chamber
that you're talking about.

00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Do people--

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: This is
the research chamber

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that we use for brainwave
studies, by the way.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
That is the primary
chamber used.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Each individual is
in another chamber.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
It's similar in many respects,
but it's not copper lined.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually 24
individual isolation chambers

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:90%
we call CHEC units.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And the unit on the
screen is the one

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:90%
that's used for research.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, why would
you copper line it?

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.697 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: To keep out
all the EM radiation.

00:14:15.697 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.447 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Absolutely.

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:84%
You want a null point
so that people are not

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
influenced by any kind of
cell phone or radio waves

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.087 align:middle line:90%
of any kind.

00:14:26.087 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because that
definitely impacts our field.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.003 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes, yes.

00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Our fields are
constantly impacted.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we can do
to minimize that when

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.680 align:middle line:84%
you're in meditation,
it's always good.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So when they go into
it, what is the purpose

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of the individual units?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:84%
You can't do this
with other people?

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Basically so
that everyone is isolated

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
so there's no aura
interference with other people.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:90%
It's darkened.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It's almost-- you
have a curtain.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You enter in, and you can
make it completely dark.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And all you have
is your headphones.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same concept
of the float chambers

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:90%
that are so popular.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:84%
That each individual
has that ability

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.565 align:middle line:84%
to be in their own kind of
float chamber, so to speak.

00:15:12.565 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And then it's a
curtain, so you're not

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
enclosed in a tiny room if
you're claustrophobic, right?

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: You can open the
curtain if you choose to.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: But each
individual-- and there's

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.030 align:middle line:84%
each person has her
own, which is important.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It makes it quite--

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the only place
in the world that provides

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:90%
this individualized training.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, you are a
trained hypnotherapist.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you take people
through these guided journeys

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.648 align:middle line:90%
out of their body, right?

00:15:42.648 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: To the
best of my ability,

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I guide them to have their
own experience, whatever

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:90%
that may be.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- when you
open up, things happen.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:84%
People have past
life experiences.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:84%
People have contact
with loved ones.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Anything can happen
once you open up.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But my primary
goal in my class is

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to teach them not only how to
have an out-of-body experience,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
but how to control it and
get the most out of it.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know of several people
who have gone through this,

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and some of the advanced work,
they actually go and they

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
help people in other
communities or other dimensions

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.610 align:middle line:84%
where they help
finding lost children,

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and they really do
incredibly profound work.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes, yes.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:37.380 align:middle line:84%
There's 16 major workshops,
all of them specifically geared

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to a topic, whatever it may
be, contact, for instance,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:90%
retrieval, past lives.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Retrieval?

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yeah.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.552 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is
that, soul retrieval?

00:16:48.552 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes, soul retrieval.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.642 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Lost souls?

00:16:51.642 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well,
yeah, or assisting

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:90%
those that may need assistance.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the classes.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm the instructor
for the out-of-body--

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.286 align:middle line:84%
how to self-initiate
out-of-body experiences.

00:17:03.286 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:84%
So you can go and
help souls that

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:10.043 align:middle line:84%
might be stuck or in
shock still and bring--

00:17:10.043 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Absolutely.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --them into
different dimensions.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Absolutely.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole idea.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
about self-empowerment,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.530 align:middle line:84%
being self-empowered so
that you have the ability

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:90%
to obtain the answers yourself.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like a soul soldier--

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yeah.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would somebody have
this experience otherwise?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
If they just want to go
through self-exploration

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they have
a fear of death,

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:90%
would that help with that?

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:39.753 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:39.753 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:90%
There's so many benefits.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Fear of death is one of the
great fears in our society.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huge.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And imagine, once
you leave your body-- my fear

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:90%
of death is completely gone.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I know because you
know from experience.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:90%
We've been lied to so much.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:84%
We've been told
we are our bodies.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
We've been told that our brain
is the source of consciousness,

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:90%
which these are lies.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we've been
told that we have

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:90%
to depend on belief systems.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:90%
And what does that lead to?

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Nothing but manipulation,
whether it be religious,

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:90%
or political, or whatever.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Once you have your
own experiences,

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
you're free from that.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It's so self-empowering
because you have the ability.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:90%
You know from experience.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:84%
You no longer have to be the
pawn of some other person or--

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Agenda.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Propaganda.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Which, as we
know, is very common.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And that we are under
the numbness of it

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:84%
all the time, that
we're constantly

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
led to believe what
we're led to believe,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's never an
opportunity to get

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
outside that massive
mind control,

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I can call it, and
actually get out

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of that to see what reality
is really like for yourself.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, it is
incredibly exciting.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I can't emphasize this
enough, because finally,

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.190 align:middle line:84%
finally you get to know
through personal verification.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:90%
And I tell you the truth.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
What I found very quickly
in even my first few years

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.540 align:middle line:90%
was simply this--

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:84%
everything I had been led
to believe and learned,

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.890 align:middle line:84%
they were all flawed
or just flat out lies.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
from childhood.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Almost every belief
that I was spoon fed

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be, let's
just say, a manipulation.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And
that's an eye opener.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Give me an example.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: This whole
idea of hell, this whole--

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I was brought up Lutheran.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was inundated
with this idea of hell

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and you had to be saved, you had
to believe in this to be saved,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and this whole agenda
of you had to do this,

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:90%
and the wages of sin are death.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:90%
I found the opposite to be true.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:90%
We're immortal.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:90%
We're powerful.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:90%
We create our own realities.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Finally, through your own
experiences, you get this--

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
finally, you can
look at this entire,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:84%
let's say, the drama that
we're involved on planet Earth.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And you realize, oh
my god, there's no truth here.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just the drama.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.370 align:middle line:84%
It's education
through experience.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But once you realize
what you are--

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:84%
what's wild is that most people
will live to be 90 years old.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They have no clue where they're
going at the moment of death.

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's sad.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:90%
That's flat out catastrophic.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: People plan
every moment of their day,

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.195 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
know where they're

00:20:40.195 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
going at the most
important moment of life

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:90%
and this transition.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:90%
That's unacceptable.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Imagine if we could
have those conversations.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm going through this
experience with my father,

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and he's having massive
health challenges,

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and he's a scientist,
hardcore scientist,

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:84%
40-year orthopedic
surgeon, before

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
that military, MASH unit.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to have this
conversation about, well,

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
how would you like to
experience communication

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:90%
on the other side?

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And he can't hear it
because he's a scientist.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:84%
God bless him for
being a scientist.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, thank god.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:90%
We need him.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But those are the
conversations--

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
rather than this whole business
of death with the mortuary,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and the casket, and the
colors that you want to wear,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and the--

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really?

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Can we just have
as much emphasis

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
put on how would you
like to send me signals?

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
What should I look forward
to know that you're there?

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.770 align:middle line:84%
How would you like
me to keep you

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
alive through this
level of consciousness?

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a look here at
William Buhlman at the Monroe

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Think of
this for a moment.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Seven billion people
on the planet and we

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.835 align:middle line:84%
don't know where we're headed
at this pivotal transition

00:22:00.835 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness we call death.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Think of it.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
We're on this 80, 90-year-old
journey, and we have no idea.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a form of insanity.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.097 align:middle line:84%
We have everything
planned, tomorrow.

00:22:16.097 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, you know exactly
what you're going to do.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, you know exactly
what you're going to do.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But here an entire
species has no idea

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.200 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen at
the moment this transition

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness occurs.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:90%
That's unacceptable.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It's insanity it's
a form of amnesia.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.230 align:middle line:84%
We also, when you think
about it, dig deep,

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:90%
we don't even know what we are.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to explore
this in a moment.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where we
come from as consciousness

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:90%
before we were born, do we?

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:90%
We're suddenly here.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.390 align:middle line:84%
We accept the culture and
the society we're given,

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:90%
and we do the best we can.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we connect to and
adapt to the social norms

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and hope that
they're correct, hope

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
some give us solace, some of
us give us hope, some of us--

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:90%
but there's no answers given.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
That I find completely
unacceptable because,

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.510 align:middle line:84%
as powerful spiritual
beings, we have the ability

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:84%
to obtain the answers
for ourselves.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But we have to become
explorers of consciousness.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us
individually to learn

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
the methods, the
techniques so we

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:84%
can explore deeply within
ourselves because the answers--

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
the old "X-Files,"
I believe it was,

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:90%
said the answers are out there.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Totally false.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:90%
The answers are in here.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wouldn't that be so much
more beneficial if we spent all

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:90%
that time--

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, now
that we're speaking

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
about this, one of the
things that I teach

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote about
in my latest book

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
is simply this-- death can be
a launchpad of consciousness.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.520 align:middle line:84%
We've been trained to believe
the falsehood that death

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:90%
is this terrible experience.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:90%
We're immortal.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is
no death, really.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a
facade, the illusion of it.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:90%
But death is an opportunity.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
We can take death and
turn it into a launchpad

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.520 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
At the moment of death, we
can turn this into this event,

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:84%
in other words, by focusing our
consciousness, for instance,

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:90%
"Higher Self Now."

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if, instead of
being fearful of death,

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
we begin to focus on
our spiritual essence,

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:84%
or whatever term, and turn
that into an affirmation.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Spiritual essence now.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.078 align:middle line:90%
Higher self now.

00:24:50.078 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
name of your book.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: And then use that.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists have been
saying this for centuries.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing new.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's been lost in
our society and culture.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
We've been sold this bill of
goods about what death is.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like the page of a book.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What we're talking
about here isn't just

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual conversation.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:90%
This is extreme practicality.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh yes.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.023 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And plus, it
puts things in context.

00:25:22.023 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it does.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Once you experience
what you really are,

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.470 align:middle line:90%
your whole reality changes.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Your perception of
reality changes.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:90%
What's important to you changes.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And your emphasis, then,
through life changes.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Your trajectory in life
changes because you're

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
no longer obsessed with
the acquisition of things

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
because you realize, oh
my god, I'm immortal.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I may have been here
before 50, 60 times.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm an evolving soul.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.165 align:middle line:90%
This is the importance--

00:25:55.165 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I always say that we only take
one thing with us when we die,

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's our state
of consciousness.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:84%
The only true valuable asset
we own, that we possess,

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:90%
is our state of consciousness.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
doesn't go with us.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It's all just this--
it's just kind of junk

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:17.412 align:middle line:84%
that we surround ourselves with
for a temporary period of time.

00:26:17.412 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have this a
lot as children, though.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we're younger,
we have this ability

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.270 align:middle line:84%
to float in and
out and to really

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:84%
live in a state of
consciousness before we

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
get bombarded with so many
responsibilities and the fear.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that
children are more

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
prone to these
out-of-body experiences?

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh absolutely.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I write about this
in my second book.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:84%
In "Secret of the Soul" I
have a survey of 16,000 people

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
from 42 countries who
responded, and many of those

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:84%
ended up being adolescent
and younger children,

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:84%
or parents would send
me their experience.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I added an entire chapter
of nothing but children.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Children are
incredibly open to have

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous out-of-body
experiences up to puberty.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But now looking
back, I had them.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.690 align:middle line:90%
But what did my mother tell me?

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, William, it's just a dream.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
thing we're told.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not taken seriously.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just
blanketed over.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But children are very
open to these experiences.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.230 align:middle line:90%
I have twin boys.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
young, they would

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.033 align:middle line:90%
have out-of-body experiences.

00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And they would actually
tell me in the morning

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:84%
they were playing ball
with my dead father-in-law.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was dead
for a couple years.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And they would, "Pop Pop
come and we played ball."

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of experiences
most parents would have just

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, that's just a dream.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I have two sons, and
they're both having

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:90%
the same experience.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.395 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to blow that off.

00:27:49.395 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's fascinating.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: But children
are incredibly open,

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:90%
but they shut down.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.998 align:middle line:84%
As they move into puberty, all
humanity seems to shut down.

00:27:59.998 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I understand why.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I have a teenage
daughter, and I see it.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I see it happen where the
outside influence becomes

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
more important than the inner
for a certain amount of time.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.087 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And
definite socialization.

00:28:13.087 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, that's what it is.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And culture
indoctrination.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We all went through
it, and look how we turned out.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:21.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's not such a good thing.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So the study that you
did is fascinating.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So you took 16,000 people,
and you asked them what?

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well,
16,000 people responded

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:90%
to a list of questions.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:84%
There were 10 questions about
out-of-body experiences,

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
about whether they
had one, what it

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:84%
was like, what kind of
precursor, kind of energies

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
surrounded that
event, in other words.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And then what I did is compiled
it and put it into a format.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:84%
What's amazing is
how many people

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:84%
have had the same
type of precursor.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So precursor in terms
of an event that happened

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
in their life or
something that--

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Energy events.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
For instance, before an OBE,
it's quite common for people

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:84%
to experience vibrations,
sounds, buzzing sensations,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:90%
seeing through close eyelids.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
You're laying in bed at night,
and people blow this off,

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing
through closed eyelids.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
You're already phasing
out of your body.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
You're shifting
into another state.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:90%
People don't realize what it is.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:84%
A typical-- and this
frightens people--

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:90%
sleep paralysis.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Sleep paralysis is a prelude.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to
stay calm and know

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:84%
how to do the right
procedure, you

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
can easily initiate an
out-of-body experience

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
from sleep paralysis
or when you're

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:90%
seeing through closed eyelids.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.682 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wait, don't we already
do those things when we sleep?

00:29:49.682 --> 00:29:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how is
that considered

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience?

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: No, I'm
saying this is a prelude.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: But this
is the precursor.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, people have
these events all the time,

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:90%
but they don't react to it.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they remain
focused on their physical body

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and their physical sensations.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so you're saying we
already go into sleep paralysis

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.360 align:middle line:90%
when we sleep, of course.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But to take
that to the next level.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
how you get into--

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.910 align:middle line:90%
that's the gateway to the OBE.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes, that's
one of the gateways.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And you stay
calm, and you focus.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.450 align:middle line:84%
You disconnect your
conscious, your awareness.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
You de-focus off the body,
which locks you into the body,

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and then you begin to
focus, like door now,

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:84%
or what is commonly
a technique used

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
by many people around the
world, simple roll now.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:84%
You imagine yourself
rolling away

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.890 align:middle line:84%
from your body,
mentally rolling.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like your
consciousness isn't-- like,

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.630 align:middle line:84%
you're in a sleeping bag, and
the sleeping bag is your body.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:90%
And you are mentally rolling.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the procedures people

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:84%
use to initiate
a fully conscious

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.020 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experience
from sleep paralysis,

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:03.210 align:middle line:84%
or seeing through closed
eyelids, or the vibrations.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So once you start that process,
rolling outside your body,

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.070 align:middle line:84%
do you have a
destination to go to?

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, I train
everyone, number one,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:90%
go away from your body.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Pick a locale, door now.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Make it simple.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Make it repeatable.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there, then
you just reinforce that state

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're in, and
then there's no limit.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That-- but
there might be.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:84%
What if there are realms that
you might not want to go into,

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:84%
realms that have a lot of hate
or that have a lot of fear?

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you want to stay
tethered to the ones that

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:90%
are of higher--

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.437 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, absolutely.

00:31:45.437 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:84%
But people go where their
consciousness is focused.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.290 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important
to learn about the subject,

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.110 align:middle line:90%
so you're not fear based.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's good to get
educated about the topic.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have
a six-day workshop

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and I've written four
books, because I want

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:90%
people to be knowledgeable.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I want people to be fearless,
because we're immortal.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:90%
What's there to fear, really?

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:90%
We're immortal beings.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:90%
We're incredibly powerful.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:90%
We create our reality.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.400 align:middle line:84%
When we leave our
bodies, we're entering

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:84%
into a thought-responsive
dimensional space.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.803 align:middle line:84%
And we were even more
powerful in that space.

00:32:23.803 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we have
this chart here

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:84%
that talks about the
evolution of consciousness,

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and it shows that there's
a baseline of where

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.480 align:middle line:90%
your physical body.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:90%
And it starts there.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So basically everybody has
this level of evolution.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about this?

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, we all
go through a series.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the purposes
of this is to give

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:84%
an idea of just how small
the physical world is.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.240 align:middle line:84%
The physical world--
the common theory

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:84%
is that there is this
curtain between the physical

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and the non-physical,
like they're equal.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:84%
We know from-- I know from
45 years of experience,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and we know from thousands
of people having OBEs,

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
the physical world
is a thin epidermis

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:10.460 align:middle line:84%
of the multi-dimensional
universe, the thin outer crust.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
experiencing around us.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.330 align:middle line:84%
We think this is a
center of reality.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the outermost
portion of reality.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And as we leave our
bodies, whether it

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:84%
be through meditation
or whatever the method,

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.560 align:middle line:84%
we're actually entering, we're
shifting our consciousness

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.530 align:middle line:84%
inward into the
non-physical realms,

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.740 align:middle line:84%
this other dimensional
spaces of the universe.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
reason for this chart.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:44.140 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to convey
these multi-dimensional spaces

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:90%
in a two-dimensional diagram.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is
we are already there.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.820 align:middle line:90%
We're multi-dimensional beings.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:90%
We're not physical.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:90%
This is a temporary experience.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we have an
out-of-body body experience,

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.850 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
beginning to experience

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:84%
our essence of ourselves
or parts of ourselves.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we go from
the physical body

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.710 align:middle line:84%
to the conscious mind,
which is consciousness,

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:84%
and then the subconscious
mind is outside of that

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:16.000 align:middle line:90%
or above that?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: It's all parts of us.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:19.330 align:middle line:90%
We're multi-dimensional beings.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.540 align:middle line:90%
So there's no order.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, there is,
but it's a matter of density.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:84%
As we go inward, the universe
becomes less and less dense

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and more and more
thought responsive.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.120 align:middle line:84%
We know that from
thousands of people

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.130 align:middle line:84%
having out-of-body
experiences and having

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.969 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of experience.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:43.300 align:middle line:84%
This chart kind of gives
us an overlay of it,

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that when we meditate,
we're shifting inward,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.780 align:middle line:90%
but we're not externalizing.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Generally, you stay within,
but you're moving into,

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.870 align:middle line:84%
let's just call it, other
aspects of ourselves.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But during an
out-of-body experience,

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:84%
we're shifting our consciousness
and, for a brief period

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:84%
of time, exteriorizing
that aspect.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the old
concepts of body, mind, spirit

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:90%
are primitive and inaccurate.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.400 align:middle line:90%
We are multi-dimensional beings.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:84%
We exist on many
different dimensions.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you have an
out-of-body experience,

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.360 align:middle line:84%
you're shifting
your consciousness

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:84%
into an energy body that
is already an aspect of us,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.910 align:middle line:90%
of all of us.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, the
wonderful people who meditate

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and also some of our
incredibly enlightened beings,

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.010 align:middle line:84%
gurus and whatnot,
understand how

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:39.190 align:middle line:84%
to elevate into these
different dimensions.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But we call them the Maharishi,
or we call them gurus.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.690 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that we
can do this ourselves,

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that we can have the experiences
that these enlightened beings

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:90%
have had.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.427 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:35:53.427 --> 00:35:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Maybe they spend more
hours doing it, of course.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.512 align:middle line:84%
But we can do this
at our own level.

00:35:57.512 --> 00:35:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: We definitely can.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you look back
through history,

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
if you look back through
all the biblical, all

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.110 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual text, whether
it be the Bible or the Koran,

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.170 align:middle line:90%
there's a common element.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:84%
These mystics and saints,
what were they actually

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:17.740 align:middle line:84%
doing when they always talk
about, I was in the spirit?

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.790 align:middle line:84%
For instance, Revelation begins
with, I was in the spirit,

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and then he goes on to describe
this non-physical city.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:29.815 align:middle line:84%
Obviously he's not
in his body anymore.

00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:32.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a common thread
throughout the history

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:90%
of biblical and spiritual texts.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Mohammed talks about seven
heavens or seven dimensions.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist have been
talking about this

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:90%
for hundreds of years.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:84%
"The Tibetan Book of the
Dead" talks about this.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:49.000 align:middle line:90%
This is the common element.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a thread running
throughout the entire history

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual texts.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
society and what culture.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:03.580 align:middle line:84%
If you analyze it, if you throw
away all this, let's call it,

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.500 align:middle line:84%
linguistics involved, what
were they experiencing?

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.400 align:middle line:90%
They're leaving their bodies.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're using your own
dialogue, their own language

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.620 align:middle line:90%
to explain these.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:90%
That's why this is important.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And the out-of-body experience
is that central experience

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that mystics have talked about
from the beginning of time.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But they framed it in their
own cultural experience.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.495 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: I mean, in "Second
Corinthian," St. Paul talks

00:37:31.495 --> 00:37:33.340 align:middle line:90%
about the third heaven.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can we connect to
our own level of guides?

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Do they really--

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I know mine exists because
I wouldn't be here today.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.950 align:middle line:84%
But have you experienced that
when people come back through

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.710 align:middle line:84%
their out-of-body experiences
that they say, I met a guide,

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.510 align:middle line:90%
I met a--

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.310 align:middle line:84%
People have all kinds
of profound experiences.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.890 align:middle line:84%
They actually meet
personal guides.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:58.640 align:middle line:90%
They meet loved ones.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.920 align:middle line:90%
I write about this extensively.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I write about meeting
my deceased mother

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:90%
on multiple occasions.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.920 align:middle line:90%
But people do this.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:84%
What's important is that you
don't have to be special.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.790 align:middle line:84%
We've been
conditioned to believe

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that these people,
these mystics,

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.480 align:middle line:84%
were all-- they were special,
they had special abilities,

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.300 align:middle line:90%
and that we're not special.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But some do.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that the ones
that talk to the dead, that

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.240 align:middle line:84%
have these incredible abilities,
like James Van Praagh,

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
they really can go
into other dimensions.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But they have a lot
more practice at it.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.775 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: 20, 30, 40
years of practice

00:38:37.775 --> 00:38:39.650 align:middle line:84%
at it-- and if we did
that, we would probably

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.470 align:middle line:90%
wind up with the same thing.

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes, some
people are definitely

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:90%
more open to it than others.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we do talk about
demystifying death here

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:84%
because we both
kind of been having

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.230 align:middle line:90%
these experiences for a while.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
ones you leave behind?

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my greatest
fear is my daughter

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.130 align:middle line:84%
not having the same experience
of knowledge that I have

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.030 align:middle line:90%
because she's so much younger.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.507 align:middle line:84%
But we leave behind young ones,
or we leave behind loved ones,

00:39:07.507 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and they go through
a lot of suffering

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:84%
because they have experienced
the death rhetoric,

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.485 align:middle line:90%
I guess I'll call it.

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:16.902 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my daughter, when I
tried to talk to her about it,

00:39:16.902 --> 00:39:17.790 align:middle line:90%
wasn't ready.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I said, can we communicate
through flowers?

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And she just started crying,
and she wasn't ready to talk.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.850 align:middle line:84%
That's hard when you're just
starting this conversation,

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but although I love flowers,
and she loves flowers.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.260 align:middle line:84%
My mom and I have had
this conversation.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:36.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll communicate through
clouds because we love clouds.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But that's just 101
on how to do this.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.210 align:middle line:84%
How do you get engaged
with this conversation

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.390 align:middle line:84%
with a child that might
not be ready for it?

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, I think it's
all about you have to just

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:90%
start where they--

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.720 align:middle line:84%
you have to come from
wherever they are.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Every child is different.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
key that you have

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to find out, where is the state
of consciousness of the child?

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And then try to
get to their level

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and how to approach them
to bring this down to earth

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:90%
for them, that love continues.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I think this is another
important aspect

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:12.390 align:middle line:90%
of that consciousness.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.350 align:middle line:90%
We continue.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness continues.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Nothing dies.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And that we even-- it's not
just in an airy-fairy way,

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:84%
but that if I was
to die, my sons know

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that my consciousness, my love
for them is always present.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a real
comfort to know that.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's
important, I think,

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.230 align:middle line:84%
for children to
begin to be trained

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:84%
in a way in how to become
more self-empowered

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and not to be sucked into
the belief systems that

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.630 align:middle line:84%
are so prevalent
and then to teach

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:51.020 align:middle line:90%
them to be more open to ideas.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And I think all that counts.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If you see
so many people going

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.600 align:middle line:84%
through these
out-of-body travel,

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and if you see them connecting
with loved ones that

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.640 align:middle line:84%
have crossed over,
again and again

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and again you see and
you hear about this,

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:84%
then it would be possible,
then, if I were to pass on

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and my daughter
were to go into one

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.540 align:middle line:84%
of these out-of-body
experiences,

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.520 align:middle line:84%
she could connect
with me there, right?

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Absolutely.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.500 align:middle line:90%
And that happens.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:84%
People connect
with their children

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I've received letters
of, actually--

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that people, women
who were pregnant that

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.340 align:middle line:84%
had an out-of-body
experience actually

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.680 align:middle line:84%
had communication with their
child before they were born.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: I didn't want to
get into too much of this.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did that.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.400 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: I mean,
people experience this.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: We have an ability
to open up and experience

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:44.110 align:middle line:84%
our children on a
whole different level.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they open up to
that experience even more so.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So as we.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.870 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, are going through
these different levels,

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:56.670 align:middle line:84%
these journeys, can we go into,
as you say, our higher self

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and start to work with our
future and our destiny?

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Can we start to really not
manipulate, but grow or become

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:10.990 align:middle line:84%
more of our fuller potential
in these other dimensions?

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:12.870 align:middle line:84%
How can we use this for
developing ourselves

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:13.600 align:middle line:90%
personally?

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yeah.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.243 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
number one things.

00:42:16.243 --> 00:42:17.910 align:middle line:84%
When you have an
out-of-body experience,

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.500 align:middle line:90%
many people don't know that--

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people think you're
just walking through walls

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and doing stuff like
this, very physical like.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.390 align:middle line:90%
That's not the purpose.

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe initially
that's interesting.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.340 align:middle line:84%
What I teach people to do-- and
I'd like to share an experience

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I had that kind of
brings it down to earth.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:37.120 align:middle line:90%
This goes back many years ago.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.990 align:middle line:84%
I had a traditional
out-of-body experience

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:43.410 align:middle line:84%
where I did it an exit,
then I moved to the door.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.680 align:middle line:84%
But instead of just traveling
laterally, what I did

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.400 align:middle line:84%
is I focused on stabilizing
my energy field,

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and I just demanded
higher self now.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was I suddenly--

00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and this is difficult
to try to convey.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But I found that my entire
state of consciousness,

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.350 align:middle line:84%
my perception of it was
I'm shooting through--

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.260 align:middle line:84%
moving through layers
of color and light

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's shockingly fast.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I know I'm floating

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.830 align:middle line:84%
in this sea of white
light, of stars

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and pure white light, pure
consciousness and love.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:25.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's impossible.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:29.800 align:middle line:84%
No words that I have can't
really convey this experience.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But I was connected
to everything

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.470 align:middle line:84%
for that moment, seemed
to know everything.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But this is so important
because you know.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Beliefs are no longer
needed because you know.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.920 align:middle line:84%
You move from a
believer to a knower,

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:90%
and that's a huge shift.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, then, things
fall into context.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly I return back
to that state of consciousness.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.550 align:middle line:90%
This is repeatable.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.760 align:middle line:90%
This is the same--

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.580 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, I
did a conference,

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.890 align:middle line:90%
and it was all yogis and myself.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's up
there for a weekend

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.200 align:middle line:84%
describing their experiences,
somati and all the--

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and I realize, all these people,
didn't matter what culture they

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:84%
come from and what training,
everybody was basically

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.300 align:middle line:90%
saying the same thing.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:84%
They're having these
profound inner experiences.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to convey them

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:29.230 align:middle line:84%
in a very limited form
through their language,

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.340 align:middle line:84%
but they're all having
the same experience.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Call it source.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Call it soul.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.640 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Labels don't matter.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.515 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: But
you suddenly know.

00:44:38.515 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And it puts
everything in context.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, what's important--

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.677 align:middle line:90%
daily life changes.

00:44:46.677 --> 00:44:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is so interesting.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can go
into these expanded

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.270 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness, but you
can also go into experiences,

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:57.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe, if you have a writer's
block or if you're trying to--

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.840 align:middle line:84%
say if you want to
find a new career path

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.900 align:middle line:84%
or figure out something
you can't figure out

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.170 align:middle line:84%
in this current reality,
how to make a job change

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:90%
or how to make even--

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yes.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, for
lack of a good--

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.580 align:middle line:84%
how to make more
money or whatever.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:16.050 align:middle line:84%
If you want to learn
that, do you ever

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:19.790 align:middle line:84%
take people on journeys
into that level

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.650 align:middle line:84%
of how to get to the
next level of thinking?

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, I train people
how to react and how to respond

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and the benefits,
and what can you do?

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.210 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
title of this book

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.540 align:middle line:84%
come to me from an
out-of-body experience.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like suddenly everything
was clear, and I knew it.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Your future already-- future
is nothing but thought forms.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:47.220 align:middle line:84%
When you leave your
body, we are, in a way,

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.690 align:middle line:84%
entering our own
potential energy future

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.230 align:middle line:84%
because we're entering into
dimensions of our own thought

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And all around
everybody, they're

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.470 align:middle line:84%
carrying thought forms
of their own future.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what psychics read.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: And that's how
they can pick up on things.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So during an
out-of-body experience,

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:15.930 align:middle line:84%
you have an opportunity to
connect with and mold, actually

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:17.130 align:middle line:90%
mold.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:21.150 align:middle line:84%
If you stay calm and
are totally focused,

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:25.920 align:middle line:84%
you can begin to powerfully
mold a new future,

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:84%
a new dynamic
future for yourself.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we've
talked about this, now,

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.870 align:middle line:84%
from most of the show,
and I want to guide people

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:36.000 align:middle line:90%
through an experience.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And say what you say,
door now, window now,

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:41.920 align:middle line:84%
or how to get to
the next dimension.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And we can experience this
a little bit here with you.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's go through this.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK?

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: OK, sure.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I know we're
not going to go

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.580 align:middle line:90%
into a deep state of trance.

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: OK.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.290 align:middle line:84%
One way, one simple way,
is just close your eyes

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and take a deep
cleansing breath.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And just center yourself.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that a
white cleansing light

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:06.870 align:middle line:84%
is coming down from above
and relaxing every part

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:08.760 align:middle line:90%
of your body and mind.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And just allow yourself
to go and relax

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and to go as deep as possible,
letting go all thought.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the simple
techniques that you can do

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.610 align:middle line:84%
is to imagine that there
is a boulder before you,

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.040 align:middle line:90%
a big stone.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And on this stone,
we are going to begin

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.680 align:middle line:90%
to carve an affirmation.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to use
the power of our mind.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So first imagine this
boulder, this stone, or block,

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.750 align:middle line:84%
or marble, and we're going
to carve an intention.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And this intention
will be, now, feel

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:84%
yourself carving
each letter, now,

00:47:53.670 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:84%
N-O-W. I have an OBE,
meaning, of course,

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.920 align:middle line:90%
out-of-body experience.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.620 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine, if you
wish, in this experience,

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that you have a
chisel or a laser,

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's carving each
letter into the stone,

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:21.380 align:middle line:84%
making it powerful,
making it permanent.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're carving
your intention.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Intention is so incredibly
important in our lives.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Now I have an OBE.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And you hold this intention
as your last conscious thought

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.100 align:middle line:90%
as you drift and let go.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And you repeat this
until you drift off

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and allow your body to just
drift away, letting go,

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:56.770 align:middle line:84%
releasing all thought
until it becomes

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:59.410 align:middle line:90%
a permanent part of you.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And by doing this and by
repeating it, it's simple,

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:08.020 align:middle line:84%
it's easy, and you
repeat this every night

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.820 align:middle line:90%
as you're falling asleep.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And hold it as your
last conscious thought.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:19.240 align:middle line:84%
This has been proven to
initiate fully conscious

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:90%
out-of-body experiences.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:24.167 align:middle line:84%
And then you can go on
your journey from there

00:49:24.167 --> 00:49:28.010 align:middle line:84%
to where you want to go, if it's
to create a different future,

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.970 align:middle line:84%
a different reality, or
go down a certain path,

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:36.880 align:middle line:84%
or imagine a healed body or a
connection with a loved one.

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.960 align:middle line:90%
You can go to all sorts--

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.315 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Absolutely.

00:49:38.315 --> 00:49:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -- of different realms,
or possibilities, I should say.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: There's no limit
because we're immortal souls

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.658 align:middle line:90%
with no limits whatsoever.

00:49:47.658 --> 00:49:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the
difference between that,

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.760 align:middle line:84%
the out-of-body experience,
and actually just

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.920 align:middle line:84%
going into intention
setting and meditations?

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Is it the same thing, really?

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: The first
step is the same.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:02.230 align:middle line:84%
The difference in an OBE
is that people typically

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.390 align:middle line:90%
feel an exteriorization.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:08.860 align:middle line:84%
They feel this
experience of separation

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:13.120 align:middle line:84%
on some level from the body
where they no longer feel

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.530 align:middle line:90%
connected to the body.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that important?

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: For
many people, it is.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.320 align:middle line:84%
You can have
profound experiences

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.260 align:middle line:84%
without feeling,
of course, this.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying,
generally, that's where

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.670 align:middle line:90%
the term comes from.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get too deep
into this whole concept,

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:34.030 align:middle line:84%
but you can have in-the-body
experiences, as well, just

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:37.480 align:middle line:84%
by shifting your consciousness
through your multi-dimensional

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:38.560 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
two exteriorize.

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what yogis
have been teaching forever

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:48.760 align:middle line:84%
through deep trance
meditation and through mantras

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.450 align:middle line:90%
and intention.

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:52.100 align:middle line:90%
It's the same process.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.850 align:middle line:84%
The only minor detail is this
feeling of exteriorization.

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you say
the word "now," "door now,"

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.240 align:middle line:84%
or "OBE now," or
"higher self now,"

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.020 align:middle line:84%
is that an anchor
or a gateway into--

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.880 align:middle line:84%
is there an intentionality
with that word?

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.797 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Absolutely.

00:51:10.797 --> 00:51:13.240 align:middle line:84%
The idea-- most
people are fixated

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.800 align:middle line:90%
on their physical bodies.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And you have to train
yourself to begin

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:21.370 align:middle line:84%
to project or direct
your consciousness away

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:22.570 align:middle line:90%
from your body.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:25.480 align:middle line:84%
For our entire lives, we've
been totally focused--

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.363 align:middle line:84%
most people have been totally
focused on their bodies.

00:51:28.363 --> 00:51:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Survival.

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Yeah.

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
break that trend.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:33.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to break
that conditioning.

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea of door
now and other easy techniques

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.160 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to focus your
conscious awareness away

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:84%
from your body so that you have
your own profound experience.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
essential nature of it.

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And also, that's where the
verification comes from.

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It's when you're in
your body, many people

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.960 align:middle line:84%
find it more difficult
to verify, where was I?

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.410 align:middle line:90%
It's meditation, then.

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:05.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a meditator.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.870 align:middle line:90%
I love meditation.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But to me, out-of-body
experience is just more--

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:13.580 align:middle line:90%
it just ups that game more.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: It's more
exciting for me and others.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, do you recommend
writing down your experiences

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.470 align:middle line:90%
or recording them afterwards?

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:21.553 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:52:21.553 --> 00:52:23.650 align:middle line:84%
It's so important
to keep a journal.

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:26.650 align:middle line:90%
I strongly believe in journal.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I have boxes of journals.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, just
so you can remember.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: Because it helps
to condition and program

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.840 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious mind to
accept this more fully.

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to reprogram
ourselves, essentially.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a lot
of incredible resources

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.160 align:middle line:90%
here, as well.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
meaning to ask you,

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:47.080 align:middle line:84%
what is your biggest
why that you do this?

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.900 align:middle line:90%
What's your biggest reason?

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Answers.

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, my biggest why--

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I want the answers
to everything.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to know,
absolutely know where

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, what that
reality is like,

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:90%
not some nebulous that's heaven.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.110 align:middle line:90%
I want to know.

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I want to know
where I come from.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
my real trajectory is.

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.720 align:middle line:84%
What's my evolution,
and where am I headed?

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Where am I going?

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.687 align:middle line:90%
I want to know these things.

00:53:11.687 --> 00:53:12.860 align:middle line:90%
I want to know the purpose.

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:15.523 align:middle line:90%
I want to know it all.

00:53:15.523 --> 00:53:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, so many things.

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, William.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.290 align:middle line:84%
You're such a fountain
of information,

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and you demystify the
out-of-body experience,

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and the out-of-body
traveling and journeying

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.080 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing is
incredible for people.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.465 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much for that.

00:53:31.465 --> 00:53:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BUHLMAN: Well, thank you.

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:33.460 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, thank you so much
for sharing this experience

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:36.570 align:middle line:90%
with me.
