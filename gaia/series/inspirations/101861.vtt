[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.140 align:middle line:84%
We are broadcasting
from Denver, Colorado.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give you a
few quotes from my guest, Mike

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Dooley, his new book called "The
Top 10 Things Dead People Want

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:90%
to Tell You."

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
dead people could talk,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:90%
this is what they would say.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:90%
They would say, we're not dead.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.340 align:middle line:90%
We are here.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:84%
We are ready for
this, but you're not.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing a
few of them here.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Your dreams really
can come true.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
These sound like
the things that I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
would want to hear from my
best friend, much less somebody

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:90%
who has crossed over.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Joining me is international
bestselling author,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Mike Dooley.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:84%
He has over 600,000 people on
his Notes From the Universe.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:84%
These are free postings that
come in your email box right

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
at the right time,
just as if Mike's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:90%
looking over your shoulder.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.850 align:middle line:90%
So great to have you here.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE DOOLEY: Thanks
Lisa, great to be here.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, tell
me first of all

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.184 align:middle line:84%
about the Notes
for the Universe,

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%
because they are
so wildly popular,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.966 align:middle line:84%
and 600,000 people receive
those every single day.

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is your
ritual in writing those?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Where do you come up
with these really great

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:90%
poignant, timely phrases?

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Well,
in the beginning,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to receive
something like this.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I started writing at a
really low time in my life.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I was looking for my place.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:84%
We had just
liquidated a company.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were just simply
motivation from Mike,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:84%
notes from Mike
in the beginning.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And those were never as
popular as when I finally

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
capitulated to
this inner feeling

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
of writing from the
universe's perspective.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I could then
say more and let it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
be more impactful if it was
the universe, rather than

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
some dude, Mike,
who is he anyway,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
writing to complete
strangers around the world.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And once I started
writing as the universe,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:90%
I saw the levity, the fun of it.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I
take overly seriously.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the mouthpiece--

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For the universe.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It's
exploded in popularity.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have developed kind of
a writing style ritual, if you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
will, that's similar
or parallels what I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:90%
teach in "Deliberate Creation."

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Number one, all
manifestations come

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
about when you have
an end result in mind,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:90%
and you act on it.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And so for one minute,
prior to writing,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I get into this zone of like,
woo-hoo, I love my life.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
note I ever wrote.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:90%
This is so much fun.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Because writing for a
writer isn't always fun.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.762 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
there's a blank screen.

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to say?

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.897 align:middle line:90%
How do I say it different?

00:02:54.897 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This just
happened in my life.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:90%
How do I forget that?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Exactly.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So instead of
visualizing, I'm writing,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
which is messing with the
cursed how, I advise whatever

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
it is you want,
life transformation,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
abundance, pain
free living, imagine

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:90%
that it's already happened.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So I imagine that I've already
written this really great note,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of imagining, today,
I'll write about gratitude.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:90%
That's boring.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So this end result then
kind of presses the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:84%
how's, the means,
the inspiration,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to me, that is released and
discovered when I act on it,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%
just like any dream coming true.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
You command the universe,
you command miracles,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
if you will, for abundance,
for a career that you would do,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.866 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is you're
after, by the end result.

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Because with the end result,
the universe instantly

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
knows how, given all of
your other priorities,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and 7 billion co-creators,
the universe is like,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:90%
I know how to do that.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But then you need put yourself
in a place of receivership

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
for that transformation, whether
it's moving towards a partner,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:84%
or abundance, or in this case,
a note from the universe.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So taking action
comes from actually

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
writing the first stuff that
comes to mind, which always

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:90%
sucks, which always is bad.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And in parallel, the baby
steps towards any dream,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%
they always seem futile.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:90%
They always seem pathetic.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
They always seem like, I
dream of champagne and caviar,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and here I'm going to a
job I hate at the mall.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:90%
It's like, go.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Just be reachable.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have to
take these baby steps.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And by baby steps, they're the
first words to come to mind.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you
take action, it

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
breeds clarity in
life and in writing.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you
have a new angle,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
a new thought, let
me delete this,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:84%
let me move this here,
let me cut and paste,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:90%
let me start over.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'm in a place of
like, woohoo, I love that note.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did it.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.377 align:middle line:84%
And then you sign it
from the Universe.

00:04:55.377 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I sign it
from the universe.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And it does work.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It gives me an ability to
say things that mere mortal

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Mike really wouldn't say.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.592 align:middle line:90%
Believe in yourself.

00:05:05.592 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:90%
You're pushed onto greatness.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are 10,000
times-- positive thoughts

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
are 10,000 times more powerful
than your negative thoughts.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.824 align:middle line:90%
If I sign that Mike--

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:16.489 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like, who is Mike?

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: But as the Universe,
you're like, well, yeah,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.738 align:middle line:90%
that resonates with me.

00:05:19.738 --> 00:05:20.246 align:middle line:90%
Woo.

00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever feel like you
channel these, or bring them

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:90%
in from the divine?

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I call it
conscious channeling.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
has much meaning.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
But no, I don't
go into this zone,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:84%
as some channelers, where a
greater, higher self comes

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:84%
through, and then
I wake up, and I'm

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:90%
like, wow, what just happened?

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But consciously,
I'm aware of it.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I wrangle with it.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:90%
I have intuition.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I have these feelings.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And I surprise myself with
what I write sometimes.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is channeling,
but not as most people define

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:90%
channeling.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let me back up a
few steps before you started

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:90%
the Notes From the Universe.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
What were you doing, and what
got you started on this path?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.842 align:middle line:84%
Because it definitely
wasn't always this way.

00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't always Notes
From the Universe.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Well, way
back when out of school,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I was a certified public
accountant for Price Waterhouse

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:90%
for six years.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I wanted more.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be an entrepreneur,
so I sold-- not knowing

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:90%
what I'd do, I quit.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Kind of forced
the circumstances.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Teamed up eventually with
my brother and mother,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and we launched type t-shirts,
Totally Unique T-shirts,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
upon which was my brother's art
and my inspirational writings

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.731 align:middle line:84%
about life, dreams,
and happiness.

00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: PricewaterhouseCooper.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge-- I mean,
nobody leaves that situation

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:90%
without really a reason.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:90%
What was the reason?

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It was unusual,
to say the least.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I got into
PricewaterhouseCoopers,

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
or I got into public
accounting, because I

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:90%
wanted to have a rocking life.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I was drawn to the business
world as a student,

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:90%
as a teenager.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:90%
My uncle was an entrepreneur.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.439 align:middle line:84%
And all of the wise folk,
grown-ups in my life

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.730 align:middle line:84%
said, you know, if you want
business world, if you want

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
to have a rocking
entrepreneurial life,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
get an accounting degree, but
don't get stuck in accounting.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what they all said.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, I though,
all right, I like

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
math, so I got accounting
degree and became

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
a certified public accountant.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But it was to the
ends of me being

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.140 align:middle line:84%
very deliberate and conscious
about shaping my life

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and fortunes.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And after six years, and no one
came along and swept me away

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
off my feet, oh, you're the
guy we need for our company,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I thought, sheesh, I'm
going to be here forever,

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:90%
stuck in accounting.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Which is an awesome profession,
particularly in that realm,

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't me.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't that hard
to see that it wasn't me.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.299 align:middle line:84%
And since no one came
along and rescued me,

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I'm quitting.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to quit, force
the deal, trust life's magic.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And within a few
months, teamed up

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
with Andy, my
brother, and my mother

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and launched a t-shirt company.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Which was slow going.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I thought I made the
biggest mistake of my life.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But within a year, we
were gathering momentum.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Within two, we did a
million dollars annually

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:90%
for the next eight years.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my gosh.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.399 align:middle line:90%
On a t-shirt company?

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Oh, yeah.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:90%
We sold them all over the world.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.549 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Full-on t-shirt company.

00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:20.174 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:08:20.174 --> 00:08:21.946 align:middle line:90%
It was t-shirts, gifts, apparel.

00:08:21.946 --> 00:08:23.570 align:middle line:84%
We branched into
absolutely everything.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I got some of
your greeting cards, which

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:90%
were really beautiful.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Those are great too.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So you took this
company to another level

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and came up with this TUT.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:90%
TUT.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.704 align:middle line:84%
So TUT became, other
than Totally Ultimat--

00:08:37.704 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Totally
Unique T-shirts.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Unique T-shirts to?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.179 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Well, it then evolved
into Totally Unique Thoughts

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:84%
as we broadened spectrum
of what we made available.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But by the eighth from the
year we started, the trends

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:90%
were declining, it wasn't fun.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:90%
We had bought Mom out.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Andy and I were at
each other's throats.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And we thought, you know, if we
liquidate now, even though it

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:84%
would be pennies on the
dollars remaining inventory,

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:90%
we'd still be ahead financially.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we could
individually figure out

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
what we'll do with
the rest of our lives.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And so we did that.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And that brought on
the most harrowing,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:84%
terrifying, unpleasant
time of my life.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:90%
I was almost 40.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I was faced with
starting over, but didn't

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:90%
know what I'd be starting.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I had no tunnel.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No tunnel.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It was
really, really bad.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I wished I could
receive random motivation vis a

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
vis this new thing
called the internet,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because it was new
in the 1990s to me.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.435 align:middle line:84%
And since nobody was sending
it out that I knew of,

00:09:40.435 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I thought you know,
maybe those people who

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:84%
signed our store's guest
books and left their email

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
addresses wouldn't
mind hearing from me

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
on the nature of reality,
the same kind of stuff that

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:90%
was on the t-shirts.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's how you started.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.791 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: That's how I started.

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The list in the '90s.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.379 align:middle line:84%
You really had some
foresight there.

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Well, you
know, like Al Gore, who

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.336 align:middle line:84%
invented the internet, I
thought it would go places.

00:10:05.336 --> 00:10:06.426 align:middle line:90%
I joke.

00:10:06.426 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHING] You did that.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
We'll take a look
here at Mike talking

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.720 align:middle line:90%
about thoughts becoming things.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
-How many of you have
heard the expression,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
be careful of what you wish for,
because you just might get it?

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Hands?

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:90%
You've all heard it.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, how many of you
also believe it's

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:90%
true to at least some degree?

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Be honest.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, then.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
have therefore given

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
considerable time,
energy, or thought

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to figuring out just how
or why it could be true?

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, having
a mother who's

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:84%
always inspired me to
be a big time dreamer,

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:90%
I have thought about it.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to the
conclusion that there is indeed

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
a principle at play in the
universe that turns wishes

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:90%
into reality.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.789 align:middle line:84%
It's the exact same principle
that powers positive thinking.

00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's the very
same principle that

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
explains why visualizing
is an exercise practiced

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
It's even encouraged in our
basic toast masters manual.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
In three simple words,
that principle is this.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.316 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts become things.

00:11:25.316 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
it figuratively.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean it literally.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts become things.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Not sometimes, but all the time.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And not just our positive
thoughts, but the other ones

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it's an
immutable law, as rigid

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and predictable as gravity.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've known about this
principle my entire adult life.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And actually, while I'm
not really all that old,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I've had some
amazing experiences

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:84%
with it, my favorite of which
began just two years after I

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.752 align:middle line:90%
graduated from college.

00:11:57.752 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I was working for
Price Waterhouse,

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and it took me two years
with PW to finally get myself

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
in a position
where I could begin

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
thinking about thriving
in the real world

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:90%
instead of just surviving.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I did
to help me think thoughts

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
about thriving in
the real world was

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:90%
I created a little scrapbook.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the scrapbook,
I put pictures

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I had taken from magazines
of things that I wanted,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:84%
like a nice watch, a fancy
car, a condo, a house.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And I also put in this
scrapbook pictures

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
of foreign destinations that
one day, I'd like to visit.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:90%
London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And I used this
scrapbook to help

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
me visualize every conceivable
detail of my dreamed of life.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, I did this visualizing
experiment every single day

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of weeks, and
nothing seemed to happen.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
After just a couple of
months, every single day,

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:90%
nothing seemed to happen.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was almost
a full year later

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.342 align:middle line:84%
when one day, I went to
work as I always did,

00:13:05.342 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and for the first time,
learned that Price Waterhouse

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:84%
every year sends a few
select people overseas

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.776 align:middle line:90%
on foreign assignments.

00:13:12.776 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Six weeks later , I was
living in sunny Saudi Arabia.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Which to a couple of
you here might not

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:90%
sound like a dream come true.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And I have to admit, I
had not spent any time

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
visualizing myself living
in the Middle East.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Never even heard of Riyadh
six weeks prior to making it

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.495 align:middle line:90%
my home.

00:13:40.495 --> 00:13:43.415 align:middle line:84%
But I had been visualizing
my dreamed of life,

00:13:43.415 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think anything
else could have taken me there

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
quicker at that point in my life
than this 18 month tour of duty

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:90%
to Saudi Arabia.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Because while I was there,
I earned a very considerable

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:84%
hardship bonus, and I
accrued three months

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
paid time off to go wherever
and whenever I wanted.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And during those three months,
I went to every city and country

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:84%
on God's green earth
that I had ever

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
dreamed of going
throughout Africa, Asia,

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:90%
the Far East, the South Seas.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And my heart nearly
missed a beat one morning,

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
having breakfast at the regent
hotel in Kowloon, Hong Kong,

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:84%
when I looked up
from over my coffee

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.690 align:middle line:84%
through the two-story plate
glass wall that surrounded me,

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and saw the exact same
view of Hong Kong Island

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that I had cut and pasted into
my little scrapbook just two

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:90%
years earlier.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I could go on and on
to, sharing with you

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
more fantastic stories,
and some really sad ones,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
all illustrating how my
thoughts had become the things

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and events of my life.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But you know who else
could do that, don't you?

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of
you here, because it

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is an immutable law that
governs all of our lives,

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:90%
whether we know about it or not.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.040 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have a very
unique way of looking

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
at things from a very different
perspective, like the universe,

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
or like dead people.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
You somehow get into
this perspective

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:90%
of these enormous non-entities.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:84%
So this book, "The Top 10 Things
Dead People Want to Tell You,"

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:90%
is brilliant.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Thank you.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's really,
really brilliant.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all the wisdom
that people who've passed over

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
would come back in and say
it's on a channel to book

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:90%
it's not that.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to bring in
such incredible wisdom.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about-- yeah,
it's really beautiful.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: The book, like
the Notes From the Universe,

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:84%
give me a platform to share
what has stirred in me for

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:90%
as long as I can remember.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I've always been almost obsessed
with reality, who we are,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:90%
how we got here.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
As a teenager, a pre-teenager,
I would toss out things

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
to my mom, like time and
space have to be illusionary.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:90%
They can't be real.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:90%
God has to be in all of us.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:84%
There can't be a
hell or a devil.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.040 align:middle line:84%
These ideas don't have
any logic behind them.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And my ambition all my life
was to take these truths that

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:84%
literally stirred in my
veins, and use them to have,

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:90%
selfishly, a rocking life.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But as things turned and
twisted, we just talked about,

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I found myself 15 years
ago like, now what

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:90%
am I going to do?

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And I became, I guess,
this spout of truths.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:90%
I would call them truths.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.203 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the only one that
have stumbled upon them.

00:16:55.203 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Countless others have.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:90%
But they gave me a platform.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
from Notes From Mike

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
to Notes From the Universe,
they became really popular.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I really do feel
like life is knowable.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:90%
There are absolute truths.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:84%
They're not little
fuzzy, gray, everyone

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
has their own truth, boom,
there goes your power.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
With regard to who we
are and how we got here,

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
there is no grey area, and it
doesn't matter what a million

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:90%
people say.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
We are of the eyes and
the ears of the divine.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:90%
We are here by choice.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:90%
We are pushed onto greatness.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Our positive thoughts
are more powerful

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:90%
than negative thoughts.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And these are the things
that just gush out

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:84%
of me all the time,
and that I mull over

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
from every single angle with
the greatest amount of glee.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was a Note From
the Universe that was once

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
titled about three
years ago, just

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
on a whim I had this idea,
after my little woohoo exercise,

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I wrote something that
was like, "And That's

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:90%
What the Dead Want You to Know."

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.969 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, oh,
let's work with this.

00:17:52.969 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:90%
That's fun.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.615 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up
being, Lisa, at these

00:17:56.615 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:84%
are the top 10 things dead
people want to tell you,

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:90%
with a little other fanfare.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I forget how the
note actually went.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And ba doom, ba doom, ba doom,
it became a super popular note,

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
posted on all kinds of
blogs, all over the internet.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It went viral.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.956 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And I
thought, you know?

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:90%
That would be a cool, cool book.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And the 10 things would be
10 chapters of the book.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I sat down with Hay
House for the very first time,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.144 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of lightly talked
about this secret ambition

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to write a book about what the
dead people would tell you.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.018 align:middle line:84%
Because it would
give me a platform

00:18:27.018 --> 00:18:28.934 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
absolute truths of life--

00:18:28.934 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That you have found.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: That I have
found that I truly

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
believe the dead
have died to tell us,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:90%
in a manner of speaking.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a
heightened vantage

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:90%
point, the old souls at least.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:90%
Not the new souls.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
They're still chasing demons,
no doubt, on the other side,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and getting ready
for their next turn.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:84%
But the dead would want us
to know that they're well.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:90%
That everything's OK.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to let go,
to stop the grieving,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to celebrate their life, and
begin enjoying your life.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Because from where
they are, they

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:90%
can see these absolute truths.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
They can see that life
is a banquet, where

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
we get to choose our
thoughts, thoughts

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:90%
that will then become things.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And on and on and on.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The one
about, we're OK, it's

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
we are ready to die,
basically, but you're not.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:90%
That is beautifully said.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.290 align:middle line:84%
No one left behind is
ready for them to go.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
you know that your loved

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:90%
one has been sick or not.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:90%
It's never the right time.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's never the
right time to have a baby.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:84%
You're never prepared for
the amount that it is.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.805 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:19:41.805 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's a
beautiful perspective

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and comforting to those
who've lost loved ones.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
If they were to come back
around and say, we're fine.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It would be the
greatest soothing balm

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
imaginable for all of us
who have lost loved ones.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Because in these
primitive times that we

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
chose to be alive, primitive
spiritually speaking,

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
we are hardwired using our
physical senses virtually alone

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
to interpret reality,
ourselves, our journeys.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And when someone's gone to
the physical senses, I mean,

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:90%
it's beyond devastating.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, gone forever.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Gone to where?

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And it appears,
since we're not clued

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.500 align:middle line:84%
into the mechanics of
all manifestations,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:90%
it often appears random.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.810 align:middle line:84%
It appears accidental, which
brings about feelings of like,

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:84%
if only, and if I
didn't take the train,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%
if I told him I loved
him one more time.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.690 align:middle line:84%
That those opportunities
are lost forever,

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:90%
and none of that's true.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just our
physical senses, which

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.114 align:middle line:84%
are the biggest liars
in the universe,

00:20:46.114 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
although they serve
a valuable service--

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For survival.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: --time and space.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And they make the
adventures possible.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And they grip us
with our passions.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And they fill us
with excitement.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And they give us
a reason to live.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's a point to living in
the lies and misunderstanding.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But when we take it
so far unnecessarily,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:84%
to believe that the
things can happen

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:84%
by chance and without meaning,
and that there's no order,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:84%
it's even more devastating
to lose someone.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So they want you to
know-- and I talk

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:84%
through the various chapters
about understanding accidents,

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and that there is no such thing,
however random they appear,

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.110 align:middle line:84%
up here and understanding
that life is fair,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:84%
no matter how unfair
circumstances will seem to be.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you get these
enter glimpses of reality,

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
you then realize that they
didn't die, that all is well,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that order is being followed,
perfection and love abound,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.459 align:middle line:84%
and that it's still our
turn on stage, which is

00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:90%
what they most want us to know.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're still here,
even with stage four cancer,

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:90%
you're not ready.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:90%
It is not your time.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.046 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, you'd be gone.

00:21:59.046 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
When it's your
time, you're gone.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're gone.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.386 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: You know,
it's just like that.

00:22:02.386 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And that may seem
naive to viewers

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
right now who are only
using their physical senses,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
but there's so much
more that we can

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
tap into using our inner
senses, using simple deduction,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:84%
just connecting
some dots, as I do

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
in the book, that
can give this comfort

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.011 align:middle line:84%
and excite us with the time
that remains in our own lives.

00:22:22.011 --> 00:22:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going
to see them all again,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be together
forever and ever and ever.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But right now, may hay,
they want to tell you.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.900 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've got
every opportunity

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to discover every truth, and
live your grandest, best,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:90%
most joyful life.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they say you
can create your dream.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Dreams do come true.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:42.983 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:22:42.983 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: There is a process,
and it is identifiable.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And we bear witness and truth
to it in our lives all the time.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if we were to
imagine our ancestors,

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
or our past loved
ones saying, go,

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
do it, do that thing
you've been wanting to do,

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.586 align:middle line:84%
they're like
cheerleaders for us.

00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Absolutely.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Our biggest cheerleaders.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:84%
They adore us, and
they want nothing

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
more than a smile on our face.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And they see now what
they missed in life,

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and they realize we don't
have to be so blind or naive.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What a perspective.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Thoughts
become things.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Define what you want in
terms of the end result,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.576 align:middle line:84%
not how you're
going to get there.

00:23:18.576 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Brain's too small to
do all the logistics.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.915 align:middle line:84%
And then in spite
of the futility,

00:23:22.915 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:84%
the seeming futility,
of it, act on it,

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:84%
do something, baby
step every day.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Show up, and prepare
to be astounded.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, even where it comes
to someone who in this lifetime

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:84%
was very sick, very ill,
once they crossed over,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
your perspective is they
come at you with fervor,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
with excitement, with that
cheerleader perspective.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.400 align:middle line:84%
What about-- OK, so there
was it chilling note

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
that you wrote in the book from
a son who committed suicide,

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and the note was to his brother.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And we can't talk about
it without crying,

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:90%
but it's very deep.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:90%
That was very deep.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So where did you
come up with that?

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: After
every chapter, there

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
is a letter from a dearly
departed to someone back

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
home to kind of make
it real, the lessons

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
of that chapter,
which at times had

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.170 align:middle line:90%
to be a little bit esoteric.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And that chapter that
that letter concludes

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:31.140 align:middle line:84%
was, there is no hell
and there is no devil.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And too often, we are
taught the exact opposite,

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and we're further taught
their loved ones who

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:84%
choose to end their life
are met with brimstone,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.322 align:middle line:90%
and condemnation, and judgement.

00:24:46.322 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to achieve a number
of things with that letter.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, to let
them know there is no hell,

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:90%
there is no devil.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:57.110 align:middle line:84%
That was a bunch of malarkey
designed by people with agendas

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to scare the masses
through manipulation.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Correct.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Would a loving God put
anyone under any circumstances

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
into hell for eternity,
or would a loving God

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:84%
so great that He could hang
the stars in the night sky,

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:16.180 align:middle line:84%
create 100 million spectacular
species on this Earth,

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't that God
be wise enough to be

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:90%
able to rehabilitate anyone?

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't that God
be accountable enough

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
to accept responsibility for
all of his or her children's

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:90%
behavior?

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:84%
All of this is easy to kind
of deduce, and eliminate

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:84%
this fictitious notion
of hell and the devil.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:90%
So that was first and foremost.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:84%
But then, life is a classroom
as well as a playground.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And we're here with free will.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted
to illustrate was

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
that those on the other
side with enough altitude,

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, through
experience as

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
opposed to new souls who are
on the other side frantically

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to create revenge, and
rush back into the jungles--

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.250 align:middle line:84%
because no doubt
that would happen.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Those with the
wherewithal to see more

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
clearly realize-- and
they're shown undoubtedly.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't they be?

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.812 align:middle line:90%
God adores us there.

00:26:13.812 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:90%
There are angels.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:84%
There are intermediary
counselors and helpers.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Show them that they
could have handled

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:84%
their funk, their dilemma,
their crises in a different way

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:90%
other suicide.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:90%
And their rehabilitation begins.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.390 align:middle line:90%
But they are welcomed home.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.460 align:middle line:90%
They are loved.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.350 align:middle line:90%
They are adored.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And so that was the point there.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I go to great lengths
throughout the book to say,

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there's no devil,
or hell, and it is super

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.830 align:middle line:90%
awesome on the other side.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
a line of people

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
waiting to get back
into these most

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
awesome, glorious, magnificent
jungles of time and space.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And so my book is
no excuse for anyone

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.730 align:middle line:90%
to end their life prematurely.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And I go to great lengths
to cover that face as well.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And in the letter,
he apologized to his mom

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:84%
for taking his life, and
forgave her for the life

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.140 align:middle line:90%
that she created for him.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:84%
If that were to be
real, I mean, that

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:84%
was such a deep perspective
to look from, Mike.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
You have this
unbelievable ability

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.750 align:middle line:84%
to look from an outer
perspective that

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.640 align:middle line:90%
isn't in this world.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.580 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look here at
Mike talking about the book.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.600 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
-The title for my upcoming
book, "The Top 10 Things

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Dead People Want to Tell
You," came about, actually,

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.990 align:middle line:90%
as a Note From the Universe.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was going through
my normal process

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
to come up with what
the day's note would be.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, I had
this flash in my mind,

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.037 align:middle line:84%
something like dead
people want to tell you,

00:27:45.037 --> 00:27:46.870 align:middle line:84%
or that's what dead
people want to tell you.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Just a fleeting thought.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And it turned into
"The Top 10 Things

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.581 align:middle line:84%
Dead People Most
Want to Tell You."

00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a Note
From the Universe.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were, I think,
not predictable things.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't, believe
in your dreams,

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't, have courage, and
it wasn't anything like that.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of it was common,
like we're not dead.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But not so common,
we were ready.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
No matter who, no matter how,
no matter when, they were ready.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Number three is,
you're not ready.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Number four is, because of what
I teach day in and day out,

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:90%
dreams can come true.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the chapters
go into great detail

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:90%
in each of these topics.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:84%
The idea of dead people having
something to share really

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:43.260 align:middle line:84%
is kind of obvious if you
believe there's an afterlife.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And poll after poll,
throughout the United States

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and the world, has
indicated that most people

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:90%
do believe in an afterlife.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, they just
kind of stopped there,

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
what to expect.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we can know a
lot about what to expect.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.710 align:middle line:84%
The point being, if you
believe in an afterlife,

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:84%
you believe that we survive the
demise of our physical bodies.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's
going to be going on?

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, can you imagine
discovering not only

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that you survived, but
you're alive and well,

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and that love is
everywhere, and that there's

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
this benign, benevolent
intelligence that's

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.690 align:middle line:84%
kind of wrapped itself around
you, that bathes you in love,

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.770 align:middle line:90%
and approval, and acceptance.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you see those
who've gone before you,

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and you realize they never
died, and that they're intact.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they've taken on
the form and the essence that

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:90%
pleases them most.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Their health is restored.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Their vitality is restored.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Their good looks are restored.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.890 align:middle line:90%
They're on new adventures.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.030 align:middle line:90%
They're on new discoveries.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.580 align:middle line:90%
They have new places to go.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.870 align:middle line:84%
They're excitedly telling
you all about this.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is just blown
to pieces in a joyful way.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The possibilities, the
infinite possibilities,

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:90%
are all coming together.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.834 align:middle line:84%
You're starting
to remember things

00:29:55.834 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:84%
that you had forgotten
during your life,

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.520 align:middle line:84%
because we chose to forget
stuff during our lives,

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.020 align:middle line:84%
so that we could kind
of have a reset button.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the amnesia.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you've got memories

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:84%
from other lifetimes, and other
loves, and other passions,

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and other interests,
and this kaleidoscope

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:84%
is being fulfilled, and the
dots are being connected,

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're just like,
woohoo, oh my gosh.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just all so loving.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, you take a look
back over your shoulder,

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's this devastation
in your wake on planet Earth.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.650 align:middle line:84%
There's these broken
hearts, and there's

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.050 align:middle line:84%
this big hole where
your life once was,

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:90%
and all the survivors.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.290 align:middle line:84%
They're just
distraught, and they're

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:43.300 align:middle line:90%
in this horrific state of grief.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.800 align:middle line:90%
What do you think comes next?

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.620 align:middle line:84%
You, more than anything,
want to reach out.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:90%
You want to talk to them.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.265 align:middle line:84%
You want to shout from the
mountain tops, I'm alive.

00:30:53.265 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.800 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.780 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.160 align:middle line:90%
I see clearly now.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to see it too.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It's all going to make sense.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But your time and
space isn't done.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can see from
this elevated prospective

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:90%
what their challenges are.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
What their
trajectories of growth,

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and discovery, and
joy still will be.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, you want to tell
them that it's awesome,

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.590 align:middle line:84%
but you also don't want
to hasten their desire

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.520 align:middle line:90%
to join you, because game on.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They're still going through
this fertile season of growth.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So you're very measured
in what you can share,

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and what you share,
and so you tell

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:84%
them both sides of
the coin, that it's

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:90%
all so glorious and grand.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But believe me, on this
side of the equation,

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.490 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of time and space,

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:84%
there's a line of folks
waiting to get back

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.720 align:middle line:84%
into the jungles
of time and space.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Because from here, we
see how awesome it is.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:90%
We see how perfect it is.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.710 align:middle line:84%
We see that everyone's becoming
more, and falling in love,

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:54.502 align:middle line:84%
and creating this
world of their dreams,

00:31:54.502 --> 00:31:56.210 align:middle line:84%
even though they don't
know their creator

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So you want to tell
them, you're creating

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:84%
right now as you go
on the fly, that you

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:84%
have this divine
sense about you,

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:84%
this divine power, that's
innate in all consciousness,

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:84%
particularly of
the human variety.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And so, hang in there.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Tough it out.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.890 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be together soon.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's these 10 things
that the dead want to tell you.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Because from their perspective,
they now have all the answers.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Not all the answers.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
There's still going
to be questions.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But enough answers to
give all of us blazing,

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:84%
brilliant clarity, to kind of
get our groove on, and have

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:38.190 align:middle line:84%
a roaring time in space while
the getting's still good.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the nucleus,
or the purpose,

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that evolved as I began
elaborating on what was once

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:84%
a Note From the Universe, just
a page long, that's now 200-page

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:51.130 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:51.580 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.538 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I didn't prepare
you for this question,

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:84%
but if you were Robin Williams,
and you were to write a note

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:84%
back to us, who really, really
miss that man and thought

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.490 align:middle line:84%
so much talent, and he
could've-- we all have our own

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:90%
perspectives.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.550 align:middle line:84%
He could have gotten help,
but we miss him, his talent

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:90%
and his person.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.030 align:middle line:90%
What would he said?

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: There's virtually
no doubt in my mind

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.320 align:middle line:84%
that he would echo all of
the things in the book.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you would see he could
have made other choices--

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not passing judgment
in any way, shape, or form.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine what he went
through, the torment, the hell,

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:37.020 align:middle line:90%
the man-made hell, so to speak.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But he would want
everyone to know he's OK.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.780 align:middle line:84%
He would want everyone to know
that it was not a good choice,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:90%
because others emulate him.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Others model him.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Others are going through
their own misery right now.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And if Robin Williams
can do it, it's

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.350 align:middle line:90%
maybe a respectable choice.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And he wouldn't want anyone
to follow in his footsteps.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:84%
He would remind all of
us that the greatness

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that we admire in him is alive
in each and every one of us.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:84%
That he is no more
divine or gifted

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:15.969 align:middle line:90%
than any single human being.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And that if we so choose,
the best of our lives

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.940 align:middle line:90%
remains in front of all of us.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And so, weather the storm.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Hang in there.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.909 align:middle line:84%
You're going to die
anyway, you might say.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:31.929 align:middle line:84%
And create a chuckle or smile,
because life is fleeting.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I say that to those--
I hear from a lot of people

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:35.909 align:middle line:90%
who are suicidal.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you're
going to die anyway.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And in your mind at least,
it's forever and ever.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have another 10,
or 20, or 80 years on Earth,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:84%
it's nothing compared
to where you're going.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:90%
What's the hurry?

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:84%
For the fact that you're
here, it's meaningful.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.219 align:middle line:90%
It's profoundly meaningful.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Life is not random chance.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
We are not space dust
that collided and evolved

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:90%
into walking upright.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.530 align:middle line:84%
That is patently, ridiculously,
offensively absurd.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And anyone can drill
down to the truths

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that I've drilled
down to in this book,

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.092 align:middle line:90%
because they're so benign.

00:35:08.092 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
create a religion here.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying life is beautiful.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.600 align:middle line:90%
We are powerful.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Eternal sparks of God.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's make hay.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:17.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the truths that
I'm claiming in the book,

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not the first to
have made these declarations.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he is now our
greatest cheerleader.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And he is helping
where one could

help in any way he can
help to those on earth

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.430 align:middle line:84%
while calculating
his next adventures,

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and his next challenges.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Because challenges
are how we grow.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So have you had people
read the book who

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:84%
have contemplated suicide,
and turned their lives

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.649 align:middle line:90%
around form--

00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: I'd like to think so.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.981 align:middle line:84%
It's only been out six
months, so I haven't heard

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.510 align:middle line:90%
somebody say that on this book.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.640 align:middle line:84%
But I heard them say
that just yesterday

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.480 align:middle line:84%
here at this Hay
House conference where

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking, that
there was transformation,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that there was a rethinking,
that I saved them.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I hear that-- many authors
hear that many, many times.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And I remind them that it
wasn't me, that it was them.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And that it wasn't an accident
that they found my book,

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:84%
or Wayne's book,
or your program.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When the student
ready, the teacher appears.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Exactly.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:84%
We're all kind of healers,
every single person.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of healers, you
write beautifully about pets.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And why is it that
when the pet goes,

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:30.260 align:middle line:84%
it reignites the
greatest, deepest loss.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.080 align:middle line:90%
what is that?

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: It's the love
that's in all of us.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:90%
We are love beings.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It's all about love,
as chapter 10 says.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And truth is the
path through love.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's where we have
misunderstandings that we slip,

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:84%
we fall, and we suffer to
profound degrees, agonies,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:90%
through misunderstanding.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And this applies to the love
we feel for our animals.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I can share, and
anyone can realize these truth

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:84%
through themselves,
we are still,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I am still, hardwired
to the illusions.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had to put several
beloved dogs to sleep.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
was the worst one.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I was devastated,
about six years ago.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was shocked
at my reaction,

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:84%
knowing what I feel like I know
about reality, to have been so

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.810 align:middle line:90%
affected by the loss of my dog.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But any pain we feel regarding
anything, anything in life,

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.030 align:middle line:84%
is like a big red flag
that we're missing

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.850 align:middle line:90%
in understanding something.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And the pain, and in
this case the loss,

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.830 align:middle line:84%
whether it is a pet, or
a person, or a habit,

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.930 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, is a big red
flag that, hey, you're

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:84%
really doing great, but
there's this little thing here

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:53.650 align:middle line:90%
you're misunderstanding.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Because the pet's alive.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:90%
The pet's well.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Alive within the palm
of God, so to speak.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.290 align:middle line:90%
You'll meet again.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Everything's eternal.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Everything is ongoing.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And because you're
not seeing that,

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:84%
because you're so
hardwired to the illusions,

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.320 align:middle line:84%
in spite of your
theoretical wisdom,

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:84%
until you get further
on board with the truth,

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.330 align:middle line:84%
it's going to hurt
like the Dickens.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's the greatest gift.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it's through pain,
it's through suffering,

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.150 align:middle line:84%
that we can realize,
hey, I can take my life

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.750 align:middle line:84%
to another orbit with
greater and greater and more

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:25.340 align:middle line:90%
profound truths.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Our beloved cat
of 15 years went away.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
whatever happened,

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.170 align:middle line:90%
but she never came back.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were-- right
before school one day.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.500 align:middle line:84%
We were really sad,
my daughter and I.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And we were just
very sad about her.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:84%
My daughter reaches
in her backpack.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, what
is this furry thing?

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.620 align:middle line:90%
And it was our cat's collar.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way the collar
could have gotten in there.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.280 align:middle line:84%
It's her backpack she brings
to school every single day.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's just all
of our kitty's fur.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Just that moment, we broke down
by the sink, and we just said,

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.130 align:middle line:90%
we see you.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.395 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Zen.

00:39:09.395 --> 00:39:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And we were like,
we see you Zen.

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:90%
You're here.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.110 align:middle line:90%
She's such a healer too.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And animals have that ability,
to just-- anytime anyone

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:84%
was sick, she would just sit
on you and absorb the fever,

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the emotion.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.990 align:middle line:84%
She would sit on the area
of your body that hurt,

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.721 align:middle line:90%
and she would just absorb.

00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And she's just such
an awesome cat.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:90%
And so we miss her.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you say they're
here, I believe you.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Because she manifested this
collar into my daughter's

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.707 align:middle line:90%
backpack.

00:39:37.707 --> 00:39:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Wow.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I do believe you
that you can connect back

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.910 align:middle line:90%
I want to believe you.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:43.670 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I think the
truth being so benign,

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.480 align:middle line:84%
being so simple, being
so absolute, when

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
we brush shoulders with it,
when we hear about it, when

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.930 align:middle line:84%
we read in a book, or watch it
on the TV, or see it in a show,

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:57.110 align:middle line:90%
we resonate.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:58.854 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, we'll argue.

00:39:58.854 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we'll say,
well, where's the proof?

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.644 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we'll say,
well, who else said so?

00:40:02.644 --> 00:40:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we'll say,
what's your authority?

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Don't be so critical, I
would advise most readers,

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
listeners, watchers.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.580 align:middle line:84%
If it feels right, and
you have the wherewithal

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.780 align:middle line:84%
to connect a few logical
dots, like why wouldn't it

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.800 align:middle line:90%
be true that we could connect?

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they're not
gone, they're not gone.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.830 align:middle line:84%
If there's no death,
there's no death.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:90%
And so of course, it's real.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.879 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
they're still there.

00:40:28.879 --> 00:40:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And they have other
adventures, but they're

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:34.300 align:middle line:84%
loving us through our low
points and the times of need.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's quite a story.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:40:36.125 --> 00:40:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It was definitely a miracle.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look here
another video that talks about

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.670 align:middle line:84%
how your words create

-Where do you think your
good ideas come from?

00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they just
rain out of the sky,

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you're lucky,
and sometimes you're not?

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.640 align:middle line:84%
You've never had one
that you didn't summon

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.130 align:middle line:84%
with a vision, a
dream, a thought that

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:84%
could not become a thing without
you having that bright idea.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You draw from the ether
people, players, circumstances,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:84%
courage, creativity,
inspiration, willpower.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you need for that
end result to become a thing,

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.390 align:middle line:84%
it's delivered to you,
infused into your bones,

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.570 align:middle line:84%
as you are physically
showing up.

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:84%

became rich and famous.

is hard, and people are mean.

Listen to the ones who say
they have no free time.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.469 align:middle line:84%
These are their
end results, and it

00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:43.010 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter that they didn't
know that they were their end

I totally get it.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm all over it.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.850 align:middle line:90%
I know attitude is everything.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I've always known
attitude is everything.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I love my life.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:19.520 align:middle line:90%
I love my wife.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I've got great kids.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.670 align:middle line:90%
I even love my work.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But Mike, I just can't
crack the money nut.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:27.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what gives.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Everything I try,
it doesn't work.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.650 align:middle line:84%
No one in the history
of planet Earth

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:37.150 align:middle line:84%
has ever cracked the
money nut who first said,

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't crack the money nut.

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Your words are your wand, as
Florence Scovel Shinn once

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Your words are your end results,
and the universe just marches.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.080 align:middle line:90%
That's how powerful you are.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.690 align:middle line:84%
The great news, on a
dime, you can change

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:55.360 align:middle line:90%
the direction of your ship.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:55.930 align:middle line:90%
On a dime.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the story of
the prodigal child.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you, heads up, I'm

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.690 align:middle line:84%
a big time cherry picker
when it comes to the Bible.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.360 align:middle line:90%
If I like it, I buy it.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And if I don't, I reject it.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:84%
If I read the Koran,
it would be the same.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely do this
with Hallmark greeting cards.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.010 align:middle line:84%
If I find anything
that has truth,

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that reveals life's beauty,
that tells me of my power, that

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:20.470 align:middle line:84%
leaves no one behind, I buy it,
and I'd encourage all of you

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.970 align:middle line:90%
to buy it.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.920 align:middle line:84%
You need no credentials
or further educations

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.680 align:middle line:90%
to sense what is the truth.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And the story of the prodigal
child is one of those gems.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know, it's the
story of the wayward son who

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.930 align:middle line:84%
leaves his family and his
wealthy, wealthy, wealthy

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.250 align:middle line:84%
father behind, and says,
I'm going to go out, Dad,

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:90%
and do this on my own.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:84%
He goes out and makes a
huge mess of everything.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And he musters up the
courage to come back home

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:56.540 align:middle line:90%
and say, Dad, I messed up.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Can I come home?

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And in that instant,
his entire inheritance

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:08.300 align:middle line:84%
is restored, much to the chagrin
of his dutiful brother who

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:90%
stayed home all along.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And in the instant, you
ask the hard questions

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.970 align:middle line:84%
revealing the mechanics
of manifestation,

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that reveal that you pure,
total, God Almighty come

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.770 align:middle line:90%
alive in the dream of life.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Your entire inheritance,
more than you can ever

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.090 align:middle line:84%
spend this lifetime or in
ten thousand lifetimes,

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.400 align:middle line:90%
is restored.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what that story is about.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.584 align:middle line:90%
Waking up to the truth.

00:44:34.584 --> 00:44:36.250 align:middle line:84%
With the truth, you're
set free, and you

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.480 align:middle line:84%
can begin living deliberately
on this pathway to happiness.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.292 align:middle line:84%
And it can all start by
choosing words to serve you.

00:44:43.292 --> 00:44:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Just like the person who
says they can't lose weight,

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.460 align:middle line:90%
you can say whatever you want.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But choose words that
reflect the dream you

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.719 align:middle line:90%
you've always known was inside.

00:44:51.719 --> 00:44:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Living the life
you've always dreamed

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.920 align:middle line:84%
you'd one day live as if
you were already living it.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Say things like, I love,
love, love my life.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.500 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love the
themes in all of what

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:04.570 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about here.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the same
thing in different packages.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.347 align:middle line:84%
But people, to get
this simple concept

00:45:11.347 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:84%
of what you just talked
about in that video,

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.780 align:middle line:84%
that your words can
change your end results--

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.970 align:middle line:84%
so most people say, I'm fat,
or I don't have any money,

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:84%
or I can't afford
that, so that's the end

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:84%
result that people create,
right, from saying whatever

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.410 align:middle line:90%
it is they've said?

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Well, yeah.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Our end results are up to us.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can choose
deliberately what they are,

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.570 align:middle line:84%
or we can tune in to pay
attention to what we're saying.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we hear ourselves
make these declarations,

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:43.360 align:middle line:84%
life is hard, people are
mean, it's all a test,

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:84%
we're being judged, I
don't have enough money,

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't lose weight, we're
revealing to ourselves what

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.320 align:middle line:90%
our present end results are.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Universe is like,
roger, gotcha, we're on it.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You'll be in the wrong place,
at the wrong time, predisposed

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.449 align:middle line:84%
to the wrong food, with no
willpower, slow metabolism,

00:45:58.449 --> 00:46:00.634 align:middle line:90%
gotcha.

00:46:00.634 --> 00:46:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we don't like what
we catch ourselves saying,

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.590 align:middle line:84%
we can deliberately
spark change.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:08.570 align:middle line:90%
This won't be enough.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But you can spark change
by making a declaration,

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:13.640 align:middle line:84%
speaking of your life
as if it was already

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.640 align:middle line:90%
the life of your dreams.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of yourself
as if you were already

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.180 align:middle line:90%
the person of your dreams.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, you remember
step two, take action,

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.700 align:middle line:90%
show up, baby steps.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Act as if you are
that person that

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.950 align:middle line:90%
was the ideal way, that had--

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Perfect metabolisms.

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Or metabolism,
or career of your dreams.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Speak your end results.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Visualize your end results.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.390 align:middle line:84%
You're always choosing
your end results.

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And pay attention to
how you're behaving,

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.490 align:middle line:90%
and hear what you're saying.

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what happens
when there's accidents,

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.800 align:middle line:84%
or where there's
devastation, or things

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.200 align:middle line:90%
happen that are uncontrollable?

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.450 align:middle line:84%
What's the self-talk
at that point?

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Well, there
are no accidents.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Seeming accidents, so-called
accidents, crop up in our life

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.410 align:middle line:84%
because they are a stepping
stone to a further place

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that we did talk about,
that we did believe in,

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.270 align:middle line:90%
that was our end result.

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Meaning?

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: Well, let me just
give you a hypothetical.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:11.550 align:middle line:90%
I live in Orlando.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:12.970 align:middle line:90%
And I want to go to Miami.

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.554 align:middle line:84%
Miami's my end
result. Along the way,

00:47:15.554 --> 00:47:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who I'm
going to see on the road.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.845 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where I'm going
to stop for gas or for rest.

00:47:19.845 --> 00:47:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But all of these
unthought of experiences

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.140 align:middle line:84%
are necessary for
the journey to get me

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.640 align:middle line:84%
to where I was thinking
about, Orlando.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people in life
have end results that are,

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.640 align:middle line:84%
as we just said, life is
hard, people are mean,

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.760 align:middle line:84%
it's all a test,
God decides-- all

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.220 align:middle line:84%
of these things that
aren't true as reality,

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.320 align:middle line:84%
as features of reality,
but they become

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.340 align:middle line:84%
true for the person
claiming them.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So life is hard,
people are mean,

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:51.470 align:middle line:84%
as you go through
your business, you're

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:53.680 align:middle line:84%
going to find that
life is very hard,

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to draw
into your realm mean people.

00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Or you might think life is
great, the universe loves me,

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:06.320 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not good with math, and
money has always been elusive.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got
contradictory end results,

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and so you're setting yourself
up for a kind of a quagmire,

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.260 align:middle line:84%
where there will
be the unexpected.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But as we said about
paint a moment ago,

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.430 align:middle line:90%
this is a great red flag.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:84%
This is like, hey, there's
a chink in your armor

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't
even know you had.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But now there's been this slip,
this accident, this whatever,

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that's telling you you can and
should ask for more clarity.

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:34.410 align:middle line:84%
You should reexamine
your thoughts.

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Pay more attention
to your words,

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.880 align:middle line:90%
and get to a place of clarity.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to add also to
that, because a lot of people

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.410 align:middle line:84%
will ask in my live
audiences, what

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:47.390 align:middle line:84%
do you do when
everything's going well,

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling great
about life, and then wham,

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:90%
you're blindsided by bad stuff?

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And with a proper understanding
of the nature of reality,

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:59.490 align:middle line:84%
including our choices
that brought us here,

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.030 align:middle line:84%
including that we all
survive, we all rock and roll,

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.410 align:middle line:84%
everyone beats cancer,
maybe not this lifetime,

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:08.820 align:middle line:84%
but beyond in that light,
then all of a sudden,

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:11.760 align:middle line:84%
from those perhaps
heightened perspectives,

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.220 align:middle line:84%
you realize there
is no bad stuff.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:18.220 align:middle line:84%
There is no junk, gunk, or crap
that lands in anyone's life.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It's all like a stepping stone
to higher, greater, better

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.950 align:middle line:90%
than you even knew existed.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:27.930 align:middle line:84%
That was otherwise unreachable
to you with your prior mindset.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So you know whether it's
cancer, or a car accident,

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:35.320 align:middle line:84%
or a divorce, or whatever,
these are invitations

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.860 align:middle line:84%
for you to go to a higher
orbit than you even knew

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.220 align:middle line:90%
existed before.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And so long as you're not
kicking, and screaming,

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and cursing, and resisting the
whole way, which just sets up

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.820 align:middle line:84%
a war, you're just resisting
the entire universe,

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:90%
which is futile--

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.365 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which is a lot of work.

00:49:52.365 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: It's awful.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can open yourself
up to higher thinking,

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:58.070 align:middle line:90%
to greater truths.

00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Which doesn't mean
capitulate to cancer,

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:02.860 align:middle line:84%
or just say make
the best of the fact

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that your maimed from
the car accident.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, you're
not going to accept that.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.990 align:middle line:84%
But you will accept
what happened,

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:14.410 align:middle line:84%
so that you can therefore
plant new seeds,

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:18.740 align:middle line:84%
have a heightened perspective,
and live grander than ever

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:19.817 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:50:19.817 --> 00:50:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So do you do that?

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Do you set up what your next
step is through your words?

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you practice all of this?

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I do the only
seemingly on the face

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:34.340 align:middle line:84%
spiritual thing I do is every
morning before I go to work,

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I visualize with the timer
in my office, my home office,

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:40.680 align:middle line:90%
for about 4 and 1/2 minutes.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.660 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The only deviation
from normal life.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Normal life, I would argue,
is very spiritual for me.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do see
the good in people.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I do look for God in their eyes.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.840 align:middle line:90%
I do try to take the high road.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind, benevolent.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think I am
in all those regards.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always aiming
for greater, bigger,

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:08.880 align:middle line:84%
in my own personal,
private, rocking life,

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and in reaching more
people with messages

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that it resonate with
greater and greater numbers.

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So where do
you go from here?

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I tell my audiences
in my crises 15 years ago,

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I came up with four general end
results, wealth and abundance,

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.930 align:middle line:84%
creative fulfilling work,
friends and laughter,

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:28.490 align:middle line:90%
international travel.

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And those will be my
guiding lights forever more.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:35.717 align:middle line:84%
I don't need anything
more specific than that.

00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm going to write a book.

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:38.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Then you're messing
with the cursed house.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.160 align:middle line:84%
You're carrying the weight of
the world on your shoulders.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, I will write more books.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:44.740 align:middle line:90%
I will give more talks.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And I will knock on
more doors forever more.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But there may be a vehicle
of expression or a way

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:53.923 align:middle line:84%
for me teach that's not
even on the radar right now.

00:51:53.923 --> 00:51:54.422 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:54.422 --> 00:51:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And I would slam shut
the door on such possibilities

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.090 align:middle line:84%
if I insisted on, I'm going
to write, I'm going to speak.

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
knock on all doors,

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and see what happens, while
commanding the universe

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.430 align:middle line:84%
with my overall big
picture end results

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.550 align:middle line:84%
of a rocking, happy,
joyful life, which

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:16.470 align:middle line:84%
leaves room for
great relationships,

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.910 align:middle line:90%
and my new young family.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Infinite possibilities.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.902 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have a baby.

00:52:21.902 --> 00:52:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I have a one year,
one-month-old baby girl.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:25.665 align:middle line:90%
I'm a first time dad.

00:52:25.665 --> 00:52:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Awesome.

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:29.410 align:middle line:84%
It's so exciting, because
all that you've taught,

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and all that you teach,
you get to now impart

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.700 align:middle line:90%
upon this little one.

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.492 align:middle line:84%
However, the mundane
does still occur.

00:52:36.492 --> 00:52:37.450 align:middle line:90%
You still have diapers.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:39.389 align:middle line:90%
And you still-- [LAUGHING]

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And that's
not so mundane, is it?

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:45.410 align:middle line:84%
No, I think every moment,
it's all a miracle.

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.260 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to do stuff.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.110 align:middle line:90%
We get to do.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:50.490 align:middle line:84%
That I get to change
one more pair of diapers

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:53.055 align:middle line:90%
is like, what a crazy gift.

00:52:53.055 --> 00:52:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
to ask for the joy

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.970 align:middle line:90%
that this girl has given me.

00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aw.

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:01.099 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: And it's part
of my amazing life.

00:53:01.099 --> 00:53:02.265 align:middle line:90%
And I want her to diversify.

00:53:02.265 --> 00:53:03.930 align:middle line:90%
I want her to enjoy life.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:07.695 align:middle line:84%
I want her to smell the
roses and see the miraculous

00:53:07.695 --> 00:53:08.780 align:middle line:90%
in the mundane.

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.887 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:53:09.887 --> 00:53:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I love what you
said here, because what

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I got from this was, you don't
need to set big, huge goals.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:20.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to go after that
next million dollar pay raise.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.550 align:middle line:84%
You are happy with creating the
life that you have every day.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You're in that great
space of creating

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.780 align:middle line:90%
every day what you love to do.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They're not these super peaks
in your life I'm seeing.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:36.530 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the slow
rise of greatness.

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel that way?

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't have these
super high dramas?

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:39.605 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Yeah.

00:53:39.605 --> 00:53:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Totally My number one lesson
in my full day workshop,

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:45.640 align:middle line:84%
my trademark material, is
the ultimate end result

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.660 align:middle line:90%
is always happiness.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.557 align:middle line:84%
And while that may
lack some luster--

00:53:50.557 --> 00:53:51.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is happiness?

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to define
it for themselves.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say, go ahead
and have some priorities.

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, for me, they were those
four objectives-- abundance,

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.420 align:middle line:90%
travel, friends, and laughter.

00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.090 align:middle line:90%
So those are my priorities.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's no, this book,
that contract, that deal,

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:07.200 align:middle line:90%
this person.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Then, you carry the weight of
the world on your shoulders.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So I have gigantic
dreams of happiness

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:16.590 align:middle line:84%
that I color in with
details, but those details I

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:18.160 align:middle line:90%
don't attach to.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.030 align:middle line:84%
That leaves room for
infinite possibilities.

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's where the
insights come for the Notes

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.640 align:middle line:90%
From the Universe.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you're writing
life in a wave,

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.281 align:middle line:84%
but I don't see these super
high peaks and valleys.

00:54:30.281 --> 00:54:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if you set yourself up
for that, and you don't get--

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: That hurts.

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:34.113 align:middle line:90%
And then what?

00:54:34.113 --> 00:54:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And then, you have to up it?

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.680 align:middle line:84%
As you go down these paths that
we're talking about, knocking

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.260 align:middle line:84%
on doors, even if
at first, it's kind

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.700 align:middle line:84%
of a sucky path
to a job you hate,

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.760 align:middle line:84%
when you understand the
truth about reality,

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.840 align:middle line:84%
you become a lightning
rod for serendipity.

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.840 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you're
on the yellow brick road

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.340 align:middle line:90%
a couple of years later.

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.594 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
happiness is your gig.

00:54:54.594 --> 00:54:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And you're coloring it here,
and you're coloring it there.

00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're tweaking
the machinery.

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And you've built a foundation,
which is all important.

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, your
success is precarious.

00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you feel like
it could be taken away.

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:08.530 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
you feel vulnerable.

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But this steadier
approach, with happiness

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.157 align:middle line:84%
as your light, priorities in
other areas, is the formula,

00:55:17.157 --> 00:55:17.740 align:middle line:90%
is the ticket.

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even though
you have things

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.658 align:middle line:84%
like kids going off
to college, or having

00:55:20.658 --> 00:55:23.300 align:middle line:84%
to start a new job, or this one
implodes, and that one starts,

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.007 align:middle line:84%
you just ride it
like it's the wave.

00:55:25.007 --> 00:55:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Setting your intentions
along the way,

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.090 align:middle line:84%
making sure that your
language is in coherence

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:31.300 align:middle line:84%
with who you're being
around it, and you just

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:32.379 align:middle line:90%
create life that way.

00:55:32.379 --> 00:55:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: As a Note
From the Universe

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.680 align:middle line:84%
once said, whether it's for
other people or yourself,

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.240 align:middle line:90%
always wish for the best.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.780 align:middle line:90%
You can leave it that.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever
happens, know that it was.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, you don't
start labeling things.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.590 align:middle line:90%
That was bad.

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:46.860 align:middle line:90%
I must be flawed.

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I have an invisible,
limiting self-sabotage.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all playing to
your greater good.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.010 align:middle line:90%
See it as good.

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Look for the gift.

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And even if you don't know what
the gift was, it was imparted.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
figure out how you

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:02.240 align:middle line:84%
got where you are,
particularly if it's painful,

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.260 align:middle line:84%
to otherwise figure out
how to move from it.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.236 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of my lesson.

00:56:06.236 --> 00:56:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Beautiful.

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:09.307 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
giving us your wisdom.

00:56:09.307 --> 00:56:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DOOLEY: Thank you, Lisa.

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And for hanging
out with me for the hour.

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:12.761 align:middle line:90%
It's been wonderful.

00:56:12.761 --> 00:56:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOOLEY: I've
enjoyed every minute.

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:15.362 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:15.362 --> 00:56:17.820 align:middle line:84%
