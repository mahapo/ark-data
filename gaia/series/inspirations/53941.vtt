[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.220 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations,"

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.510 align:middle line:10%
and we are broadcasting
here from beautiful Denver,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.650 align:middle line:10%
Colorado.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.720 align:middle line:10%
So did you know that you can
literally talk your way out

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:10%
of stress?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:84%
That you can actually
heal through communication

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:84%
instead of medication
in many cases?

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Neha Sangwan is with me.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Her goal is to create
self-care through health care.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:84%
She's known as a doctor
of communications,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
but she's also a doctor
of internal medicine

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and a physician whose main
prescription is communication.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.274 align:middle line:90%
It is, isn't it?

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NEHA SANGWAN: It is.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:84%
At least it's the front
line prescription.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Which is, I look there before
I prescribe someone medication,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
whereas I think our
medical system goes

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.637 align:middle line:90%
the opposite direction.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.947 align:middle line:84%
So how did you, as a physician
of internal medicine,

00:00:57.947 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
where people are coming
to you with ailments

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.575 align:middle line:84%
and usually
intestinally related,

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
how did you relink that
to their communication?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So really, of course,
right, doctor heal thyself.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:90%
It was me and my patients.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:10%
But initially I think
people's signals

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:10%
come to them as whispers.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:10%
So they just hear a little
something, you know?

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.564 align:middle line:90%
Mine was throat constriction.

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:10%
So my throat would
just constrict,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.374 align:middle line:10%
and then after a while
I couldn't breathe.

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:10%
And it almost felt
like a constant sense

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:10%
of gasping for air.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:10%
And then I went to a doctor
convinced that this throat

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:10%
constriction was a tumor, right?

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd been reading about
it, learning about it, right?

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Seeing all these
people who had it.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And they put me out
under anesthesia,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
put a camera down my throat,
and said no, you look great.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're on your way.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Two years later I had
convinced another doctor

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to do the same thing who then
said to me, you look great.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I think it's stress.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, stress?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Are you crazy?

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just went along my
way until I burned out.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I burned out in 2004,
it became very clear to me

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I was in the wrong job, I was
in the wrong relationship.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.197 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't a good fit.

00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where do you
think it started?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.849 align:middle line:90%
Take me back to childhood.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So I think
it started quite young.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
I would say I had a very
colorful, creative, loud older

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:90%
sister.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And all I wanted was
her affection and love.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason, she
wasn't very interested in me.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little bit of like a gnat,
an annoying pest, an 18 month

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
younger sister who just wants
to do everything you want to do.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
was when I started

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:84%
to learn that my voice
wasn't important.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started to learn
from the Indian community

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:90%
that I grew up in.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:90%
My family's amazing.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.945 align:middle line:84%
And they come with
cultural beliefs.

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's about science,
it's about education,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:90%
it's about achievement.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It's about, this is
the right way to do it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.483 align:middle line:84%
and you're married by this age
and you have this many children

00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
by this-- like,
they had beliefs.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I found myself
listening to those,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:90%
it was like a battle to belong.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.522 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you feel
internally and intuitively

00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't right?

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: I don't know
that I ever at that age

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:90%
could hear my own voice.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Because ever since
I was little, I

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
was looking to them to take
care of me and love me.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.602 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned very
quickly how to please others.

00:03:30.602 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
All I wanted was their
love and approval.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.232 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Don't we all?

00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.481 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And so I think
from a very young age

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
we learn as children what makes
people laugh, what has them

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
give us a hug,
what gives us love.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And so
I think what we're

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
doing is we're listening
to their voices

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and by the time we get
older, in high school,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:84%
we're listening to our peers'
voices louder than our own.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.654 align:middle line:90%
Anything to fit in, right?

00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Fiercely.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of
survival sometimes.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: It is a
matter of survival.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: If I don't fit in here,
then I'm going be ostracized

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:84%
and not liked, and it's
going to go back to all that.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you had
that experience as a child,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
but when you got to medicine,
you followed the routine

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.907 align:middle line:84%
and you went to medical
school and you did what you--

00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: I was a good soldier.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A good girl.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: I was so good that my
dad wanted me to be an engineer

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
and my mom wanted
me to be a doctor.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I figured
out they weren't mutually

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.472 align:middle line:90%
exclusive, I did both of them.

00:04:26.472 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, of course I'll
please the world here.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, I mean, I had a
love and an ease with math

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and science and all of
that, and I loved people.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So it just seemed
like the right fit.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But then when I
got in, I started

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.080 align:middle line:90%
listening to my patients.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And they would say things
to me like, you know doc,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.457 align:middle line:84%
thanks so-- I worked
in the hospital.

00:04:47.457 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So it would be heart
attacks, strokes, pneumonias,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:84%
the things that really
get people intubated.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when they'd
come out and we'd

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:84%
have them medically stabilized
they would say things like,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
doc, thank you for helping
me with this heart attack,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
but please don't discharge
me, because I can't go back

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
to that toxic relationship
and environment.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.196 align:middle line:90%
That's what's killing me.

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You heard it again.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.653 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: And I heard it again.

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd see them again
six months, a year later.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.652 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:05:12.652 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And I
thought to myself,

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:90%
am I really helping them?

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Of course I'm helping them
through an acute crisis.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:90%
But am I really helping them?

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, am I helping them
solve the underlying issues

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have
to be here again?

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you realized that
you weren't in that level.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So how did you bridge the gap
to being able to actually--

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.455 align:middle line:84%
because you're an internal
medicine doctor, not

00:05:36.455 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
a therapist, a psychologist,
and all of that.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:90%
But yet they are very linked.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:84%
How linked is the
gut to not speaking?

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So there
are so many nerves.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
A majority of your nerves,
like, major amounts in your skin

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and in your GI
tract, or your gut.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times the
way stress shows up

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.251 align:middle line:84%
is-- have you ever heard that,
a little kid, all the way

00:05:59.251 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:90%
from when you're little.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Mom, I have a tummy ache.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.747 align:middle line:90%
I can't go to school.

00:06:02.747 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And the parent
will be like, oh, you just

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
don't want to go to school.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.673 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: No.

00:06:07.673 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
It's because the child
is experiencing something

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that they're resisting
or upset about,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and their stomach is turning,
they're getting these signals.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The only way they know how to
describe it is my tummy hurts.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not a doctor tummy ache.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a sit down and can we
talk about this tummy ache?

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it
starts very young.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:84%
When you're in college, I saw it
play out as hives before exams.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard of people--

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.688 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right?

00:06:32.688 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Breaking out in hives
for finals week.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
As we get older, I've
noticed that some

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
of the most common ways that
it shows up in my clients

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
are acid reflux,
diarrhea, constipation.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Some semblance of just, like,
not feeling OK in your gut.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
acid reflux for a second,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:84%
because there's millions
and millions of people

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that take acid
reflux medications.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's masking the symptom
of the actual issue that

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.010 align:middle line:90%
might be going on.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Is there a percentage
of people that you

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
would say that
truly have the acid,

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.790 align:middle line:84%
or is it really, truly
related to the emotion?

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So it's
an and, right?

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that there
are physical reasons depending

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:84%
on what you ate last
night or drank last night.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Functional medicine
is a kind of medicine

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that really looks into
gluten, dairy, you know,

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
how do all these things
impact your system?

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So there can definitely
be physical causes,

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.549 align:middle line:84%
what you're putting
in your body.

00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
There's also mechanical
causes, which

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:84%
would be, like, your valve at
the bottom of your esophagus

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:90%
is loose, right?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:90%
That's going to let up acid.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
There also can be
anxiety and stress

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that causes people to have
their body be over stimulated

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and be ready to run, that
causes that adrenaline response.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.249 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
the percentage.

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:03.081 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able to
give you a percentage.

00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
But what I can tell
you is it usually

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
is a combination of
all of these things.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as someone-- we
don't know what comes first--

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.315 align:middle line:84%
but as soon as they
start feeling that acid,

00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:14.190 align:middle line:84%
either they start getting
nervous and worried

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
and catastrophizing.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:90%
It all works together.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Now were they nervous,
worried, and catastrophizing,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:90%
and then they got it?

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm not usually sure.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But I know that it
all works together.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.803 align:middle line:84%
And so do see a certain
amount of children?

00:08:26.803 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Mm hmm.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.145 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And when
you see children

00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that have
gastrointestinal issues,

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.054 align:middle line:84%
do you talk to the parents about
the emotional issues behind it?

00:08:36.054 --> 00:08:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Absolutely.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have to, right?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.725 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: But more than
talking to them, what I do

00:08:39.725 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
is I have them watch a session
of me working with their child.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the child will
just be talking to me

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have them
coloring, and we'll get up

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.331 align:middle line:84%
and we'll start
shaking and dancing.

00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
If they're feeling
something in their body

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
know what to do, we

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:90%
get them to shake it all out.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we stop and I
have them feel their body.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.494 align:middle line:84%
Children are very
connected to their body.

00:08:59.494 --> 00:09:00.910 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
all the strategies

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
we've got in place to make
sure everybody likes us.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right?

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.674 align:middle line:90%
They're just not inhibited.

00:09:05.674 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And so after we do
some of these exercises

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:84%
then I pick their favorite
song, we put it on,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and I have them dance their way.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about all of the
things we're grateful for,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.636 align:middle line:84%
and we fill our bodies
back up with everything

00:09:17.636 --> 00:09:18.990 align:middle line:90%
we're happy about.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And so the parent can
see different skills.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I really think it's that parents
don't have this skill set,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.730 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:84%
How does the body work with
these physical ailments?

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what people
have begun to believe

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.762 align:middle line:84%
is that physical ailments
always have a physical cause.

00:09:37.762 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.814 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And I
believe that you always

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
have to get checked
out by doctor first.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Wait, do you mean
emotional ailments have

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
a physical cause, or physical
ailments have a physical cause?

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:49.931 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: So it's both.

00:09:49.931 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.304 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Sometimes
it's a physical ailment.

00:09:52.304 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:84%
If I am, you know, lacking a
certain vitamin or nutrient,

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.500 align:middle line:84%
B12 or something
like that, I may

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
have physical symptoms
resulting from that.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So there may
be a physical cause.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
assumption in medicine.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:84%
But what I find is
when someone's anxious,

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:84%
anxiety is a huge problem
in our culture, right?

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.016 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:10:13.016 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: People
don't sleep at night,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:84%
so they put themselves
on all this medication.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But when I actually asked them
what keeps them up at night,

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.122 align:middle line:90%
it's not a lack of--

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Vitamins.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Sleep--
no, sleep medication.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: It is this
thing that they've

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
been unable to say, it's
the grief that they've never

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
been able to let go of,
it's the conversation

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.155 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have
the guts to have.

00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:84%
They're in a toxic
work environment,

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
they're in a relationship
that's long since expired.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, absolutely.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: When you really
get to the root of it.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That keeps you
up, and it loops and loops

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.516 align:middle line:84%
and loops and loops until you
exhaust yourself or never do

00:10:46.516 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
fall asleep, and the next
morning you wake up so

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
exhausted that you have to
take something to stay awake.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.645 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yes.

00:10:51.645 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.315 align:middle line:84%
I've had many friends
in that situation

00:10:55.315 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and it gets just in a
very, very bad place,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%
and you wind up in rehab.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yep.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So, yeah.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.675 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: It goes out
of control pretty quick.

00:11:01.675 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hmm.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.081 align:middle line:90%
Very fast.

00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want you to take
a look at Dr. Neha here

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
talking at a Ted Talk, and
she explains a lot of this.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
-And what struck me the
most was my patients

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:90%
weren't afraid of dying.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.125 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid that they
had never lived fully.

00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So they taught me what 13 years
of medical education did not.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
That it wasn't
just the anatomical

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and the physiological
breakdown of their bodies

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:90%
that I was dealing with.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Something had begun
long, long ago.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
They had either stopped
listening to themselves

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and their body like
Brandon, they had shut down

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
their emotions
like Juan, or they

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
had given up all the things
that matter to them like Lily.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And then somehow this
catastrophic event happened,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and they showed up
metaphorically on their knees

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
with all of us
together realizing

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that these things
were all connected.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So I wish I could tell
you that I am smart enough

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
to have used these patients'
stories and learned myself.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:90%
But the truth is, I wasn't.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I had this awakening
that began in me,

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that this authentic
connection that I was creating

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:84%
for them was something I needed
to take long before they showed

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:90%
up in the ICU.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
How could I impact
them long before?

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Except I wanted to
squash that thought.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I had great
security and stability

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.632 align:middle line:84%
with a partnership
and a paycheck, OK?

00:12:51.632 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
People paid me to
take care of them

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:90%
after everything had happened.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Would anyone pay me
to do what I loved?

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So I began numbing
out my own symptoms.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I had a perfected
equation to get me

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:90%
through my hospital shifts.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It was two ice cold 16 ounce
Mountain Dews plus a king size

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Snickers bar, and I could get
through any shift you gave me.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.774 align:middle line:84%
So I heard some laughter out
there and I want to know,

00:13:20.774 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that's coming
from the students.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you know what it takes
to get through finals week.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have your
own equation, and I

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.932 align:middle line:84%
want you to think
about what that is.

00:13:31.932 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
You know this isn't
going to end well, right?

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:90%
I burned out.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I was on medical
leave June 17, 2004.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had to ask
myself the questions

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that I had so often
asked other people.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Neha, why you?

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Why burn out, and why now?

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:84%
What message had it
come to give you?

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.899 align:middle line:84%
The answers didn't
come right away for me.

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I checked it out
with some colleagues

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to see if they had ever
experienced something

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I then began to listen
to my mind and my body,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:90%
and I started journaling.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:19.976 align:middle line:84%
And what I read on those
pages scared me to death.

00:14:19.976 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't just want
to help people

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
before they ended
up in the hospital.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to create
self-care in health care.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to help
heal the healers.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to become a
master in communication

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and combine it with my
knowledge of health,

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to use that
to go and bridge nations.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.027 align:middle line:90%
That scared me.

00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you are known as the
Doctor of Communication, which

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned earlier.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So what type of signals do
you feel in your own body

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.077 align:middle line:84%
when you're not
speaking your truth?

00:14:53.077 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just to use
you as an example.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I know in my body,
it's like my intestines

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:90%
get turned into knots and bows.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.717 align:middle line:84%
So what do you feel when
you're not speaking your truth?

00:15:03.717 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Back when you didn't
speak your truth.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.816 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: No, I still feel it.

00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yes.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Now it's a friendly reminder.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Back then it was a whisper
until it became paralyzing,

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:17.850 align:middle line:84%
which is the throat constriction
turned cutting off my air.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And now at the slightest
hint of throat constricting,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
heart racing, and
stomach turning,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:84%
it's my signal that I've
just not spoken my truth.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment I ask myself,
do I need to pause and go back

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and readdress this,
renegotiate what just happened?

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Or is this something,
like, what was it

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
about this that I wasn't saying?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:90%
So my body tells me right away.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so do you
find yourself speaking

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
your truth more and
more and more now?

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Absolutely.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like, the way I
describe this experience is,

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I've become a
self-cleaning oven.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know,
something happens.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is,
I don't go talking

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.780 align:middle line:90%
to everyone about everything.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:90%
But I have this three time rule.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.704 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: The first time
something happens, I notice it.

00:16:04.704 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
The second time it
happens, I mentally

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:84%
put it in my mental
filing cabinet.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I might need this.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.048 align:middle line:84%
The third time it
happens I say, hey Lisa.

00:16:16.048 --> 00:16:19.045 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wanted to talk to
you about yesterday at lunch,

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:90%
our meeting.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And it'll take about 15 minutes.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering when's
a good time for you.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%
You actually go right for it.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I was raised with that
good girl attitude as well,

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.240 align:middle line:84%
because I recall situations
in conversations,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could have said that
and I wanted to say this,

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So in your body, so
you're teaching people

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
to really feel that
sensation in your body.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
when it's not truth.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: We do.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it
actually sometimes,

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:84%
when other people are
as communicative as you

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
are and say exactly
what they're feeling,

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:84%
it makes me feel awkward
when they say that.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so ingrained in me.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:90%
But I want a step.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I want a process
that can show me

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
how to nip it right
away, how to do that.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Because that's going to be
key for me in the future.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So say your boss,
someone who you know.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.911 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to get fired.

00:17:14.911 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:84%
This would lead to, like,
you losing their job,

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.914 align:middle line:84%
How do you say to them, look,
you're not treating me nicely.

00:17:21.914 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:84%
How do you say
that to your boss?

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right?

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.688 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right.

00:17:28.688 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Or your spouse or
your sister, right?

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.167 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: OK.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:90%
So there's a few steps here.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:84%
The first one is, you have to
know what those signals are.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like you
know what yours are.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Your body talks to you.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Your physiology talks to you.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I call it your
physical intelligence.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, my
stomach turns to stone.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.373 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's an
uncomfortable feeling.

00:17:46.373 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So most people will go
first and numb that out.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.007 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: So-- excuse me.

00:17:52.007 --> 00:17:54.090 align:middle line:84%
What they'll do is they'll
go get a chocolate chip

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.239 align:middle line:90%
cookie and a latte.

00:17:55.239 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: OK?

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
actually tuning in.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.046 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And when you do,
there's a lot of ways to tune

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:01.920 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Some people take deep breaths,
they manage themselves.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It's that discomfort
in someone's body

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that stops them from
speaking their truth.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:90%
But this is the secret.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: The secret is
you come to a decision point

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:90%
many times in your day.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Do I tell the truth, do I not?

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.227 align:middle line:84%
Do I say what I really
mean, do I hold back?

00:18:20.227 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: The deal is that
if you feel that discomfort

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and you numb it, you're going to
get a short term effect, which

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
is your short term high
of just avoiding it.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Like, ooh, got away with that.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.571 align:middle line:90%
I escaped the lion.

00:18:36.571 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right?

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, ooh.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank God I escaped
that conflict.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But long term, every time
you look in the mirror,

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:84%
you're going to respect
yourself a little bit less.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Wow, why didn't I
have the courage

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:90%
to stand up and say that?

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
How come I didn't say what I
really meant in that meeting?

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
How come I didn't tell them
that that wasn't OK, right?

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Now the flip side of that is
you come to that decision point

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and you become aware of
the physical intelligence

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.287 align:middle line:90%
And you decide, you know what?

00:19:03.287 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use my breathing,
I'm going to calm myself,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to deal with
the short term discomfort--

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.530 align:middle line:84%
not the short term high of
avoiding it or numbing it.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take the
short term discomfort

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and lean into that
discomfort for the long term

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.380 align:middle line:84%
high of liking yourself, of
having great relationships,

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:90%
of investing in your life.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So one thing I
don't say is, this

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:90%
is going to ever become easy.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not even easy for me.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:29.707 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you said lean into--

00:19:29.707 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: The discomfort.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:90%
It's only short term.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing that gets
these signals to go away

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:84%
is that you actually
acknowledge and address them.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That you say
something about it.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yes.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.281 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So that's
the first thing.

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is, you've
got to know your signals.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know
that there is going

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:90%
to be a little discomfort.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's just your
body talking to you.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:48.772 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hmm.

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And then lean into it and
then override the wave,

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:90%
or ride the wave--

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Ride the wave.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --so that you
can have the greater

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:90%
gain, which is that freedom.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.005 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: But it's
going to actually

00:19:57.005 --> 00:19:58.061 align:middle line:90%
be a dip of discomfort.

00:19:58.061 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to feel
like riding that wave.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
It's actually going to feel like
when you're on a roller coaster

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and you're just going over.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, this doesn't
feel comfortable.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Then the second
thing you want to do

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
is when you're talking--
let's say it's your boss, OK?

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:84%
What you want to say-- or,
let's say you're my boss

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and I need to have
this conversation.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: How about that?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.548 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: OK, that
would be an easy way.

00:20:18.548 --> 00:20:22.727 align:middle line:84%
If I start off and I say to you,
you're not treating me well.

00:20:22.727 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you see how all
of a sudden, aren't

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.842 align:middle line:84%
some walls going
to go up for you?

00:20:25.842 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: OK.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.012 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:20:27.012 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: It's like this.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:90%
You're pointing fingers.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: But what
I need to do is

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I need to share with
you-- because I've already

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.640 align:middle line:90%
set up the conversation.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.098 align:middle line:84%
I've told you what time I need,
when's a good time for you?

00:20:37.098 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:90%
So you're listening, OK?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going
to say, hey Lisa.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, thank you for
having this meeting with me.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to talk
to you about something

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I experienced yesterday
in our group meeting.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just noticed
that when you said,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:84%
thank you Team A for
doing what you wanted

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and making the right
choice, I noticed

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't feel included
because I'm a consultant.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
in that moment,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
I just felt a little
bit distanced from you,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.685 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't really
feel acknowledged.

00:21:10.685 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I was wondering,
did you notice that?

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel that I
contributed to the project?

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:18.859 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Do you get it?

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Did it take a long time?

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.562 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, but
it's penetrating.

00:21:23.562 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But who am I talking about
in that conversation?

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.076 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: I'm acknowledging
the vulnerability

00:21:29.076 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
of why that felt
so icky inside me.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm clear.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I've set up a time with you.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
me that you hear me

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.137 align:middle line:84%
and that it's a
good time for you.

00:21:38.137 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then it
doesn't necessarily

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
matter what the boss
says, because you're

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:90%
taken care of in that moment.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And I've
spoken my truth.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, you've
spoken your truth.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: My boss may
say, oh, I didn't do that.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I included you.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But it doesn't matter.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.348 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: It doesn't matter.

00:21:51.348 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
You listen and you can
even say, like, oh,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:84%
what I hear you saying
is this, this, and this.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like you thought
you did include me.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're telling me?

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.948 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love the way
you're talking about it,

00:22:02.948 --> 00:22:05.844 align:middle line:84%
just drop into that feeling and
feel it and then communicate.

00:22:05.844 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Allow
it to inform you.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Allow it to.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.379 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:08.379 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this
video and you can see.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It's about meeting
Dr. Neha, and she

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.585 align:middle line:84%
explains a lot of the
communication techniques

00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:90%
that she uses.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:90%
-Hi, I'm Doctor Neha.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you're
here and that you're

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:84%
interested in learning more
about the communication cure.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning of
a wonderful journey where

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:84%
you are going to learn how
to improve your health,

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
decrease your stress levels,
strengthen your relationships,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.144 align:middle line:84%
and create the
life that you want.

00:22:43.144 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:10%
So let's get
started, because I've

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:10%
got a lot to share with you.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.100 align:middle line:10%
What most people don't
understand is that clear,

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:10%
direct communication is
directly related to your health.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
As a medical and
communication expert,

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I travel all over the world,
helping heal toxic dynamics

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
in home and work
relationships that

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
are literally
making people sick.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So people don't come
to me saying, "Doctor,

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I have an I can't communicate
with my boss problem."

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
What they say is, "I
have a stomachache,"

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:84%
or "I have a headache," or
"I can't sleep at night."

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to teach you how to
interpret these signals coming

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
from your body in order
to connect what you think

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
to how you're feeling,
to what you're wanting,

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and, ultimately, what
you're saying and creating

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:90%
So let's start with the basics.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Your headache isn't
an Advil deficiency.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:84%
There are many
ways that your body

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:84%
tries to communicate with you,
especially when you're out

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:90%
of alignment.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at this
physiologically

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.210 align:middle line:90%
and tell you what's happening.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you say yes
to staying at work

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and taking an extra
shift when you really

00:23:55.690 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
need to be at your son or
daughter's soccer game.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you say yes when
you really mean no?

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Because pay attention
to what happens next.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Your body will
give you a signal.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's your
stomach dropping,

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.350 align:middle line:84%
maybe your heart
will start racing.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:90%
For me it's throat constriction.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, your
unconscious mind

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:84%
is trying to talk to you
through your physical body

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and tell you that you just said
yes when you really meant no.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:84%

has happened is

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.566 align:middle line:84%
we seem to think that our
head and what we're thinking

00:28:16.566 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and what we're getting
from the outside world

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.470 align:middle line:90%
is where we get our information.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And even though it's only an
18 inch drop to your heart,

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:84%
I actually believe this is
where we get our information.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there's a way in
our busy, over stimulated world

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
that we have begun
to function just

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:84%
from our head and
our thoughts, and we

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.810 align:middle line:84%
get most of that input
from the outside world.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what
we've sacrificed

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:84%
is actually turning up the
volume of our own hearts

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and what we want and
listening to ourselves.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:84%

00:30:57.877 --> 00:30:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: In trying
to have a conversation?

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.527 align:middle line:90%
In speaking their truth.

00:31:01.527 --> 00:31:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Is that they
think their truth is

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.390 align:middle line:90%
about blaming somebody else.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.612 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They did this to me.

00:31:06.612 --> 00:31:08.195 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: You did
this, you did that.

00:31:08.195 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.158 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right?

00:31:09.158 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And really, what I
want to say is, the way

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that I-- so this is
what I heard or saw.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.464 align:middle line:84%
This is the story
I made up about it.

00:31:17.464 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
know if it's true yet.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.838 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, true.

00:31:19.838 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You can make a big
story up about it.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.040 align:middle line:84%
This, then this, then they
said that and they felt that.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: You know what?

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:90%
And I saw her talking to him.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
they were about?

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.370 align:middle line:90%
They were talking about us.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.950 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.221 align:middle line:90%
I knew-- did you see them?

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, I've
never asked them

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.450 align:middle line:90%
what they were talking about.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:84%
They might have
just been talking

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:84%
about the latest show
they're going to.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:35.211 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:35.211 --> 00:31:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: But I am so sure
that my insecurities and what

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.922 align:middle line:90%
stories I'm making up are true.

00:31:39.922 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's the second big
mistake I think people make,

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:90%
which is they don't get curious.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I say
is get curious, not furious.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Because first figure out
if whatever you're thinking

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.596 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:31:54.596 --> 00:31:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
really what they

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.761 align:middle line:84%
need to do is be clear
about what they want

00:31:57.761 --> 00:32:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and what they value in order
to make clear decisions,

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:01.718 align:middle line:84%
and know what you want
to say to someone.

00:32:01.718 --> 00:32:03.892 align:middle line:84%
What do you want out
of this conversation?

00:32:03.892 --> 00:32:04.975 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What do you value?

00:32:04.975 --> 00:32:06.091 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you value?

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So think about
that ahead of time.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.420 align:middle line:84%
You want to improve
the relationship.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to let go
of the relationship?

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: That's right.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you think
about that ahead of time.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.056 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah, you want
to know, what do you want?

00:32:18.056 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's more that we
can grab onto tools when

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.435 align:middle line:90%
we're in that moment of, oh god.

00:32:22.435 --> 00:32:25.466 align:middle line:84%
You can just file it through
in your mind and go, OK.

00:32:25.466 --> 00:32:26.590 align:middle line:90%
This, this, this, and this.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Not that it disconnects you
from your emotion, but sometimes

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.814 align:middle line:84%
it just is a great
starting point.

00:32:30.814 --> 00:32:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And it actually helps you
process your emotions.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if I say yes to you
to doing something and then

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.600 align:middle line:90%
I notice that I'm afraid, right?

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.041 align:middle line:84%
I told you when I said I'd do
the book deal I was petrified,

00:32:44.041 --> 00:32:44.540 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And in that fear now,
now that helps me get curious.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.372 align:middle line:84%
Am I fearful because
I don't think

00:32:51.372 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be a good book?

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.022 align:middle line:84%
Am I fearful because I
haven't written a book before?

00:32:55.022 --> 00:32:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Do I think I'm going to fail?

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.771 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:32:56.771 --> 00:32:59.530 align:middle line:90%
So our emotions give us clues.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Our emotions are just a guide.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have such a-- I
mean, maybe it's just practice.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But you have such a
great way of really,

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.500 align:middle line:84%
truly knowing your
feelings even.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you
know your feelings?

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.782 align:middle line:84%
Because I would just
stop at I'm afraid.

00:33:13.782 --> 00:33:14.615 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't know why.

00:33:14.615 --> 00:33:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able to research
that that fast in that moment

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.719 align:middle line:84%
when you have a five minute
interaction with somebody.

00:33:20.719 --> 00:33:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's sometimes
how deals happen

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.620 align:middle line:84%
is that you create sparks,
ideas happen, and then

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:84%
you commit yourself, you
over commit yourself.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't figure out how I
feel about it until much later.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.803 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: OK, so you're one of
the people-- which, this isn't

00:33:32.803 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
uncommon-- you need time
to process something.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So your job is
to find your pause button,

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
like a DVD player or a piece of
technology has a pause button.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:90%
So do you.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So you get to say,
if I make you--

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.310 align:middle line:84%
let's say you made me a
great offer to do something.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say,
Lisa, thank you so much.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, this was so
generous of you.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And I notice right now my
heart's racing a little bit,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.003 align:middle line:90%
and so I know I'm excited.

00:33:59.003 --> 00:34:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to just take the
weekend to think about it

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and kind of sleep on it
and kind of brainstorm it.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I so appreciate you, and
I will be back to you

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.280 align:middle line:90%
on Monday morning.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:90%
Does that work for you?

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.291 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was a great
way of saying something.

00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:90%
How liberating.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.408 align:middle line:84%
Are there different styles of
people that you've encountered?

00:34:17.408 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Oh yeah.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.449 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK well, what
are some of the others?

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Some people
will say yes in the moment.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.315 align:middle line:84%
And what I'll have
to work with them on

00:34:24.315 --> 00:34:27.199 align:middle line:84%
is how to renegotiate that
so it would sound like this.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.929 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Hey Lisa,
you know yesterday

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.710 align:middle line:84%
when you asked me about that
incredible, generous offer

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.659 align:middle line:90%
that you gave me?

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:37.179 align:middle line:84%
I noticed last night
I didn't sleep.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that I just
kept ruminating over the fact

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:84%
that I've never
done this before.

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm going to be
someone who needs extra help.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:46.699 align:middle line:84%
And so I need to talk
to you about that,

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.929 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think it
could be done by Friday.

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.747 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering, could
I have this support?

00:34:50.747 --> 00:34:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Would you be willing to
help me with this support?

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.936 align:middle line:90%
And could we extend it one week?

00:34:54.936 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's great.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.790 align:middle line:90%
I do that all the time.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:58.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Over committing.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds so great, and
I'm so caught up in the moment.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.422 align:middle line:84%
And then I realize,
there's not enough time

00:35:04.422 --> 00:35:06.046 align:middle line:84%
in the world to do
something like that.

00:35:06.046 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And you
want to name that.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.256 align:middle line:84%
When you're in with people and
you've just over committed,

00:35:10.256 --> 00:35:14.430 align:middle line:84%
or you hear yourself doing
it, what you say is, hey.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I love the idea you've
just presented to me.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.980 align:middle line:90%
My tendency is to over commit.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to make a full
commitment to you.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Let me think about
this overnight,

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get
back to you tomorrow.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because there's
opportunity everywhere.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: There is opportunity.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that's in
the back of my mind going,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.964 align:middle line:84%
wow, this would be
a great opportunity.

00:35:30.964 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But then something else
is going to have to go

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and I need to think about that.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's, you know, what
are the consequences of that?

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And I need to talk
to that person.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm having the
conversation with you

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I should be having
with someone else.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:41.719 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:90%
But thank you for that.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
here a video of more tools.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:47.948 align:middle line:84%
These are called the
i-Five communication tools

00:35:47.948 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Neha.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:58.020 align:middle line:90%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.820 align:middle line:84%
-Hi, I'm Dr. Neha, a physician,
communication expert,

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and creator of the i-Five
conversation, a practical tool

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that's at the heart of
the communication cure.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The i-Five conversation
is for anyone

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:15.130 align:middle line:84%
who's interested in handling
challenging conversations

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
with ease in order to
improve their interpersonal

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:84%
relationships, decrease
your stress levels,

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:23.760 align:middle line:90%
and improve your overall health.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The i-Five conversation makes
five important connections

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to have
challenging conversations

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.290 align:middle line:90%
with ease.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.370 align:middle line:10%
These five components
are interpreting

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:39.140 align:middle line:10%
your body, thoughts,
feelings, desires,

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.830 align:middle line:10%
and integrating all of
those into taking action

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.730 align:middle line:10%
in order to have
honest dialogue.

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:45.760 align:middle line:10%
The i-Five conversation
can best be

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.780 align:middle line:10%
understood by using an example.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
two interpretations

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.170 align:middle line:90%
of the same scenario.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Suppose it's the morning
of your performance review

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and you walk by your
boss's office, say hello.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Your boss looks
up, says nothing,

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and then looks down
and continues texting.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple ways that you
can interpret this interaction.

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:15.310 align:middle line:84%
The first aspect is interpreting
your body's signals.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They come in both
externally and internally.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Externally, your body gathers
data through your five senses.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:30.130 align:middle line:84%
What you see, hear,
taste, touch, and smell.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.970 align:middle line:84%
In this scenario, you saw
your boss in his office.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:90%
You said hello.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.320 align:middle line:90%
You saw him look up at you.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:84%
You heard nothing, and you
saw him resume texting.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So the senses used to
gather data in this scenario

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
would have been your
sight and your hearing.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So your body also communicates
with you internally.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.310 align:middle line:84%
It sends you
messages and signals.

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:84%
For example, when your
boss didn't answer you,

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:84%
your heart may have started
racing or your stomach turning.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.900 align:middle line:84%
These are also
indications from your body

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.910 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
pay attention to.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
As you interpret
your body's data,

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:84%
you then move into
the second part

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.810 align:middle line:84%
of the i-Five conversation,
your thoughts.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:84%
From what you're
just experienced

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.090 align:middle line:84%
you gather this data
and you put it together

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.254 align:middle line:84%
to create a story
about what it means.

00:38:20.254 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
You might have thought that
because your boss didn't

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.800 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge you, it meant
that you didn't perform

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.010 align:middle line:90%
as well as you did last year.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So the story you
make up will lead

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.470 align:middle line:84%
to how you feel,
and feelings are

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
the third component of
the i-Five conversation.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
In this scenario,
you would likely

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.130 align:middle line:84%
be feeling disappointment,
worry, or fear

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.050 align:middle line:90%
about your upcoming review.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So this leads us to
the fourth component

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.610 align:middle line:84%
of the i-Five conversation,
interpreting your desires.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So from this last experience if
you felt disappointment, worry,

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:84%
or fear about your
upcoming review,

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.230 align:middle line:84%
this may lead you to want
to talk to your coworkers

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and tell them that your
boss is in a bad mood

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and to avoid him at all costs.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:08.800 align:middle line:84%
It may even cause you to want
to avoid your review altogether.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.660 align:middle line:10%
The final component of
the i-Five conversation

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.680 align:middle line:10%
is integrating all
the other components

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:10%
in order to take action.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.490 align:middle line:10%
So in this experience
you may show up

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.130 align:middle line:10%
at your review with
closed body language

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:23.510 align:middle line:10%
and be unreceptive to feedback.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at this
through another interpretation

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.460 align:middle line:84%
of the i-Five conversation,
what you gathered objectively

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.180 align:middle line:84%
through your body externally
through what you saw

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and what you heard,
as well as internally.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Your heart racing,
your stomach turning.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Those remain the same
in the second scenario.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:84%
What's different in this
scenario is your thoughts

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not
you get curious.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:84%
It's about the story you make up
about the data you've gathered.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.490 align:middle line:84%
In this example, instead
what if you chose to think,

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if my boss is OK?

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if he has
something going on?

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some way that
I can be of support to him.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Or better yet, I
wonder if he heard me.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:84%
If that's the story that
you make up from the data

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that you gathered,
it's obvious that you

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.730 align:middle line:84%
may feel different feelings
from the first scenario.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Rather than feeling
disappointment, worry, or fear

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
around your review,
you may be feeling

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.840 align:middle line:84%
curiosity or concern
for your boss.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.010 align:middle line:84%
This will lead you to a
very different desire.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.330 align:middle line:10%
Instead of dreading
your performance review,

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.570 align:middle line:10%
you may actually be
looking forward to it

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and show up and take action
by being open, curious,

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.040 align:middle line:10%
and receptive.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.530 align:middle line:10%
From this example, you can
see how the same scenario can

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:10%
create dramatically
different outcomes based

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.480 align:middle line:10%
on the story you make up and
how you interpret the five

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:10%
components of the
i-Five conversation.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.160 align:middle line:10%
Those five components, again,
include your body, thoughts,

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.620 align:middle line:10%
feelings, desires, and how
you integrate all of those

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.470 align:middle line:10%
into taking action.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:10.256 align:middle line:84%
How you interpret and integrate
the i-Five conversation

00:41:10.256 --> 00:41:10.755 align:middle line:90%
matters.

00:41:10.755 --> 00:41:29.084 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: I was
talking earlier about

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.795 align:middle line:84%
feeling uncomfortable
with people

00:41:32.795 --> 00:41:35.464 align:middle line:90%
who really speak the truth.

00:41:35.464 --> 00:41:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:37.790 align:middle line:90%
So my husband's like that.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:41.710 align:middle line:84%
He will tell you how
it feels instantly,

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be over there
crawling into a corner

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and embarrassed because he
spoke his truth so fast.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So is that a different
style of a person

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.090 align:middle line:84%
who speaks really fast
about their truth,

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and then me who is on
the other side of it?

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Is there a way to soft?

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So how do I express
my feelings when

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:84%
he's making me feel
uncomfortable without

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.350 align:middle line:84%
invalidating him
speaking his truth?

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:08.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the first
thing is, he isn't

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.710 align:middle line:90%
making you feel uncomfortable.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.890 align:middle line:84%
That would be like him
being able to go like this

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:90%
and go like that.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: OK?

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He can't.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So he can't
make you feel comfortable.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.540 align:middle line:84%
What you're noticing is
is that you're actually

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:24.480 align:middle line:84%
choosing to react in a way that
is feeling uncomfortable, OK?

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.610 align:middle line:84%

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.940 align:middle line:90%
used to speak their truth.

00:43:05.792 --> 00:43:06.750 align:middle line:90%

Yeah.

that you become that
eight-year-old little girl.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:84%
It's called in your
amygdala in your brain

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.560 align:middle line:84%
where it stores the
memories of things

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that felt traumatic or unsafe
for you when you were little.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So all of the sudden,
you become as effective

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:84%
as that eight-year-old
little girl.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.724 align:middle line:84%
And so what you
want to do is-- I

00:43:31.724 --> 00:43:33.140 align:middle line:84%
don't know if your
husband's going

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.820 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate me saying
all this, but here we go.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Next time he blurts
something out,

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take
a really deep breath

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.704 align:middle line:84%
and notice the physical
sensations that

00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:90%
are happening for you.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: OK?

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
When he's having that
moment of just saying it,

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine that
he's pretty uncomfortable

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.711 align:middle line:90%
and stressed too, OK?

00:43:53.711 --> 00:43:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And usually when
people are blurting something

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.690 align:middle line:84%
out or they're just
saying it like that,

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.970 align:middle line:84%
it's because they're
dispelling their discomfort.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And so if he was a little
kid, what would you

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:84%
do to that little--
What would you say?

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:84%
What would you do with that
little kid who had that moment?

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I realize that you might
feel uncomfortable right now.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah, you might even
pick him up and give him a hug,

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:17.369 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:17.369 --> 00:44:18.380 align:middle line:90%
If he was little.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: He just
happens to be your size

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and connected to your heart and
love and all that stuff, right?

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: So what I
want you to do next time

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:31.110 align:middle line:84%
is imagine him little and
he's having this experience.

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
see yourself as big.

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:34.550 align:middle line:90%
You're not eight anymore.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.092 align:middle line:90%
You're grown up.

00:44:36.092 --> 00:44:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to imagine
him, and what would you do?

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.050 align:middle line:90%
You'd give compassion.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:84%
You'd get curious about
that child, right?

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening,
and what's hurting him?

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:48.679 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to just take that
moment, take a deep breath.

00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that he's trying
to communicate something

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to you that he thinks
you might not be getting.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And get curious
and compassionate.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I want you to ask yourself, what
would curiosity and compassion

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.030 align:middle line:90%
do now?

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ask myself
in that moment?

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:07.835 align:middle line:84%
And then just do that, just take
a minute or hug him or agree?

00:45:07.835 --> 00:45:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: You might not want to
hug him in that moment, right?

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that might be
too big of a stretch.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.775 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: But what you might
want to say-- otherwise you

00:45:14.775 --> 00:45:16.650 align:middle line:84%
make a pact with him
outside of that time.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.049 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, good idea.

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And it
can be like, honey,

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.420 align:middle line:84%
when we do this what it
means is we just stop.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.879 align:middle line:84%
And you figure out
how you connect.

00:45:23.879 --> 00:45:26.336 align:middle line:84%
If it is through a hug and you
feel like you could do that,

00:45:26.336 --> 00:45:27.000 align:middle line:90%
try it.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.079 align:middle line:84%
You can always renegotiate
it if it doesn't work.

00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:30.620 align:middle line:84%
If what you do is
go like this and it

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:84%
means we both get to go
for a walk in 15 minutes

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and meet back here and have
tea and do our own thing

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and have that talk, we do that.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But two people need to
negotiate between each other

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.980 align:middle line:90%
how to make that different.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And set it
up ahead of time.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.500 align:middle line:84%
We have a phrase
called white flag.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.595 align:middle line:84%
Like, if there's a moment
where we're both off the rails,

00:45:49.595 --> 00:45:50.470 align:middle line:90%
we say, "White flag."

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:51.347 align:middle line:90%
Walk away.

00:45:51.347 --> 00:45:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll figure it
out later, but that's it.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.763 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: But what are you
going to do in those moments

00:45:55.763 --> 00:45:59.720 align:middle line:84%
when you do get to figure it out
later that changes the outcome?

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And for you it's going to
be curiosity and compassion.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.437 align:middle line:84%
You think it's for him,
but it's actually not.

00:46:05.437 --> 00:46:06.270 align:middle line:90%
You know what it is?

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's for that
eight-year-old little girl

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that was scared, that felt
like her voice didn't matter.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It's for her that you're
becoming compassionate.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you start doing
that, your husband actually

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.700 align:middle line:84%
ends up being your greatest
teacher because he allows

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:23.030 align:middle line:84%
you to access that little
girl and help heal her.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So he actually becomes
a big gift in your life.

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Talking about a gift.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You are a
gift to many people.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.692 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Thank you.

00:46:31.692 --> 00:46:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk
about headaches.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:35.660 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever see a
relationship between people

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that maybe don't speak their
truth and headaches, or even

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:41.350 align:middle line:90%
severe migraines?

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Absolutely.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Talk about that.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Absolutely.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:48.540 align:middle line:84%
So I have clients that
have felt-- I really

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.712 align:middle line:84%
believe at the core, we may
look different externally.

00:46:51.712 --> 00:46:52.920 align:middle line:90%
We may be different cultures.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.420 align:middle line:84%
We may have been
raised differently.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But at our core, my
belief is that all of us

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:59.770 align:middle line:84%
want to be heard,
seen, and valued.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is absolutely true.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And so whether or
not someone feels those things,

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.090 align:middle line:84%
for me I've seen a pretty
strong link to many signals,

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:16.040 align:middle line:90%
but headaches is a big one.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And often sometimes
clients who even

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:23.510 align:middle line:84%
have medical doctors
in their family,

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:27.920 align:middle line:84%
the only way that they can get
a timeout or a break in the end

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.340 align:middle line:90%
is when they're ill.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So the way that I can
get you off my back

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:35.752 align:middle line:84%
is-- and they don't
do it consciously.

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:36.960 align:middle line:90%
They're not even aware of it.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.480 align:middle line:84%
They're not even
aware of the link.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But the way that I can do
that is by, when I am ill,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I get attention, love,
and care from you,

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.320 align:middle line:84%
because you understand
that language.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or I get an excuse
to take a break from you.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.944 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah, and
I get to be quiet.

00:47:50.944 --> 00:47:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I get peace.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I get space around me.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So aside from the
people, the other piece

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.480 align:middle line:84%
is when people don't have a
medical community around them,

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.680 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes it's when they
get the love and healing care

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and attention where someone
is just tender with them.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:06.990 align:middle line:90%
They get that peace and quiet.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or even in the
case of a migraine,

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.680 align:middle line:84%
you get to turn off every--
maybe there's no other excuse

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:84%
to turn everything
off in your life.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:15.790 align:middle line:84%
You can turn all the
lights out and it's dark

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.500 align:middle line:90%
and you get to be with yourself.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: And you get to
give yourself the excuse.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.260 align:middle line:84%
You get to get off the
hook with yourself.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And along those
lines, breathing.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Asthma.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Asthma.

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Where do you see--
you have a technique

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.930 align:middle line:84%
that you teach
around breath, right?

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:33.977 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Yeah, I do.

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's really just
simple breathing.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:40.050 align:middle line:84%
First of all, stress exacerbates
or causes more than 95%

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:40.680 align:middle line:90%
of illness.

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.319 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:48:41.319 --> 00:48:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's been
very well proven.

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:43.145 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right.

00:48:43.145 --> 00:48:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've heard higher.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Even higher, right?

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.323 align:middle line:90%
Some people say it's 100%.

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything is induced.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Stress also decreases our
immune function, right?

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And so our immune function is
when we repair things, right?

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:58.147 align:middle line:90%
It's our defense system.

00:48:58.147 --> 00:48:58.980 align:middle line:90%
It takes care of us.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And so asthma is a reactive
airway disease, right?

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that's like the your
lungs and all the branches

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.620 align:middle line:84%
of the air sacs in there,
they have muscles around them.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
reaction that happens.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's from
an allergy outside,

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.474 align:middle line:84%
whether it's from an
emotional response,

00:49:15.474 --> 00:49:16.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a reactivity
that happens.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:18.501 align:middle line:90%
And you cannot take in breath.

00:49:18.501 --> 00:49:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constriction of

>>SANGWAN: And so the
interesting thing, yeah.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:26.840 align:middle line:90%
There is a link.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.580 align:middle line:90%
There's a link to cold weather.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a link to
all sorts of things.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I do believe there's
also an emotional link.

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Of course that's my lens, so
I realize that I sometimes

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.670 align:middle line:90%
see it through that lens.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And stress gets a
big bucket, right?

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's around what actually
causes that at the bottom.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So you were asking
about breathing, right?

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.640 align:middle line:90%
So really quick.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.070 align:middle line:90%
It's simple, deep breathing.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:48.653 align:middle line:84%
But what I would
find when I went down

00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:51.410 align:middle line:84%
to the emergency department,
who in the emergency department

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.626 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have the thought
going them that I might die?

00:49:54.626 --> 00:49:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's sitting in that
emergency department thinking

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:57.740 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS]

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.471 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:49:58.471 --> 00:49:58.970 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's how
they got there, yeah.

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: OK, so they're
all sitting there.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So I would get
called downstairs.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, "Dr.
Sangwan, this person

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is having a heart
rate of 110, and we

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.680 align:middle line:84%
think that you
need to see them."

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd come downstairs
and they would

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.340 align:middle line:90%
be breathing just like this.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.310 align:middle line:90%
[SHARP GASPS]

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:19.522 align:middle line:90%
No, doc, I'm breathing.

00:50:19.522 --> 00:50:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But what they were doing
was reverse breathing.

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.151 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to show you
right now is to actually--

00:50:24.151 --> 00:50:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
uncross our legs.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:26.546 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: OK?

00:50:26.546 --> 00:50:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Put our feet on the ground.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And this helps with
any kind of anxiety.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what you want to do
is you have to-- anxiety

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:34.630 align:middle line:84%
is a fear about
what might happen.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.772 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to
control the future.

00:50:36.772 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: OK?

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So one of the antidotes to
that, and I speak about this,

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.220 align:middle line:84%
is that you want to
get in the present.

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You need to get someone
who's having a panic

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:48.590 align:middle line:84%
attack in the present
moment, right?

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:51.006 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing you do is
get their feet on the ground,

00:50:51.006 --> 00:50:52.900 align:middle line:90%
get them to take a deep breath.

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And when they do
I'm going ask you

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:59.250 align:middle line:84%
to feel your ribcage
expanding and contracting.

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:01.695 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness to your ribcage
expanding and contracting.

00:51:01.695 --> 00:51:03.654 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have to
breathe deep to do that.

00:51:03.654 --> 00:51:04.361 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Right?

00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're taught as women,
hold your stomach in.

>>SANGWAN: OK.

Now you're going to put your
hand on your abdomen, OK?

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:13.728 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to take
a nice deep breath in.

00:51:13.728 --> 00:51:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I want
your hand to move outward.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out,
I want your belly button

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.790 align:middle line:90%
to move back towards your spine.

it brings oxygen to your brain.

[SHARP GASPS]

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:50.870 align:middle line:90%
--they're doing this, OK?

>>LISA: Or just
chest up breathing.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SANGWAN: Chest up, right?

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.460 align:middle line:10%
So where does the best oxygen
exchange occur in your body?

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.960 align:middle line:10%
Your lungs go all
the way down here.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.990 align:middle line:10%
And it occurs at the
bases of your lungs.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So we don't usually--
we're running around

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.640 align:middle line:90%
in our busy world.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.852 align:middle line:84%
We only use this-- hey, do
you want to go to lunch?

00:52:04.852 --> 00:52:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Hey, can you get that for me?

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.659 align:middle line:10%
We're only using this
much of our lungs.

00:52:08.659 --> 00:52:10.700 align:middle line:10%
So what happens here is,
you have this diaphragm.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.500 align:middle line:10%
It's a thin muscle.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.970 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like an umbrella.

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's below your lungs
and above your stomach, OK?

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.020 align:middle line:84%
When you take a
deep breath in, that

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.370 align:middle line:84%
must flatten in order
to keep the air going.

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:26.330 align:middle line:90%
That triggers your vagus nerve.

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And that slows down your
heart rate, calms you.

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.204 align:middle line:84%
You start to get air,
oxygen to your brain.

00:52:33.204 --> 00:52:35.120 align:middle line:84%
All of the sudden now
you're thinking clearly,

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.680 align:middle line:84%
creative options, instead of
do I have to get out of here

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.340 align:middle line:90%
or shut down?

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.965 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love the
medical definitions.

00:52:39.965 --> 00:52:40.844 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:52:40.844 --> 00:52:42.885 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve that runs
through the whole body.

00:52:42.885 --> 00:52:45.129 align:middle line:84%
And it controls the
central nervous system?

00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SANGWAN: It hits your
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:49.100 align:middle line:90%
which is your relaxation system.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And it runs through
the diaphragm.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
stimulating the diaphragm,

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:54.690 align:middle line:90%
you're stimulating your vagus.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, that's fabulous.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.660 align:middle line:84%

>>SANGWAN: Yeah.

00:53:00.352 --> 00:53:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it helps you make
decisions, become clearer.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I actually was

-Hi, this is Dr. Neha,
and welcome to my vlog.

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Today's topic is on
decision fatigue.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Several of my clients
over the past few weeks

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.530 align:middle line:84%
have been asking
me, "Dr. Neha, how

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:30.262 align:middle line:84%
do I know, if I've
made a decision,

00:53:30.262 --> 00:53:31.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it was the
right decision or not?

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's about
going to the movies

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:37.670 align:middle line:84%
with a friend when I was
really tired after work,

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:40.570 align:middle line:90%
or am I in the right job?

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:42.490 align:middle line:90%
How do you actually know?"

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:45.950 align:middle line:84%
So it brought me
back to my life,

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:48.310 align:middle line:84%
because they often
ask me, "Dr. Neha,

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.200 align:middle line:84%
how did you become
a doctor of science,

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.810 align:middle line:84%
initially a doctor of
medicine, and then transition

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:56.530 align:middle line:84%
into being a doctor
of communication?"

00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I want to
say it wasn't that easy.

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I woke up
one day and I just knew.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.100 align:middle line:84%
It was a series of
experiences where

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.340 align:middle line:84%
I had to listen to my
body and pay attention.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.090 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to do
today is just distill

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that down to a few
easy steps for you.

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So I used to work in a
more corporate environment

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.120 align:middle line:90%
and also in a hospital.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'd notice is
I did well for a few months,

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and then my energy would
continue to go down and down.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I would feel drained.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately I would feel
like I was almost a burnout.

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I would rest
or take a vacation,

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and then I would be
back to normal again.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And this went on and
on until I finally

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:41.920 align:middle line:84%
started getting so tired
that I wasn't recovering.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
for me was I noticed

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:48.790 align:middle line:84%
when I was with my clients or my
patients, I really got charged.

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of energy when
we had a really good exchange

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.410 align:middle line:84%
about their life and what
their illness meant to them

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.640 align:middle line:84%
in their life, and how it would
help them change their life.

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of
energy in me when

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd go to communication
workshops.

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Or when I'd be talking to
a girlfriend on a Saturday,

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:09.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, about how
to change my life

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:13.744 align:middle line:84%
and how to feel inspired
about what's coming up.

00:55:13.744 --> 00:55:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We would have these
great conversations.

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:18.410 align:middle line:84%
All of these items were
around communication.

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.780 align:middle line:90%
So I started to pay attention.

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I also learned that I
enjoyed working with people.

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm a doctor.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Working with patients
was fantastic.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:29.820 align:middle line:90%
So I knew that I valued people.

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I started to notice
when I felt more energy.

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:36.575 align:middle line:84%
So I felt more energy when I
was around people and we we

00:55:36.575 --> 00:55:38.700 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
communication.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So what I call-- the problem
with decision fatigue is, A,

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.956 align:middle line:84%
people are not paying attention
to their body's signals

00:55:48.956 --> 00:55:49.830 align:middle line:90%
that they're getting.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I used to get
throat constriction.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I used to have my
stomach turning.

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't paying
attention to any of that.

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I was just powering
through my day.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So my first question is, do
you know when you have energy?

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.220 align:middle line:84%
When you feel you've
increased your energy,

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.535 align:middle line:90%
how does your body tell you?

00:56:06.535 --> 00:56:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel
drained of energy, how

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.610 align:middle line:90%
does your body tell you?

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.475 align:middle line:84%
So you have to know
those two things first.

00:56:13.475 --> 00:56:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to teach you the two

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:18.240 align:middle line:90%
steps to making good decisions.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So I call it the
decision filter test.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Step one is knowing
what you value.

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:24.490 align:middle line:90%
I value people.

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I value healing, health
and communication, love

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:29.250 align:middle line:90%
and connection.

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Those are all really,
really important to me.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So if I know what I value,
then all I need to know

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:40.397 align:middle line:84%
is step two, which is what gives
me energy and what drains me

00:56:40.397 --> 00:56:42.160 align:middle line:90%
of energy?

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So an exercise where
you can do this

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:49.320 align:middle line:84%
is to actually spend the next
seven days, the next week,

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:50.840 align:middle line:90%
just paying attention.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:54.990 align:middle line:84%
What interactions, situations,
conversations give you energy,

00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:57.110 align:middle line:90%
and which ones drain you?

00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And then the part on values.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.215 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do is,
if you don't know right

00:57:02.215 --> 00:57:05.250 align:middle line:84%
off the top of your head-- most
people don't know what they

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:07.630 align:middle line:84%
value, what you do
is think of someone

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:11.460 align:middle line:84%
you really admire,
someone in the world

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:15.120 align:middle line:90%
who seems to have what you want.

00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And pay attention to what
it is you value about them.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.184 align:middle line:84%
Write those three
to five things down.

00:57:23.184 --> 00:57:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I want
you to know, those

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:29.260 align:middle line:84%
are actually some of
what you value most.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So you're just going to put
those two things together.

00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
a decision that

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:34.310 align:middle line:84%
comes your way, ask
yourself, does it

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:37.100 align:middle line:90%
pass has my values filter test?

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I think of it like
a little filter.

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Does it pass my
values filter test?

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And if it does,
the second question

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:45.240 align:middle line:90%
is do I want to do this?

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And you know that if
it gives you energy.

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that the
values filter test

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.252 align:middle line:84%
will help making
decisions for you easier.

00:57:53.252 --> 00:57:54.085 align:middle line:90%
