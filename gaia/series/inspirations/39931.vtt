>> Lisa Garr: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of  Gaiam Inspirations .

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.516 align:middle line:84%
And today we are going
to go on a journey

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.619 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient Toltec
city of Teotihuacan,

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Mexico through the eyes

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.557 align:middle line:84%
of a documentary
called Dreaming Heaven .

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:26.293 align:middle line:84%
Teotihuacan is known as
the oldest mystery school

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:29.497 align:middle line:84%
in the western hemisphere
and its name translates

00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:31.732 align:middle line:90%
as "Where man becomes God."

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
My guest today Lee
McCormick documented 18 people

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.372 align:middle line:84%
through a mystical
journey to Teotihuacan,

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:39.974 align:middle line:84%
Mexico and followed
their stories

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
as they uncovered their
own pathways to discovered

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.514 align:middle line:84%
who they truly are at the
very core of their being.

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:48.849 align:middle line:84%
And this documentary
and the book is called

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Dreaming Heaven .

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.451 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Lee.

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:51.819 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:53.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Lee McCormick: Oh, thank you
Lisa, it's great to be here.

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:55.489 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What -- what a
journey that you've been

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.925 align:middle line:84%
through in your own life
and taking people on.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.928 align:middle line:84%
What inspired you to do this,
to take people on these types

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:90%
of journeys in the first place?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It was just
a natural transition.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.539 align:middle line:84%
In my life, early on when I
got into recovery, I was --

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.409 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for
something that was missing.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.977 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like there --

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.312 align:middle line:90%
there was for me something

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:20.848 align:middle line:84%
that just didn't feel
right about my life.

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:22.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What happened
before recovery?

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
How did you get there
in the first place?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.156 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Oh
God, that's a...

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's a long story...

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:31.225 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: ...yeah, it's a...

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:32.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ...we've got time.

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:33.928 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...it's
a long story.

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:37.531 align:middle line:84%
You know, part of it came
about as a result of --

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.433 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of years
in the music business

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.068 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of time on the road.

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:44.071 align:middle line:84%
And you know, just
going from place

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.373 align:middle line:90%
to place partying all the time.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:52.947 align:middle line:84%
And that and the deeper
aspect of that is really,

00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:58.718 align:middle line:84%
I believe today, it's
the result of how --

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:02.723 align:middle line:84%
of how we go through life
trying to figure out who we are

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:04.658 align:middle line:84%
and what we're really
doing here.

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:08.528 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the way that
we either adopt or adapt

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:14.201 align:middle line:84%
to an identity or not -- and
I was born into a big family.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:16.836 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: A big ole
southern family, it was a --

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:84%
it was a pretty powerful family
in the area that we lived in.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.043 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there
was a lot of "supposed

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:26.814 align:middle line:90%
to be's" in that setup.

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:31.385 align:middle line:84%
And I never really fit in,
not in my own skin anyway.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.654 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like
I really fit in.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In what way?

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:41.028 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I felt like I just
never did quite measure up like,

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:44.732 align:middle line:84%
the men were men, you know,
big powerful, characters

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:49.436 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not a little guy, but
personality wise, I just --

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:52.139 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ever really feel
like I was man enough

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.475 align:middle line:84%
or I was bad enough
or I was something.

00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was
something missing.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:01.582 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And growing up
in the, you know in the '60's

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:06.987 align:middle line:84%
and '70's, you know, like I told
people, that was before drugs

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:10.891 align:middle line:90%
and alcohol were bad for you.

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: [Laughter].

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:13.761 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You know,
so the tendency to party

00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:15.896 align:middle line:84%
and especially being in the
music business, it all just kind

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.631 align:middle line:84%
of came together
into a perfect storm.

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:18.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's the culture.

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:19.366 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.768 align:middle line:90%
It's the culture.

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:24.271 align:middle line:84%
And those behaviors that were
a lot of fun and were just kind

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
of part of the scene in the
'70's and the early '80's,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.846 align:middle line:84%
those behaviors didn't
necessarily change

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.115 align:middle line:90%
as life moved on, you know.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:41.622 align:middle line:84%
And, so I ended up needing to --
I needed to deal with the mess

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:43.424 align:middle line:84%
that I was making of
myself later on in life.

00:03:43.424 --> 00:03:46.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How long did that
last for -- the partying years,

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:47.961 align:middle line:90%
the rock and roll years?

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:48.996 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Probably 20 years.

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: 20 years.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.931 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:52.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, at what point
did you know it was more

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.102 align:middle line:84%
than just recreational, it
was more than your -- your --

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
the culture of the
music business?

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.206 align:middle line:84%
At what point did you
know it was a problem?

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:02.676 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You know
honestly, probably half

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:04.311 align:middle line:90%
that time I had no clue.

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:08.549 align:middle line:84%
I just -- I was just
kind of wide open.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.352 align:middle line:84%
And then it -- it
was like, okay --

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:16.389 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually really get
it, that I didn't have a lot

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.526 align:middle line:84%
of choice in how I would respond
to situations until the last two

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:23.831 align:middle line:84%
or three years before
I went to treatment --

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.033 align:middle line:84%
before I checked myself
into a treatment center.

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's important.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.336 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't have a choice in
how you'd respond to situations

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
because the substances
were responding for you?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.475 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
I mean basically,

00:04:34.475 --> 00:04:37.144 align:middle line:84%
I would have the same
range of reactions.

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:39.713 align:middle line:84%
Like on a good day -- by the
time I went to treatment,

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:41.515 align:middle line:90%
I was out of the music scene.

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:90%
I was in the ranching business.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I traded commodities, I was
living in a whole other world,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.091 align:middle line:84%
but my reaction to a good
day was, "Let's go party."

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And my reaction to a bad
day was, "Let's go party."

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:55.429 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: So I realized

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:57.998 align:middle line:84%
that I had the same
response pretty much

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:01.068 align:middle line:90%
to everything that was going on.

00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:05.439 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when I got
to a place to where it --

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.676 align:middle line:84%
it was just a nightmare
being stuck in that loop,

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and so I did, I checked myself
into a treatment center.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.584 align:middle line:84%
And that really opened my
eyes to a whole other aspect

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:24.258 align:middle line:84%
to being human, that I really
just had no awareness of.

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:27.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, most people
don't just check themselves in.

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:34.034 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a crisis moment
or a wakeup call or anything

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:35.903 align:middle line:90%
that got you to that point?

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:38.405 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: There was a girl,
you know, a woman that I was

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:39.573 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship with.

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:45.279 align:middle line:84%
And she was -- we were
pretty crazy together,

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:53.821 align:middle line:84%
but her dad had been in AA and
she said to me at one point,

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:55.322 align:middle line:84%
"You know, you got a
problem with this."

00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:57.057 align:middle line:90%
Alcohol was not my issue.

00:05:57.057 --> 00:05:58.625 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't my thing.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:04.231 align:middle line:84%
But she said, "You can't stop
when you get going and you ought

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:05.933 align:middle line:84%
to go to a therapist
or you ought to go

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:06.767 align:middle line:90%
to a meeting or something."

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:07.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:08.936 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: And I had no clue.

00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:11.171 align:middle line:84%
You know, I guess I had
known some people that were

00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:13.841 align:middle line:84%
in a 12-step program, but
I'd never really given it

00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:15.676 align:middle line:90%
any thought.

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.778 align:middle line:84%
And so I went and
found a therapist

00:06:17.778 --> 00:06:21.148 align:middle line:84%
and connected with
this therapist.

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:24.318 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
interesting, you know.

00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I had never done anything
like that before either

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.424 align:middle line:84%
and I was 40 years
old at the time, so.

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:32.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I mean, a lot of people
-- I'm listening right now --

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.028 align:middle line:84%
are identifying with
your story that get --

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.763 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they're
getting a wakeup call

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:40.067 align:middle line:84%
from even this interview
-- to have that moment.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:44.404 align:middle line:84%
So when you got into treatment,
did you think this -- this is --

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.774 align:middle line:84%
this is the place for
me, or did you resist it?

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:51.578 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: No, I was
really accepting of it.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:55.382 align:middle line:84%
The power of the community
that existed in that program

00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:59.219 align:middle line:84%
that I was in was so
powerful and, you know,

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.155 align:middle line:84%
what was really compelling
and overwhelming

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:06.994 align:middle line:84%
to me was all the trauma
and the depth of heartbreak

00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:10.797 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences that the
people that I was in treatment

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:13.934 align:middle line:84%
with -- there were
60 something people

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.904 align:middle line:90%
in that program at that time.

00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And you know I've never
heard stories like that.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I had never openly had
conversations with people

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.014 align:middle line:84%
who had been sexually
abused as children or women

00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
that had been raped talking
about the experiences.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.519 align:middle line:84%
And men that had been
sexually abused and it's

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:35.989 align:middle line:84%
like the whole dark side
of humanity is really

00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:38.458 align:middle line:84%
in our culture --
it's kept kind of --

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.294 align:middle line:90%
it's kept under the surface.

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:41.562 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't
really go there;

00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:44.164 align:middle line:84%
it'll get some
sensationalized...

00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:45.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Charity methods, yeah.

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.334 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: ...yeah.

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, you hear about it
from time to time, but it's --

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.073 align:middle line:84%
culturally, we don't
really sit down and talk

00:07:53.073 --> 00:07:57.477 align:middle line:84%
about the dirty laundry in our
families and in this culture.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.846 align:middle line:84%
And consequently,
it just gets passed

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.782 align:middle line:84%
on from generation
to generation.

00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:04.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So what made you
decide that this was something

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.153 align:middle line:90%
that you wanted to carry on?

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.155 align:middle line:84%
So you went through the
recovery and you went

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:12.192 align:middle line:84%
through the program -- at what
point did you realize you come

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:16.096 align:middle line:84%
now to date, you own two
massive recovery centers.

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:17.864 align:middle line:90%
One is in Malibu.

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.232 align:middle line:90%
One is in Tennessee.

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.667 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Well, yeah.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.768 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I don't --

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:23.437 align:middle line:84%
I'm no longer a part
of the one in Malibu.

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:24.671 align:middle line:90%
I sold out of it.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I've started four different
treatment programs...

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Four different...

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:28.742 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: ...over the years.

00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:31.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So when you got there,
what was it that just turned

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:34.348 align:middle line:90%
that aha moment on for you?

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:35.582 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Just the depth

00:08:35.582 --> 00:08:38.085 align:middle line:84%
of what we really
are as human beings.

00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:42.155 align:middle line:84%
And the realization that I
had, actually in treatment,

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that there is an entire other
side to life and to the truth

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.498 align:middle line:84%
of what we are really, that
we don't necessarily have any

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:55.135 align:middle line:84%
conscious awareness of
or conscious relationship

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:59.106 align:middle line:84%
to in the day-to-day life
that we live in our culture.

00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So, creation and life and
being a human being is

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.948 align:middle line:84%
such a big experience
and there's so --

00:09:07.948 --> 00:09:10.083 align:middle line:84%
there's so much going
on all the time,

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:13.453 align:middle line:84%
and yet our attention
has been trained to be

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:17.224 align:middle line:84%
so narrowly focused on the
task at hand, you know.

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:20.127 align:middle line:84%
And our identity is really
drawn from the stories

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:22.596 align:middle line:84%
that we tell ourself
and from the stories

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:26.633 align:middle line:84%
that we inherit being born
into the legacy of our family

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.402 align:middle line:90%
and the legacy of our culture.

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:31.004 align:middle line:90%
That you know, it's pretty rare

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that someone will
really investigate

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.779 align:middle line:84%
or go beyond the way life
is characterized for you.

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:41.782 align:middle line:84%
So we live this role
that we're born into.

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:43.884 align:middle line:84%
And we live the legacy
that we're born into.

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:47.154 align:middle line:84%
And we adopt and adapt and you
know, you let some things go

00:09:47.154 --> 00:09:48.622 align:middle line:90%
and bring in some other things.

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's all happening
pretty much

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.027 align:middle line:84%
within a fairly narrow
bandwidth of consciousness.

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:59.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And then -- and then
enter in conflict and tragedy

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:03.804 align:middle line:84%
and violation and loss, and it
doesn't give you those tools

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:05.272 align:middle line:84%
to deal with those,
life doesn't.

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: No not really,
in our culture, you know,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:90%
the way to fix anything is more

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of something else
pretty much, you know.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.083 align:middle line:84%
And that was certainly
my response.

00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:18.351 align:middle line:84%
You know, more money
will make it better.

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:19.553 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: A bigger
house will make it better.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.422 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Another
relationship,

00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:25.759 align:middle line:84%
different clothes -- it's
all externally driven.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:29.596 align:middle line:84%
And the issues that
we're really suffering

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:32.332 align:middle line:84%
from are all heart
and soul issues.

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:34.167 align:middle line:90%
They're not external issues.

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:35.435 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
about our connection

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:37.971 align:middle line:90%
and relationship to ourself.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But let's take a
look here at the trailer

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
for the movie,  Dreaming Heaven
and see what it's all about.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.379 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:54.454 align:middle line:90%
[ Movie Playing ]

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:05.078 align:middle line:84%
Now what is the difference
in your approach to recovery?

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And I notice that these
people that are going

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.084 align:middle line:84%
through this aren't all
in substance situations

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that they're recovering from,
illnesses or all sorts of things

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.055 align:middle line:90%
in life, is that right?

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:16.089 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah, the people

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:18.358 align:middle line:84%
in the film are just
people living life

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:21.795 align:middle line:90%
and you know, not unlike I was.

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:24.064 align:middle line:84%
They're all people who are
looking for something more.

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:26.433 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, there's --
they have an interest either

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:32.339 align:middle line:84%
in the esoteric wisdom of the
Toltec tradition or they're

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:90%
in some transition in life

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:36.776 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
trying to get clarity.

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:39.212 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to work their
way through their stuff,

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.613 align:middle line:90%
whatever that might be.

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:45.251 align:middle line:84%
And it really -- it's
really not tied to recovery

00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:48.054 align:middle line:84%
as such formally, it just
turns out that a lot of people

00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that are in recovery
continue to ask a lot

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.692 align:middle line:90%
of questions about life.

00:14:52.692 --> 00:14:54.861 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So there's a gap there

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:58.198 align:middle line:84%
of when you finished your
recovery program and then

00:14:58.198 --> 00:15:00.667 align:middle line:84%
when you started taking
people on these journeys.

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:04.771 align:middle line:84%
What did you find in recovery
that inspired you to --

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:09.142 align:middle line:84%
to take this on, to become
the teacher, to change it

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:12.579 align:middle line:84%
from the traditional recovery
model to something more

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.081 align:middle line:84%
of the shamanistic
recovery model?

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.183 align:middle line:90%
Not that there is one, but...

00:15:17.183 --> 00:15:19.753 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.922 align:middle line:84%
You know, the structure
of recovery and the story

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:29.295 align:middle line:84%
of being a person in recovery
sounded to me like another role.

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:31.464 align:middle line:84%
Like, okay my name's
Lee, I'm an addict...

00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:32.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:33.299 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...I
need to go to meetings;

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:34.734 align:middle line:90%
I need to get a sponsor...

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:35.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I'm always --

00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:37.303 align:middle line:84%
always going to be
identified as an addict.

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:38.805 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...yeah, my
name's Lee and I'm an addict.

00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:41.775 align:middle line:84%
But when we say my
name is and I am --

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:45.111 align:middle line:84%
we're taking on that
role and that identity.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.415 align:middle line:84%
And that never felt
correct to me --

00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:50.917 align:middle line:84%
is the only way I
know how to say it.

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It never felt like that
was actually the truth.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.922 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I am.

00:15:55.922 --> 00:15:59.125 align:middle line:84%
I clearly had an addiction,
now there was no confusion

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:03.129 align:middle line:84%
about that, but that
addiction did not define me.

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:07.934 align:middle line:84%
And so it just wasn't
comfortable, you know, the --

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:09.869 align:middle line:84%
that labeling was never
comfortable for me.

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:12.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So begs the question
though, what does define you?

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:14.808 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:18.144 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, that's
where the shamanic world comes

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.779 align:middle line:84%
in with the point of
view of, "You know what,

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:21.281 align:middle line:84%
we don't really know
what we are.

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:27.554 align:middle line:84%
We know what we believe, we know
the identities and the roles

00:16:27.554 --> 00:16:31.024 align:middle line:84%
that we have lived and
we're not those roles.

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:32.325 align:middle line:90%
And we're not those identities."

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Those things all change.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.894 align:middle line:90%
They come and they go.

00:16:34.894 --> 00:16:36.262 align:middle line:90%
But what are we really?

00:16:36.262 --> 00:16:39.365 align:middle line:84%
We're the consciousness
that's embodied in this form

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:43.369 align:middle line:84%
as a human being and that
consciousness is greater

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:48.475 align:middle line:84%
than any definition or any
particular specific role

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:52.512 align:middle line:84%
that you want to take on during
the course of a lifetime.

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:56.015 align:middle line:84%
So there's an aspect
of mystery to life

00:16:56.015 --> 00:17:01.121 align:middle line:84%
and to being a human that's just
inherent and our being here.

00:17:01.121 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So people -- taking
people on these journeys though,

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.394 align:middle line:84%
is -- is probably one of
the best ways to discover

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that who you are
rather than staying

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
with the regular day-to-day
life and the routine of life.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.104 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well it is if it
-- if it resonates with you.

00:17:18.104 --> 00:17:19.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:21.508 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You know, if it
calls your name, then yeah.

00:17:21.508 --> 00:17:25.611 align:middle line:84%
You know, and we're all unique,
every human being is unique.

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:28.748 align:middle line:84%
There is no one way to
accomplish something.

00:17:28.748 --> 00:17:33.219 align:middle line:84%
It happened that -- that
the books of Don Miguel Ruiz

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.421 align:middle line:84%
and Carlos Castaneda
and you know,

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.991 align:middle line:84%
the mystery school
shamanically oriented books,

00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:42.662 align:middle line:84%
the Native American books of
Black Elk  and  Fools Crow ,

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:45.331 align:middle line:84%
all of that material
really resonated with me.

00:17:45.331 --> 00:17:50.103 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I chose to pursue
that because my situation

00:17:50.103 --> 00:17:52.472 align:middle line:84%
in recovery was,
"Okay, who am I really?

00:17:52.472 --> 00:17:54.374 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing in this world

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:58.378 align:middle line:84%
and why does life
feel like it feels?"

00:17:58.378 --> 00:17:59.812 align:middle line:90%
There was something missing.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So you did know that?

00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:02.482 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh, yeah.

00:18:02.482 --> 00:18:05.084 align:middle line:84%
No, I knew something was
missing and when I would ask --

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:84%
like, if I went to my
therapist and I said,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.555 align:middle line:90%
"You know, something's missing."

00:18:08.555 --> 00:18:11.457 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I had a really cool
therapist and he said, "Man."

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:12.592 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You're
not going to find it

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.928 align:middle line:90%
in the rooms of AA or NA."

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:18.164 align:middle line:84%
He said, "What you're talking
about is like the question

00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:20.567 align:middle line:84%
of life and you're going
to have to get out there

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:22.068 align:middle line:90%
and find it for yourself."

00:18:22.068 --> 00:18:24.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So why did you
migrate towards Teotihuacan,

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.507 align:middle line:90%
Mexico and the Nagual's there?

00:18:27.507 --> 00:18:28.341 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: The Nawal's?

00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:29.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Nawal's.

00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:31.744 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
you know, it just --

00:18:31.744 --> 00:18:32.946 align:middle line:90%
when I read Miguel's book,

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:36.082 align:middle line:84%
The Four Agreements ,
it resonated with me.

00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:38.985 align:middle line:84%
And it was so simple
and so profound --

00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:42.856 align:middle line:84%
and I was in a space of
anything that came along

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:45.592 align:middle line:84%
that was intriguing to
me or that I got a hit --

00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:48.661 align:middle line:84%
you know, if I read a book,
because I read a lot of books.

00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the mid '90's

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.299 align:middle line:84%
when we had bookstores
everywhere, you know.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:90%
I read a lot of books

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and if something resonated
then I would pursue it.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.106 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd find the next
book or I'd check it out and see

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:02.041 align:middle line:84%
if they did workshops
or whatever.

00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:03.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:06.913 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So after I read
The Four Agreements , I was --

00:19:06.913 --> 00:19:09.549 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to find out
what else might be going on

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:12.552 align:middle line:84%
and I found that
they led trips to --

00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:15.788 align:middle line:84%
that they, the teachers
who Miguel had trained

00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:19.192 align:middle line:84%
over the years, were leading
journeys to Teotihuacan,

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:22.128 align:middle line:84%
so I just signed up for
a journey and got a plane

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:23.296 align:middle line:90%
and flew to Mexico City.

00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know anybody.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And that was
the beginning for you.

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:25.932 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:19:25.932 --> 00:19:26.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.401 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So then you decided

00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
to start your own
types of journeys.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.773 align:middle line:84%
About how long after that
did you decide to start that?

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:35.908 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well,
the tradition is

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that as you live these
experiences with your teachers,

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.082 align:middle line:84%
at a point the teachers
will say to you,

00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:45.451 align:middle line:84%
"It's time that you
start teaching."

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's kind
of that push.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.355 align:middle line:84%
Like, okay it's time
for you because --

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:51.724 align:middle line:84%
you know what we do
inevitably is we'll be

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:52.959 align:middle line:90%
in a practice for a while.

00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:54.227 align:middle line:84%
They can be any kid
of practice --

00:19:54.227 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism or carpentry
or art, anything.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And if we stay under the
umbrella in the security

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.369 align:middle line:84%
of our teachers, we start
thinking we've got it all

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:05.672 align:middle line:84%
figured out because we
have this security blanket.

00:20:05.672 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:90%
And in the Shamanic traditions,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.409 align:middle line:84%
the teachers have
that awareness.

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:12.445 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to push you
out of the nest and make you get

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:13.646 align:middle line:90%
out there on your own.

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:15.748 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize you
really don't know anything

00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:18.685 align:middle line:84%
because you're now responsible
for leading and coming

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:21.888 align:middle line:84%
up the answers for
a group of people.

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:27.327 align:middle line:84%
So it was probably three years
into my continuously working

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:30.463 align:middle line:84%
with my teachers that
I started working

00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:34.233 align:middle line:84%
with more experienced teachers,
but I was kind of tagging along,

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:37.437 align:middle line:84%
trying to find a way
to be a part of that.

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:39.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And how did you find
the  The Dreaming House ,

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:41.708 align:middle line:90%
the place that you found there?

00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:43.676 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well,  The
Dreaming House  didn't exist

00:20:43.676 --> 00:20:45.678 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
going to Teotihuacan.

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:50.917 align:middle line:84%
I got to be good friends
with Alberto Hernandez

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:54.253 align:middle line:84%
and his wife Veronica who live
in the Pueblo at the south end

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.823 align:middle line:84%
of the Ancient City
of Teotihuacan.

00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:58.524 align:middle line:90%
They live in San Sebastian.

00:20:58.524 --> 00:21:02.829 align:middle line:84%
And Alberto and I were just
like lost brothers, you know,

00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:05.598 align:middle line:90%
we just -- just got along great.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:09.736 align:middle line:84%
And he would take me to his
house for supper and you know,

00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:11.637 align:middle line:84%
he would invite me
to come to fiestas

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:14.807 align:middle line:84%
and different villages
when I was in Mexico.

00:21:14.807 --> 00:21:16.876 align:middle line:84%
And I just fell in
love with Mexico.

00:21:16.876 --> 00:21:19.612 align:middle line:90%
I love Mexico.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.315 align:middle line:84%
And so I -- Alberto
had an old house

00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:26.119 align:middle line:84%
that had been his grandmother's
and I said look if --

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:90%
nobody was living in it.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.055 align:middle line:84%
It was abandoned, it
was over 100 years old.

00:21:29.055 --> 00:21:31.924 align:middle line:90%
It was a little Adobe house.

00:21:31.924 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Alberto, if I
could send you the money,

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.532 align:middle line:84%
could we fix this house up
so I have a place to stay

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:41.567 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to
stay in the hotel?"

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:43.136 align:middle line:90%
Because I knew I was going

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:46.806 align:middle line:84%
to have a long-term
relationship with Teotihuacan.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.775 align:middle line:90%
So we started that.

00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:52.678 align:middle line:84%
You know, being -- I was
like the Gringo Mexicano guy

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:55.314 align:middle line:84%
who every month I sent
money home, you know.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.316 align:middle line:84%
And Alberto started
working on the house

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:00.286 align:middle line:84%
and over eight years
it turned into a,

00:22:00.286 --> 00:22:01.921 align:middle line:90%
like a 30 room boutique hotel.

00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:02.789 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh my goodness!

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:03.489 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: So once it...

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: More than...

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.158 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...yeah,
once it got up to...

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:06.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow!

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.427 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...four
or five rooms,

00:22:07.427 --> 00:22:09.662 align:middle line:84%
because I started taking
groups and we would stay there

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:13.032 align:middle line:84%
and we just kept feeding all the
money back into expanding it.

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:15.435 align:middle line:84%
And  The Dreaming
House  is amazing.

00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:16.803 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:22:16.803 --> 00:22:19.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's literally a dream
house and a dreaming house.

00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:20.339 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It is.

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Let's take a
look at some of the people

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.342 align:middle line:90%
in this journey that went --

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.311 align:middle line:84%
went into the movie
Dreaming Heaven .

00:22:25.311 --> 00:22:26.312 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:22:26.312 --> 00:22:35.388 align:middle line:90%
[ Movie Trailer ]

00:24:34.006 --> 00:24:36.943 align:middle line:84%
Does -- does the word Dreaming
Heaven have a significant

00:24:36.943 --> 00:24:40.479 align:middle line:90%
meaning in Teotihuacan?

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:42.248 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I don't know
that it does necessarily

00:24:42.248 --> 00:24:46.485 align:middle line:84%
in the legacy or the mystery
school of Teotihuacan,

00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:50.223 align:middle line:84%
but you know,  Dreaming
Heaven  came about really

00:24:50.223 --> 00:24:55.094 align:middle line:84%
through conversations between
Frank Hayhurst and Gini Gentry

00:24:55.094 --> 00:24:58.898 align:middle line:84%
and myself around the
work that we were doing

00:24:58.898 --> 00:25:04.704 align:middle line:84%
because from the Toltec mystery
school perspective, what we live

00:25:04.704 --> 00:25:07.506 align:middle line:84%
as individual human beings
is literally a dream.

00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:10.776 align:middle line:84%
We're each dreaming
our own unique version

00:25:10.776 --> 00:25:15.214 align:middle line:84%
of reality meaning that, we
each hold a unique perspective

00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:16.048 align:middle line:90%
on life.

00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:18.451 align:middle line:90%
We each have unique experiences.

00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:20.886 align:middle line:90%
We have unique belief systems.

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:26.092 align:middle line:84%
We have unique frames
of reference of belief

00:25:26.092 --> 00:25:28.027 align:middle line:90%
and ideas and creativity.

00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:33.466 align:middle line:84%
So, the way that we hold
our dream and the quality

00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:37.103 align:middle line:84%
and the context of our
individual reality is based

00:25:37.103 --> 00:25:40.006 align:middle line:90%
on largely what we inherited.

00:25:40.006 --> 00:25:42.808 align:middle line:84%
So the foundation of our
belief system, the foundation

00:25:42.808 --> 00:25:47.313 align:middle line:84%
of our reality, the foundation
of the way we move energetically

00:25:47.313 --> 00:25:50.549 align:middle line:84%
and how we live is based
on our inherited culture

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.686 align:middle line:84%
and our inherited personal
legacy from our family,

00:25:53.686 --> 00:25:56.288 align:middle line:90%
our religions, our schools.

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:58.357 align:middle line:90%
And that dream, that reality,

00:25:58.357 --> 00:26:01.794 align:middle line:84%
is largely today
characterized by fear.

00:26:01.794 --> 00:26:05.798 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that, you know, we do
things because we need security

00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:08.834 align:middle line:84%
and we do things because
we need to be safe.

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:12.338 align:middle line:84%
And we need to save
money for the future

00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:13.439 align:middle line:90%
in case something goes wrong.

00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:17.276 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of
messages like that.

00:26:17.276 --> 00:26:21.781 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, we're
taught that we need to live

00:26:21.781 --> 00:26:23.883 align:middle line:84%
up to a lot of external
expectations.

00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:27.253 align:middle line:84%
Like, we should make As
instead of Bs and we need to go

00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.855 align:middle line:84%
to this school and we need
to marry the right person.

00:26:29.855 --> 00:26:35.094 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole context of
things that we need to do

00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:37.463 align:middle line:84%
if we want to be good
enough basically.

00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:38.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: With outside rewards,

00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:39.632 align:middle line:90%
with external rewards.

00:26:39.632 --> 00:26:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
it's all based

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.871 align:middle line:84%
in an outside-in
relationship to life.

00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:49.675 align:middle line:90%
And that relationship requires

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:54.213 align:middle line:84%
that we pretty much abandon
faith in ourself for the sake

00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of faith in the beliefs that
we've inherited and the rules

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.219 align:middle line:90%
of the world or the culture.

00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:03.255 align:middle line:84%
So when we abandon
faith in ourself,

00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:06.959 align:middle line:84%
from that point forward, we're
basically living life trying

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.728 align:middle line:84%
to fit in and trying
to be good enough

00:27:08.728 --> 00:27:09.895 align:middle line:90%
and it's based in judgment.

00:27:09.895 --> 00:27:11.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And seeking
approval from outside...

00:27:11.831 --> 00:27:12.865 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Exactly.

00:27:12.865 --> 00:27:14.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...which
is a endless tunnel.

00:27:14.734 --> 00:27:16.135 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Which we
see characterized all

00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:84%
through the culture
of this country today.

security, you know,

00:36:09.201 --> 00:36:10.702 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It's just
having faith in it.

00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:18.143 align:middle line:84%
I have faith that life
is of this great mystery

00:36:18.143 --> 00:36:19.678 align:middle line:84%
and that the presence
behind it --

00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:22.047 align:middle line:84%
because our lives
are very finite.

00:36:22.047 --> 00:36:26.018 align:middle line:84%
We're only here for a moment,
but we're not our bodies,

00:36:26.018 --> 00:36:29.955 align:middle line:84%
and we're not limited to the
experience of this time frame

00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:31.923 align:middle line:90%
in this body, as this identity.

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
We're the consciousness,
we're the spirit that dwells

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.129 align:middle line:84%
in the body and that
animates the form,

00:36:37.129 --> 00:36:41.934 align:middle line:84%
and our spirit is eternal,
by my experience, and my,

00:36:41.934 --> 00:36:43.735 align:middle line:90%
I guess I could say, belief,

00:36:43.735 --> 00:36:45.637 align:middle line:84%
and my belief is
based in experience.

00:36:45.637 --> 00:36:50.008 align:middle line:84%
So, we're not limited
to life in this body.

00:36:50.008 --> 00:36:53.478 align:middle line:84%
As our consciousness leaves
the form, the body is dead.

00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:57.516 align:middle line:84%
It becomes inanimate, but
the consciousness lives on.

00:36:57.516 --> 00:36:58.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:36:58.216 --> 00:36:59.618 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: You know?

00:36:59.618 --> 00:37:00.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:02.788 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: So, it's
having faith in the mystery,

00:37:02.788 --> 00:37:04.523 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to faith
in the belief system,

00:37:04.523 --> 00:37:06.525 align:middle line:84%
because belief systems
are created by people.

00:37:06.525 --> 00:37:08.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Faith in the
mystery, as you just said,

00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:09.494 align:middle line:90%
our consciousness lives on.

00:37:09.494 --> 00:37:10.162 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:10.162 --> 00:37:11.396 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:13.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, the transformations
that the people make

00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:17.769 align:middle line:84%
in these experiences,
do they last?

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:22.541 align:middle line:84%
Do they go on back to their
regular jobs, their lives,

00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:24.943 align:middle line:84%
and bring these teachings
forward?

00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:28.547 align:middle line:84%
I know that one happened to have
been a civil rights activist.

00:37:28.547 --> 00:37:29.247 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Mm-hmm.

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:30.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:37:30.382 --> 00:37:31.817 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You know,
the journeys shift us,

00:37:31.817 --> 00:37:36.121 align:middle line:84%
because once -- as an adult,
once you've had the experience

00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:42.227 align:middle line:84%
of the expansive side of
yourself, as a human being,

00:37:42.227 --> 00:37:46.098 align:middle line:84%
once you've had that experience,
you never forget it again.

00:37:46.098 --> 00:37:46.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm-hmm.

00:37:46.865 --> 00:37:47.432 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: You know...

00:37:47.432 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.068 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...it's kind of
like, in the recovery world,

00:37:50.068 --> 00:37:51.703 align:middle line:84%
once you've gone to treatment
and you've really woken

00:37:51.703 --> 00:37:53.105 align:middle line:90%
up to the fact that, "oh my God,

00:37:53.105 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm really the one
doing this to me."

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.545 align:middle line:84%
Once you wake up to the
nature of cause and effect...

00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:01.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:02.447 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...in
your relationships,

00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:03.014 align:middle line:90%
you can't play dumb again.

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:04.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:06.218 align:middle line:84%
Even without accountability
partners, and all that?

00:38:06.218 --> 00:38:06.852 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:06.852 --> 00:38:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: No.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.321 align:middle line:84%
You might -- you might go
back out and use or drink,

00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:11.490 align:middle line:84%
or decide to just continue
to live that way again,

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.759 align:middle line:90%
but that's a conscious choice.

00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:15.494 align:middle line:84%
You don't ever forget
what you know.

00:38:15.494 --> 00:38:19.464 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you have this
life altering, expansive,...

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:20.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm-hmm.

00:38:20.499 --> 00:38:21.299 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...spiritual
experience,

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:23.468 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that.

00:38:23.468 --> 00:38:24.603 align:middle line:90%
You don't ever forget it,

00:38:24.603 --> 00:38:28.707 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people are
deeply inspired by that,

00:38:28.707 --> 00:38:30.175 align:middle line:84%
and they'll continue
to pursue it.

00:38:30.175 --> 00:38:32.477 align:middle line:84%
Some people just, kind
of, chalk it up as,

00:38:32.477 --> 00:38:33.845 align:middle line:90%
okay, well, that was cool.

00:38:33.845 --> 00:38:37.182 align:middle line:84%
That was interesting and,
you know, they choo --

00:38:37.182 --> 00:38:40.018 align:middle line:84%
they won't pursue it,
but that's free will.

00:38:40.018 --> 00:38:42.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How many of
these have you led?

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:44.122 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh gosh.

00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:45.724 align:middle line:90%
Over the last 15 years,...

00:38:45.724 --> 00:38:46.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: 15.

00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:49.828 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...probably
40 or 50 trips.

00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:52.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Any one particular
stand out in your mind,

00:38:52.597 --> 00:38:56.701 align:middle line:84%
or where there was a significant
change, or have you kept

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.103 align:middle line:84%
in touch with many
of these people?

00:38:58.103 --> 00:38:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh, yeah.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:59.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:38:59.538 --> 00:39:00.605 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:39:00.605 --> 00:39:02.374 align:middle line:84%
It, you know, we kind
of become a tribe.

00:39:02.374 --> 00:39:03.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:04.843 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: We used to
joke about it, you know,

00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:07.779 align:middle line:84%
we called it the cult for a
while, but it's actually --

00:39:07.779 --> 00:39:10.782 align:middle line:84%
the cool think about
the Toltec work is that,

00:39:10.782 --> 00:39:12.584 align:middle line:84%
it's not a come drink
the Kool-Aid

00:39:12.584 --> 00:39:14.319 align:middle line:90%
and join our belief system.

00:39:14.319 --> 00:39:17.789 align:middle line:84%
The focus of this is on each
individual's authenticity

00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:22.427 align:middle line:84%
and unique interpretation of
life, and the way that each

00:39:22.427 --> 00:39:26.498 align:middle line:84%
of us choose to live and
create the life that we create.

00:39:26.498 --> 00:39:28.333 align:middle line:90%
So, it's very different

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:32.471 align:middle line:84%
from most belief
system based movements,

00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:37.008 align:middle line:84%
or gatherings, or
groups of people.

00:39:37.008 --> 00:39:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa:Mm-hmm.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.312 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You know, as
far as a particular journey

00:39:40.312 --> 00:39:42.714 align:middle line:84%
that stands out,
really, my first time

00:39:42.714 --> 00:39:47.219 align:middle line:84%
in Teotihuacan is probably
the most significant to me.

00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:49.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because
you -- because why?

00:39:49.788 --> 00:39:52.491 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, we met
in the Mexico City airport.

00:39:52.491 --> 00:39:53.859 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know anybody.

00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:57.629 align:middle line:84%
All I had done is read a book,
and then I took the action

00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:00.565 align:middle line:84%
to find these journeys,
and I signed up and went.

00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:90%
So, I didn't know anybody.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.001 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about what was coming.

00:40:03.001 --> 00:40:04.603 align:middle line:90%
I had no clue.

00:40:04.603 --> 00:40:08.373 align:middle line:84%
And we drove out to Teotihuacan,
about an hour from the airport,

00:40:08.373 --> 00:40:12.077 align:middle line:84%
and I got out of the van in the
parking lot of a little hotel,

00:40:12.077 --> 00:40:14.746 align:middle line:84%
and you could look straight
down the Avenue of the Dead,

00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:17.048 align:middle line:84%
where the pyramids
and the temples were.

00:40:17.048 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I stood there
looking down the Avenue,

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:22.687 align:middle line:84%
the whole place lit up like
it was 2000 years before.

00:40:22.687 --> 00:40:25.557 align:middle line:84%
Literally, it was
a total flashback

00:40:25.557 --> 00:40:26.791 align:middle line:90%
to another place and time.

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow!

00:40:28.126 --> 00:40:30.462 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And I've never
had that experience before.

00:40:30.462 --> 00:40:34.699 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened, it
was, my heart just exploded...

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:35.767 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Uh.

00:40:35.767 --> 00:40:36.501 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...and
I knew where I was,

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:37.802 align:middle line:90%
and I knew that place.

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:39.404 align:middle line:90%
It was a trip.

00:40:39.404 --> 00:40:41.606 align:middle line:90%
It was a profound experience.

00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:42.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Familiar?

00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:43.241 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Completely
familiar.

00:40:43.241 --> 00:40:45.076 align:middle line:90%
Instantly, I was home.

00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:46.144 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You had
been there before.

00:40:46.144 --> 00:40:46.711 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:40:46.711 --> 00:40:48.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Hmm.

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:51.716 align:middle line:84%
Had you talked to the other
shamans and Naguals, since then,

00:40:51.716 --> 00:40:53.251 align:middle line:90%
about that experience?

00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:54.586 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Well, it's funny.

00:40:54.586 --> 00:40:56.922 align:middle line:84%
The two people that were leading
that journey, the teachers

00:40:56.922 --> 00:41:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that led that journey, are some
of my best friends today, still.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.429 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that pushed
me out, at a point, and said,

00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:06.665 align:middle line:84%
"Okay, you need to
start teaching."

00:41:06.665 --> 00:41:09.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Yeah, because you have
been there before [laughter].

00:41:09.134 --> 00:41:10.335 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
well, they said,

00:41:10.335 --> 00:41:11.436 align:middle line:84%
"You need to start
teaching," because I had turned

00:41:11.436 --> 00:41:12.737 align:middle line:84%
into a pretty good
know-it-all...

00:41:12.737 --> 00:41:13.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: [Laughter].

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...you
know, and they wanted me

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.107 align:middle line:90%
to get spanked a little bit,...

00:41:16.107 --> 00:41:16.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, okay.

00:41:16.775 --> 00:41:17.976 align:middle line:90%
So that...

00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:19.077 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...which
is part of the tradition.

00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:20.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It was part
of the growth process.

00:41:20.145 --> 00:41:20.712 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:41:20.712 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah...

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.447 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: But they
also introduced me

00:41:22.447 --> 00:41:23.281 align:middle line:90%
to my wife later on.

00:41:23.281 --> 00:41:23.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh!

00:41:23.982 --> 00:41:24.950 align:middle line:90%
That's where you met...

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:25.517 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: That's
how I met Mee.

00:41:25.517 --> 00:41:26.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mee?

00:41:26.184 --> 00:41:27.319 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:41:27.319 --> 00:41:28.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Who's been on
our network and has --

00:41:28.153 --> 00:41:30.789 align:middle line:90%
and you have this amazing ranch

00:41:30.789 --> 00:41:32.057 align:middle line:84%
that she painted
this picture of.

00:41:32.057 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:84%
We saw a few pictures of
actually, in Tennessee together,

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.662 align:middle line:84%
where you have acres
and acres of land,

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:40.732 align:middle line:84%
and you've created your
own heaven on earth there.

00:41:40.732 --> 00:41:41.833 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:41:41.833 --> 00:41:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's been a
life-long dream of mine.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Was that
something that you created

00:41:47.939 --> 00:41:49.207 align:middle line:90%
through one of these journeys?

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:50.041 align:middle line:90%
Was that...

00:41:50.041 --> 00:41:50.609 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh, no.

00:41:50.609 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:90%
You know, the...

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:52.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...desire
to live like that?

00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:53.612 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...the ranch
was a part of the legacy

00:41:53.612 --> 00:41:54.713 align:middle line:90%
that I was born into,...

00:41:54.713 --> 00:41:55.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:41:55.547 --> 00:41:56.848 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: ...as a family.

00:41:56.848 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Not the land in Tennessee,
but I was born into a family

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:01.219 align:middle line:84%
that had been ranching in
Florida since the 1800s, and...

00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh!

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.754 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:42:02.754 --> 00:42:03.588 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...when
I was a kid,

00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:04.923 align:middle line:90%
my dad had a ranch in Wyoming.

00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:07.292 align:middle line:84%
So, I had grown up around
cattle and horses and, you know,

00:42:07.292 --> 00:42:09.828 align:middle line:84%
it was in my blood,
and I love it.

00:42:09.828 --> 00:42:14.032 align:middle line:84%
So, when I moved to
Tennessee, I ended up --

00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:16.201 align:middle line:84%
we ended up putting
together enough land

00:42:16.201 --> 00:42:17.502 align:middle line:90%
to start running some cows on,

00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:19.571 align:middle line:84%
and then I just grew
it from there.

00:42:19.571 --> 00:42:21.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And it's now a
fully sustainable farm

00:42:21.306 --> 00:42:23.675 align:middle line:84%
with community kitchens,
and what you've done

00:42:23.675 --> 00:42:25.176 align:middle line:84%
with it is absolutely
incredible.

00:42:25.176 --> 00:42:26.678 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah,
it's an amazing place.

00:42:26.678 --> 00:42:30.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, some of the
techniques and the meditations

00:42:30.148 --> 00:42:33.918 align:middle line:84%
that are taught in this
video are meditations

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:37.288 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually take
on, work with after the video,

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:39.457 align:middle line:84%
there's follow-up, there's
classes and so forth.

00:42:39.457 --> 00:42:42.560 align:middle line:84%
What's the follow-up to this
course by watching the film?

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, when you
-- "Dreaming Heaven" is a book,

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:50.068 align:middle line:84%
and when you purchase the book
you get a copy of the film,

00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:52.304 align:middle line:90%
in the back of the book,

00:42:52.304 --> 00:42:54.439 align:middle line:84%
or if you watch the
film, on  Gaiam ...

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Online.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.441 align:middle line:90%
Mm-mm.

00:42:56.441 --> 00:42:57.942 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...online, then
you can go purchase the book.

00:42:57.942 --> 00:43:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And the book is laid out in
the same format as the journey

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.648 align:middle line:90%
that you see on the film.

00:43:03.648 --> 00:43:09.087 align:middle line:84%
So, each chapter is a different
aspect of addressing our life,

00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:11.523 align:middle line:84%
and our reality, and
where we're at today.

00:43:11.523 --> 00:43:14.726 align:middle line:84%
And then the meditations
are congruent

00:43:14.726 --> 00:43:16.294 align:middle line:90%
with the chapters in the book.

00:43:16.294 --> 00:43:18.763 align:middle line:90%
So, literally, the package is --

00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:21.366 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like a
living art installation,

00:43:21.366 --> 00:43:23.068 align:middle line:90%
that when you buy this package,

00:43:23.068 --> 00:43:25.937 align:middle line:84%
you can go on that
journey yourself at home.

00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:26.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's beautiful!

00:43:26.705 --> 00:43:28.106 align:middle line:90%
That's a brilliant idea!

00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:31.009 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at some of the
guided meditations in the film.

00:43:31.009 --> 00:43:32.143 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:36.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Our journey ends at
the holiest of places;

00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:38.349 align:middle line:90%
the Pyramid of the Sun.

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:44.222 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:43:44.222 --> 00:43:48.593 align:middle line:84%
Deep beneath this
monument are ancient caves,

00:43:48.593 --> 00:43:52.630 align:middle line:84%
said to be the womb from which
the first humans emerged;

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:59.371 align:middle line:84%
the gate for the energetic
power of Teotihuacan.

>> The female goes in that
direction, and the male goes

00:44:13.051 --> 00:44:16.387 align:middle line:84%
in that direction, to
activate the double helix.

[ Music ]

00:45:00.598 --> 00:45:03.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Let your heart become
like an open channel.

00:45:03.535 --> 00:45:08.873 align:middle line:84%
You have been letting go of all
the structure, all those ideas

00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:13.611 align:middle line:84%
that you've had about the
way life and things are.

00:45:13.611 --> 00:45:20.385 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to bring back
in to our awareness the truth

00:45:20.385 --> 00:45:24.956 align:middle line:84%
that is within us, and open
your crown, and let the light

00:45:24.956 --> 00:45:27.458 align:middle line:84%
of the sun come right
down through you.

[ Music ]

00:45:38.002 --> 00:45:40.238 align:middle line:90%
We are the light.

00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:41.806 align:middle line:84%
[Background talking]
We are the wind.

00:45:41.806 --> 00:45:43.942 align:middle line:90%
We are the stone and the rain.

00:45:43.942 --> 00:45:47.879 align:middle line:90%
We are the sand and the ocean.

00:45:47.879 --> 00:45:50.448 align:middle line:84%
We are the colors
of the rainbow.

00:45:50.448 --> 00:45:51.816 align:middle line:90%
This is your dream now.

00:45:51.816 --> 00:45:55.253 align:middle line:90%
What has been is done.

00:45:55.253 --> 00:45:59.224 align:middle line:84%
This is the resurrection of your
own creation; the resurrection

00:45:59.224 --> 00:46:04.996 align:middle line:84%
of your divinity, the awakening
of the dream of heaven on earth.

00:46:04.996 --> 00:46:09.234 align:middle line:84%
Into your hands, creator,
I commend my spirit.

00:46:09.234 --> 00:46:11.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So, do people
do these groups --

00:46:11.603 --> 00:46:13.271 align:middle line:84%
do they stay connected
after this

00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and do their own meditation
groups, and so forth,

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.144 align:middle line:84%
after they see the film, or
after they go on these journeys?

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:20.812 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:46:20.812 --> 00:46:22.213 align:middle line:90%
Often times they do.

00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:25.116 align:middle line:84%
The people on the journeys will
stay in touch with each other...

00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:26.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:27.518 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...you know,
and a lot of people return,

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:30.188 align:middle line:84%
because as your life
evolves, the experience

00:46:30.188 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:90%
in Teotihuacan evolves.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.458 align:middle line:90%
It's a living place.

00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:35.460 align:middle line:90%
There's never two days the same.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.963 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this for
15 years, and every moment

00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:40.131 align:middle line:90%
on there is a fresh moment;

00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:41.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm.

00:46:41.332 --> 00:46:42.767 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: ...everything
is new all the time.

00:46:42.767 --> 00:46:47.405 align:middle line:84%
And, with the book
and the meditations,

00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:51.910 align:middle line:84%
it's just such a compelling way
to create community, you know,

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:56.981 align:middle line:84%
and to get a group of friends
together and start that process

00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:58.249 align:middle line:90%
with a group of people.

00:46:58.249 --> 00:46:59.817 align:middle line:84%
I've got some friends in
Florida that are doing it now,

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:03.821 align:middle line:84%
that email me every week and
they'll ask me questions,

00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:06.024 align:middle line:84%
you know, which we're
available for that.

00:47:06.024 --> 00:47:06.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Nice.

00:47:06.524 --> 00:47:07.859 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: If you watch
the film and you're inspired,

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.263 align:middle line:84%
and you want to buy the book and
start a Dreaming Heaven group,

00:47:12.263 --> 00:47:14.232 align:middle line:84%
then we're available
through the website

00:47:14.232 --> 00:47:15.867 align:middle line:90%
to help out any way we can.

00:47:15.867 --> 00:47:17.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's so
interesting because you seem

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:22.807 align:middle line:84%
like such a visionary, somebody
who really doesn't just sit back

00:47:22.807 --> 00:47:25.877 align:middle line:84%
and wait for things to
happen, you go after it;

00:47:25.877 --> 00:47:28.413 align:middle line:84%
you have the vision
and you do it.

00:47:28.413 --> 00:47:31.883 align:middle line:84%
And, I don't know if
you've always been this much

00:47:31.883 --> 00:47:33.584 align:middle line:90%
of a visionary in your life.

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:34.986 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: You know,

00:47:34.986 --> 00:47:36.521 align:middle line:84%
I don't know
if it's being a visionary,

00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:38.623 align:middle line:84%
or if I'm just no --
I'm just ready to go.

00:47:38.623 --> 00:47:40.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's not normal!

00:47:40.925 --> 00:47:43.928 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's something
special about that.

00:47:43.928 --> 00:47:45.563 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:48.333 align:middle line:90%
You know, life is so --

00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:51.269 align:middle line:84%
what I got out of
recovery that inspired me,

00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:59.277 align:middle line:84%
is how deeply sweet, and
compelling, and true,

00:47:59.277 --> 00:48:03.881 align:middle line:84%
and honest life really is,
when we have the opportunity

00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.351 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect to our
heart and soul.

00:48:06.351 --> 00:48:10.355 align:middle line:84%
When we have the opportunity
to come back and reclaim faith

00:48:10.355 --> 00:48:13.691 align:middle line:84%
in our self, and
realize, you know what?

00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:15.360 align:middle line:90%
I've always been good enough.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.861 align:middle line:84%
I may have done a
lot of crazy things,

00:48:16.861 --> 00:48:19.464 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is I've
never not been good enough.

00:48:19.464 --> 00:48:21.232 align:middle line:84%
I've behaved in different
ways...

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:22.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Like you
forgot that, yeah.

00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:22.934 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:48:22.934 --> 00:48:24.335 align:middle line:90%
We forget who we are.

00:48:24.335 --> 00:48:27.672 align:middle line:84%
We lose that relationship with
our self and, when that happens,

00:48:27.672 --> 00:48:30.041 align:middle line:84%
of course, we're just kind
of at the mercy of the world.

00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:31.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Sure.

00:48:31.442 --> 00:48:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: But when it comes
full circle, and we come back

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.447 align:middle line:84%
to the truth of who we really
are, the entire context

00:48:36.447 --> 00:48:39.317 align:middle line:84%
of being alive completely
shifts and changes,

00:48:39.317 --> 00:48:42.053 align:middle line:84%
and you realize everything
is alive,

00:48:42.053 --> 00:48:43.921 align:middle line:90%
and everything is conscious.

00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:47.659 align:middle line:84%
You know? It's like the
ancient indigenous wisdom,

00:48:47.659 --> 00:48:50.828 align:middle line:84%
that the trees, and the wind,
and the rain, and the creeks,

00:48:50.828 --> 00:48:53.531 align:middle line:84%
that everything is an
aspect of the Creator.

00:48:53.531 --> 00:48:54.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm-hmm.

00:48:54.632 --> 00:48:56.801 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And that's
really what happens,

00:48:56.801 --> 00:48:58.569 align:middle line:90%
or what happened to me, anyway.

00:48:58.569 --> 00:49:01.305 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I see
happen with a lot of people,

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:03.341 align:middle line:84%
through the Dreaming
Heaven experiences,

00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:07.011 align:middle line:84%
and through the perspective
of what I call recovery,

00:49:07.011 --> 00:49:08.513 align:middle line:90%
but that I like to create

00:49:08.513 --> 00:49:10.715 align:middle line:84%
in the treatment programs
that I'm a part of.

00:49:10.715 --> 00:49:11.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's what drives you.

00:49:11.883 --> 00:49:14.185 align:middle line:84%
That's what moves
you, is that...

00:49:14.185 --> 00:49:14.986 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:49:14.986 --> 00:49:15.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ...that passion is

00:49:15.987 --> 00:49:18.356 align:middle line:84%
in letting other
people know about that?

00:49:18.356 --> 00:49:18.923 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah!

00:49:18.923 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:20.158 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It is.

00:49:20.158 --> 00:49:20.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:21.793 align:middle line:90%
I can...

00:49:21.793 --> 00:49:22.994 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It's, you
know, it's what better --

00:49:22.994 --> 00:49:26.364 align:middle line:84%
what is there better to do
in this world than that?

00:49:26.364 --> 00:49:27.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow [laughter]!

00:49:27.699 --> 00:49:31.002 align:middle line:84%
You definitely, I mean, you're
a wonderful person to talk

00:49:31.002 --> 00:49:32.303 align:middle line:90%
about it, because you've been

00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:34.105 align:middle line:84%
through so many different
experiences in life,

00:49:34.105 --> 00:49:37.542 align:middle line:84%
that this is what you choose
now, and it's beautiful.

00:49:37.542 --> 00:49:39.343 align:middle line:84%
I also know that
you're still singing.

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:40.044 align:middle line:90%
You're still singing.

00:49:40.044 --> 00:49:41.179 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh, yeah.

00:49:41.179 --> 00:49:41.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: You're never
going to stop singing.

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:42.346 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:42.914 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:49:42.914 --> 00:49:43.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yep.

00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:44.515 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:49:44.515 --> 00:49:45.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Take a look
at this clip

00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:48.486 align:middle line:84%
and you can see Lee
singing [laughter]!

00:49:48.486 --> 00:49:50.721 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: You have
been run through the mill.

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:52.690 align:middle line:84%
[Background talking] You
have been disintegrated.

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:53.558 align:middle line:90%
You have been...

00:49:53.558 --> 00:49:54.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Reconstituted!

00:49:54.525 --> 00:49:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick:
...reconstituted...

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.062 align:middle line:90%
>> And regurgitate!

00:49:58.062 --> 00:50:00.832 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: And now, I
return complete responsibility

00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:04.735 align:middle line:84%
for your dream back
over to you [laughter].

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:13.811 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:19.617 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music] Every
single journey that happened

00:50:19.617 --> 00:50:22.887 align:middle line:84%
in Teotihuacan holds
the opportunity

00:50:22.887 --> 00:50:27.525 align:middle line:84%
for everyone that's
participating to come

00:50:27.525 --> 00:50:32.597 align:middle line:84%
to terms with, you know, who
they are and what they're doing,

00:50:32.597 --> 00:50:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's just so
inspiring to me.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.402 align:middle line:84%
You know? And every
group is so different.

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:41.439 align:middle line:84%
And this interesting
thing about Teo is that,

00:50:41.439 --> 00:50:43.875 align:middle line:84%
while the group experience
is going on,

00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:46.344 align:middle line:84%
I'm having my own
experience at the same time.

00:50:46.344 --> 00:50:48.846 align:middle line:84%
>> In the law, man brings the
information from the light.

00:50:48.846 --> 00:50:54.485 align:middle line:84%
We could say the esoteric
understanding of spirit comes

00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:56.120 align:middle line:90%
through the new wall, male.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:01.692 align:middle line:84%
But the female has to find a way
to plant the seeds to bring it

00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:10.768 align:middle line:84%
into form, to bring it into a
useable form in our humanity.

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:16.073 align:middle line:84%
The corollary that goes
with that is if, in the law,

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:19.944 align:middle line:84%
woman wants something,
she gets it.

00:51:19.944 --> 00:51:21.312 align:middle line:84%
>> There's not words
that can describe it.

00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:24.515 align:middle line:84%
There's a great mystery that
occurs, and to bring that back,

00:51:24.515 --> 00:51:27.618 align:middle line:84%
and to have a little piece of
it living here, looking at you,

00:51:27.618 --> 00:51:30.555 align:middle line:84%
and looking at Teo,
there's no difference.

00:51:30.555 --> 00:51:32.657 align:middle line:84%
The energetic opportunity
that's available there,

00:51:32.657 --> 00:51:34.792 align:middle line:90%
is your own heart opening.

00:51:34.792 --> 00:51:37.195 align:middle line:84%
And the heart that's opening,
is the heart of all creation.

00:51:37.195 --> 00:51:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think
I really believed

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.201 align:middle line:90%
in it and, now, I believe.

00:51:43.201 --> 00:51:46.704 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll have to go back to
our homes, and our jobs and,

00:51:46.704 --> 00:51:48.005 align:middle line:84%
you know, interact
with the people

00:51:48.005 --> 00:51:50.741 align:middle line:84%
that we have been
interacting with,

00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:54.912 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences
will be different.

00:51:54.912 --> 00:51:58.015 align:middle line:84%
>> And I just felt myself
leaving all this being

00:51:58.015 --> 00:52:02.453 align:middle line:84%
self-importance, and what
was available without all

00:52:02.453 --> 00:52:08.526 align:middle line:84%
that stuff, was the
most unbelievable --

00:52:08.526 --> 00:52:09.961 align:middle line:90%
beautiful isn't even the word.

00:52:09.961 --> 00:52:14.632 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like this way of
being that was completely free.

00:52:14.632 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What I have lived
in this place,

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:21.539 align:middle line:84%
and loved about this place, is
how I feel when I come here.

00:52:21.539 --> 00:52:25.610 align:middle line:84%
What this place does, it
really is beyond being able

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:29.013 align:middle line:84%
to explain it to someone,
because what it is,

00:52:29.013 --> 00:52:33.684 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely the experience.

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:37.255 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to it
through an amazing teacher,

00:52:37.255 --> 00:52:42.927 align:middle line:84%
an amazing messenger,
and now it's mine.

00:52:42.927 --> 00:52:45.329 align:middle line:90%
It's my place.

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:48.232 align:middle line:90%
It's everybody's place.

00:52:48.232 --> 00:52:51.869 align:middle line:84%
It finds a way to own
their experience here.

00:52:51.869 --> 00:52:53.504 align:middle line:84%
And all these people,
they walk around,

00:52:53.504 --> 00:52:55.239 align:middle line:90%
they don't have any idea,

00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:57.375 align:middle line:84%
and there's certainly
nothing wrong with that.

00:52:57.375 --> 00:53:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just a hell of a lot more
fun when you do have an idea.

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:10.221 align:middle line:84%
Teotihuacan; the place
where man becomes God.

00:53:10.221 --> 00:53:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I love what
you've done with this.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.493 align:middle line:84%
Now, were you there during
the 2012 extravaganza?

00:53:15.493 --> 00:53:16.027 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Oh, yeah.

00:53:16.027 --> 00:53:17.161 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:53:17.161 --> 00:53:18.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Was it pretty
packed during that time?

00:53:18.496 --> 00:53:21.032 align:middle line:84%
Because that was the birth
of the Mayan calendar, right?

00:53:21.032 --> 00:53:23.768 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It was the
reset of the Mayan calendar..

00:53:23.768 --> 00:53:26.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, it was
created there, right?

00:53:26.137 --> 00:53:28.839 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It was, yeah.

00:53:28.839 --> 00:53:29.707 align:middle line:90%
Yes. I was there.

00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:31.075 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot
of people there.

00:53:31.075 --> 00:53:35.680 align:middle line:84%
We stayed up all night long that
night, had a huge fire going

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.749 align:middle line:84%
at the Dreaming House in
the yard, and a big group

00:53:38.749 --> 00:53:41.919 align:middle line:84%
of people and, you know, it's
just a celebration of life.

00:53:41.919 --> 00:53:42.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:53:42.753 --> 00:53:44.021 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Life doesn't end.

00:53:44.021 --> 00:53:47.792 align:middle line:84%
We just go from one dimension
to the next, I think.

00:53:47.792 --> 00:53:50.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Was it a
magical evening, or week,

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:51.896 align:middle line:90%
or celebrations everywhere?

00:53:51.896 --> 00:53:52.763 align:middle line:90%
What was it like there?

00:53:52.763 --> 00:53:53.531 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:53:53.531 --> 00:53:55.766 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot going on.

00:53:55.766 --> 00:53:57.868 align:middle line:84%
But, every day is
magical, I'm telling you.

00:53:57.868 --> 00:54:00.538 align:middle line:84%
Teotihuacan and the
energy of that place,

00:54:00.538 --> 00:54:04.542 align:middle line:84%
and how thin the
separation between dimensions

00:54:04.542 --> 00:54:07.912 align:middle line:90%
and worlds is there, is 24/7.

00:54:07.912 --> 00:54:09.113 align:middle line:90%
It's...

00:54:09.113 --> 00:54:10.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Did the -- Did any

00:54:10.214 --> 00:54:11.749 align:middle line:84%
of the shamans tell
you you've been there,

00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:13.484 align:middle line:84%
and your past lives
have been there,

00:54:13.484 --> 00:54:15.753 align:middle line:84%
and lifetimes before
that have been there?

00:54:15.753 --> 00:54:17.154 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:54:17.154 --> 00:54:20.224 align:middle line:84%
I've had -- there's a lady named
Donya Emma

00:54:20.224 --> 00:54:25.763 align:middle line:84%
that is one of the guardian
people of Teo, and Emma

00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:28.132 align:middle line:84%
and I have had that
conversation.

00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:32.236 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you just
truly love something,

00:54:32.236 --> 00:54:34.805 align:middle line:84%
nothing else really matters,
like the story of, "Oh,

00:54:34.805 --> 00:54:36.273 align:middle line:90%
I've been here before."

00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:37.708 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's great and
it's entertaining, but...

00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:38.843 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: But, did it
resonate with you?

00:54:38.843 --> 00:54:39.844 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Oh God,
it resonates with me.

00:54:39.844 --> 00:54:40.678 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:54:40.678 --> 00:54:41.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:42.913 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's interesting,
though.

00:54:42.913 --> 00:54:45.082 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just -- I was talking
about how real you are,

00:54:45.082 --> 00:54:49.653 align:middle line:84%
and just for a second, indulge
me in that conversation,

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:52.156 align:middle line:84%
because past lives,
from your perspective,

00:54:52.156 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:84%
in the real world you live in
as a rancher, and as a father,

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.597 align:middle line:84%
and everything that you
do, as a business man;

00:54:59.597 --> 00:55:02.433 align:middle line:90%
that was real to you, wasn't it?

00:55:02.433 --> 00:55:03.901 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:55:03.901 --> 00:55:05.836 align:middle line:84%
You mean when I first went to
Teo and had that realization?

00:55:05.836 --> 00:55:07.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: When you -- yes.

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:09.774 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Yeah, and
it reframed reality to me.

00:55:09.774 --> 00:55:12.943 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think it
validated the fact that --

00:55:12.943 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and I think this happens with
all of us -- there are places,

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:19.683 align:middle line:84%
and there are people, and there
are situations that we will walk

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:22.720 align:middle line:84%
into and, all of a
sudden, something clicks

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.723 align:middle line:84%
and it's déjà vu, but
it's more than déjà vu.

00:55:25.723 --> 00:55:27.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah!

00:55:27.124 --> 00:55:28.626 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It's like all of
a sudden you realize "Oh my God!

00:55:28.626 --> 00:55:29.860 align:middle line:90%
I know this place.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.796 align:middle line:90%
There's a resonance here."

00:55:31.796 --> 00:55:34.932 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened to
me in Teo the first time,

00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:38.002 align:middle line:84%
it made a lot of
things make sense.

00:55:38.002 --> 00:55:41.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's more
than just the memories

00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:42.773 align:middle line:90%
or neurology that lights up.

00:55:42.773 --> 00:55:43.908 align:middle line:90%
It go - it's beyond that.

00:55:43.908 --> 00:55:45.509 align:middle line:84%
It's your consciousness
that lights up.

00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:46.177 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: It is.

00:55:46.177 --> 00:55:46.744 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:46.744 --> 00:55:47.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:55:47.545 --> 00:55:48.679 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: I think it is.

00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:50.214 align:middle line:84%
And, it's in our DNA,
to a degree, I believe.

00:55:50.214 --> 00:55:51.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's a -- yeah!

00:55:51.415 --> 00:55:53.117 align:middle line:84%
That's really neat to
hear you talk about that.

00:55:53.117 --> 00:55:55.486 align:middle line:84%
That you -- I mean, there's
no doubt that you've got

00:55:55.486 --> 00:55:58.856 align:middle line:84%
such a strong calling and
have created these journeys

00:55:58.856 --> 00:56:00.591 align:middle line:84%
for people there,
that you are a part --

00:56:00.591 --> 00:56:01.859 align:middle line:90%
you don't just do that --

00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:03.627 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could have chosen
anywhere in the world...

00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:04.595 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:56:04.595 --> 00:56:05.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...and you
chose that area

00:56:05.896 --> 00:56:08.833 align:middle line:84%
because your consciousness
resonated with that because,

00:56:08.833 --> 00:56:11.635 align:middle line:84%
most likely, you've been there
many, many lifetimes before.

00:56:11.635 --> 00:56:14.605 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Well, I've had
this thing in my life that,

00:56:14.605 --> 00:56:17.508 align:middle line:84%
like, out of my recovery
experience, I created --

00:56:17.508 --> 00:56:19.643 align:middle line:84%
I starting creating
these treatment centers.

00:56:19.643 --> 00:56:21.412 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was out of gratitude.

00:56:21.412 --> 00:56:22.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm.

00:56:22.813 --> 00:56:24.014 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Life gave me this
opportunity and this experience,

00:56:24.014 --> 00:56:27.618 align:middle line:84%
and gives me the vision,
and it's my responsibility

00:56:27.618 --> 00:56:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to do my part, and
that's create the space,

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.655 align:middle line:90%
and it's the same thing in Teo.

00:56:31.655 --> 00:56:33.424 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing with
the ranch, it's I was born

00:56:33.424 --> 00:56:37.228 align:middle line:84%
into a ranching family,
you know, and I love it.

00:56:37.228 --> 00:56:40.297 align:middle line:84%
And, I love that relationship
to nature, and to the wind,

00:56:40.297 --> 00:56:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and to the water,
and with the animals.

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:56:43.801 --> 00:56:44.368 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: I just,
I love my life.

00:56:44.368 --> 00:56:45.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Mm.

00:56:45.202 --> 00:56:45.836 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: I love my wife.

00:56:45.836 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:90%
I love my babies.

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:47.805 align:middle line:90%
I love it all!

00:56:47.805 --> 00:56:49.240 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's not to love?

00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: [Laughter] Well, you
choose that, you choose that.

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.443 align:middle line:90%
You're not complaining about it.

00:56:52.443 --> 00:56:54.945 align:middle line:84%
You could easily listen
to 10 people complain

00:56:54.945 --> 00:56:57.081 align:middle line:84%
about their lives, and
you're not complaining,

00:56:57.081 --> 00:56:58.048 align:middle line:90%
you are loving it...

00:56:58.048 --> 00:56:59.149 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:00.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...and that's
a great inspiration.

00:57:00.284 --> 00:57:01.118 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: If there's
something that I don't

00:57:01.118 --> 00:57:03.187 align:middle line:90%
like about my life, I change it.

00:57:03.187 --> 00:57:04.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I knew you
were going to say that!

00:57:04.522 --> 00:57:05.723 align:middle line:84%
How did I know you were
going to say that [laughter]?

00:57:05.723 --> 00:57:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>> McCormick: Yeah.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:07.525 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why not?

00:57:07.525 --> 00:57:08.526 align:middle line:90%
>> [Laughter] I love it!

00:57:08.526 --> 00:57:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I love it!

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:11.362 align:middle line:84%
If there was -- that's
a great thing to say.

00:57:11.362 --> 00:57:12.429 align:middle line:90%
"If there's something I don't

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:14.632 align:middle line:84%
like about my life,
I change it."

00:57:14.632 --> 00:57:17.101 align:middle line:84%
That is a great thing
to say, Lee.

00:57:17.101 --> 00:57:18.168 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:19.503 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
an inspiration here.

00:57:19.503 --> 00:57:21.372 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at me like
what's so different about that?

00:57:21.372 --> 00:57:22.806 align:middle line:90%
Why is that so great [laughter]?

00:57:22.806 --> 00:57:25.342 align:middle line:90%
It is, truly, truly.

00:57:25.342 --> 00:57:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: It's
just common sense.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:27.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes, it is.

00:57:27.478 --> 00:57:29.246 align:middle line:90%
It is. Thank you for being here.

00:57:29.246 --> 00:57:32.249 align:middle line:84%

00:57:32.249 --> 00:57:33.984 align:middle line:84%
and for setting these
journeys up for people

00:57:33.984 --> 00:57:35.486 align:middle line:90%
in transforming their lives.

00:57:35.486 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> McCormick: Oh, well,
you're welcome, Lisa.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.022 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate the opportunity.

00:57:38.022 --> 00:57:39.423 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Absolutely.

00:57:39.423 --> 00:57:41.258 align:middle line:84%
