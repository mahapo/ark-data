00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:20.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.720 align:middle line:10%
Welcome to our beautiful
Los Angeles studio.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:10%
One thing I can promise
you about this show

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.080 align:middle line:10%
is that we're always going
to ask you to transform

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:10%
your belief systems, to
challenge your belief systems.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we're doing today.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
on a psychic journey

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
with animal communicator,
Amelia Kinkade.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to learn how to
communicate with our animals.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Amelia and her
unique abilities have

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
been the focus of many national
TV shows, hundreds of articles

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:84%
centered around
animal communication.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But her true passion is
assisting animal rescue

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.960 align:middle line:84%
organizations in
Africa who create

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
safe havens for relocated
tigers, and lions,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and elephants, and
cheetahs, and so much more.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And Amelia also worked
with the Olympic horses

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
for the 2012 Olympics in London.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And she is here in
studio to teach us

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.505 align:middle line:84%
how to listen to the
animals who really own us,

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:90%
that's what you say, right?

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.129 align:middle line:90%
They own us.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:15.904 align:middle line:10%
>>AMELIA KINKADE: Well,
they definitely own us.

00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: They do.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:10%
But we always say
they're our pets.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:10%
Do they take offense to that?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Well, I
take offense to that.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the word "pet"
is very demeaning.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:10%
And one of the most amazing
things about these creatures

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:10%
is that this is the closest
spiritual teacher that you'll

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:10%
ever have in your
heart and home.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:10%
And they teach us
unconditional love.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.905 align:middle line:10%
They teach us how to give
it, and they teach us

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:10%
how to receive it.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So when people say
that animals have jealousy,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:10%
or they have, they try to
manipulate you and so forth,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.246 align:middle line:10%
do they have that
emotional capacity?

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Of course.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.006 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: They do?

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Of course.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:10%
We are one of five
kinds of apes.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:10%
We don't like to admit the
fact that the human monkey is

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:10%
an ape.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:10%
We are an animal.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:10%
So if we think in terms
of we are an animal,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:10%
and every other
creature on this planet

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:10%
can think and feel
in very similar ways.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:10%
We've really
undermined their scope.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:10%
For some strange
reason, human beings

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:10%
think that their
superior in some way

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:10%
to all the other
beings on this Earth,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:10%
and it's simply not true.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:10%
Now one of the most
skeptical radio

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:10%
shows I've ever done-- I've
done a lot of radio shows,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes the
radio hosts just

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:10%
want to take me down
in a kick boxing match.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:10%
This is really funny.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But one guy, he was
just going at it.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:90%
He was going for the throat.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:10%
And at the end of the
entire interview, he said,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:10%
"You know what, Amelia,
I know you're right

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.462 align:middle line:10%
that animals think in pictures,
and that they feel emotion."

00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And I said, "How
do you know that?"

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "Because
I know my dog dreams."

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Hmm.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: I watch her dream.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:10%
So as she's rolling around
thinking and kicking and--

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Making sounds.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Of course, we
all think in pictures.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:10%
And we all feel emotion.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:10%
We all have sensation
in our body.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:10%
That translated into the
animal communication lingo,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:10%
the language of miracles,
which is what I teach.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:10%
Clairaudience is clear
hearing in Latin.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:10%
Now that's the ability
to take information

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:10%
that you're picking up
and turn it into words.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.297 align:middle line:10%
It's not because the
cat is speaking English.

00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: It's because you do.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:10%
So as you're taking
in a frequency,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:10%
they're sending a frequency.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:10%
We're all sending frequencies
out into the world around us.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.251 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: All day.

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:10%
Um-hmm.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And we function
as radio stations.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:10%
Human beings send out, out, out.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:10%
The only reason that we
can't hear the animals

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.709 align:middle line:10%
is because we drown them out.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:10%
>>AMELIA KINKADE:
So we need to learn

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.870 align:middle line:10%
to receive their
communication, their pictures?

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: We need to
learn how to listen.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:10%
We need to learn how
to sit in silence.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:10%
You do send an emotion
or send a wave that

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:10%
disturbs the field
just the exact same way

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:10%
that a dolphin sends sonar.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:10%
When a dolphin sends sonar,
it disturbs the water,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:10%
and that energy goes forward,
and it touches an object,

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:10%
and it forms a feedback loop.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:10%
Now it's going to come back with
the distance of that object,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:10%
the contents of that
object, the shape.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:10%
That's why a dolphin can
tell if a woman's pregnant

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:10%
or if a man has
metal in his body.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:10%
That's why the military
is using them now.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: So we also
have that capacity.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So you have spent
a lot of time in the wild,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:10%
a lot of time in Africa, a
lot of time communicating

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:10%
with these animals in
their natural habitat,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:10%
and also those that
are in captivity.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And your experience and
where you've been really

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
does tell this
story about how they

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.090 align:middle line:90%
communicate with each other.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And tell me the difference
between an animal that's

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
in the wild, say,
for example, a lion

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
or a cheetah in the wild
and one that's in captivity.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.815 align:middle line:90%
What do you get?

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.935 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: They all
have similar stories.

00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:10%
And if you live in the
San Fernando Valley,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:10%
I'll give you a for
instance that you

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:10%
would experience at home.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:10%
One year on Thanksgiving a
few years ago-- of course,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:10%
I've been told don't
fee the raccoons.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:10%
Everybody says don't
feed the raccoons,

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:10%
because they can be dangerous.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:10%
They carry diseases.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:10%
We, in California, are not
supposed to feed the raccoons.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:90%
So, of course, what do I do?

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to
feed the raccoons.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It's Thanksgiving day.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:10%
I have all these
delicious leftovers,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:10%
and I was sitting, waiting
and praying that one of them

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:10%
would come.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:10%
And out of the
corner of my yard,

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:10%
this little face appears,
and here she comes.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:10%
And I said to her,
are you alone?

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.944 align:middle line:10%
And she said, no, my
partner's with me.

00:06:07.944 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:10%
And I said, is it
a boy or a girl.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:10%
She said, it's a boy.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:10%
I said, is it your husband?

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:10%
She said, no, it's my son.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:10%
And I said, would you
please go get him for me?

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:10%
And she said, OK,
I'll go get him.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:10%
She disappears, comes
back with her baby.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:10%
And the two of them did the
world's cutest thing where

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:10%
they wash their
hands, and they wash

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:10%
the little pieces of apples
and yams that I'd given them,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:10%
and the grapes, and
they ate with me.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:10%
And I honored the fact that it
was Thanksgiving for them, too.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:10%
And if there's one
thing I'm thankful for,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:10%
it's that there are other
animals on this planet.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes, I can
understand that.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:10%
We actually have a
whole demo reel of you

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.584 align:middle line:10%
in action with your animals.

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:10%
I want the audience
to take a look

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:10%
at Amelia Kinkade in action.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.150 align:middle line:10%
Take a look.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:10%

amazing work with these animals.

Now the ones that
are in captivity.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:10%
What is it that they say to you?

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.640 align:middle line:10%
Do they like to be in captivity?

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:10%
Do they--

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: I'll tell you
what, every single case is

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:10%
individual.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:10%
And this is very controversial
for me to say this,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.233 align:middle line:10%
because even when I wrote
my first book, "Straight

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.691 align:middle line:10%
from the Horse's Mouth," which
was the last time I saw you.

00:08:56.691 --> 00:08:57.466 align:middle line:10%
It was 2001 then.

00:08:57.466 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And that sent me on
a world tour for the last 11

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:10%
years teaching in 10
to 15 countries a year.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:06.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Really amazing.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:10%
And back then, I was
completely anti-zoo.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:10%
Now I work very closely
with the Johannesburg zoo.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:10%
And some of the happiest
animals in captivity I've

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.405 align:middle line:10%
ever seen in my life--

00:09:19.405 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Really?

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: --are in
the Johannesburg Zoo.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:10%
And the last time I
was in Los Angeles,

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:10%
I visited the zoo after hours.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:10%
One of the docents
give me a private tour.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:10%
And I discovered that
all of our animals

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.090 align:middle line:10%
have been rescued from
horrendous situations.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:10%
It's really unfair
to say, well, we

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.520 align:middle line:10%
don't agree with having
any animals in captivity,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.124 align:middle line:10%
because the bottom line is
there's nowhere for them to go.

00:09:44.124 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, that's
refreshing to hear.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:10%
We went on a zoo field
trip with my daughter who

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.239 align:middle line:10%
we're going to meet
in a little bit,

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:10%
and it's such a great
educational experience

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.467 align:middle line:10%
for kids to be able
to go to the zoo

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:10%
and see these animals that
they would really never

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:10%
see in their lifetime.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:10%
So that part of it does
definitely serve its purpose,

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:05.311 align:middle line:10%
but I always wonder, do
they enjoy it in there?

00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Every single
one is individual.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Um-hmm.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:10%
That makes sense.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And it also
depends on their enclosures.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:10%
When I went up to the
orangutans-- here's

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:10%
another baby story-- I was
going from each pen to pen

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:10%
asking the animals, how are you?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:10%
Are you OK?

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.295 align:middle line:10%
Do you need anything
that you're not getting?

00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:26.370 align:middle line:10%
Are you happy?

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:10%
In Joburg, they'll take
in the national news

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.790 align:middle line:10%
and actually get the
animals what they need.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:10%
They'll listen to what
the animals tell me,

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:10%
and they'll make the changes,
as they did on the Olympic show

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.607 align:middle line:10%
horse team.

00:10:38.607 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:10%
That was outrageous.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I can't wait
to hear that story.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.349 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Another
amazing story, but this

00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:10%
is a pretty amazing story.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:10%
So some of the animals are
not as happy as others.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Elephants in captivity are
a very controversial topic.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
In general, they don't
belong in the zoo at all.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Because they need
to roam several miles a day.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:10%
One of the most humane zoos
I've ever seen in my life

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.090 align:middle line:10%
was in Northern England.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:10%
A lady named Molly Baden
would move the enclosures back

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:10%
so the elephants could walk
a fresh mile every morning.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:10%
They're herd animals.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:10%
They need to be in groups.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:10%
They're more family
oriented than we are.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:10%
They're more loving than we are.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:10%
If one elephant
gets sick, the herd

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:10%
will assign a doctor or a nurse.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.390 align:middle line:10%
If there's a baby,
there's an entire group

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:10%
of nannies and midwives.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:10%
It's not just the mom.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:10%
They grieve their dead.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:10%
They bury their dead.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:10%
They have a more humane
operative society

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:10%
than human beings do.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But this story is about an
orangutan in a Los Angeles zoo.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:10%
This enormous orangutan
came up to me,

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:10%
and I was standing
looking at her enclosure.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, we have a beautiful
swing set, and we've got nets,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.790 align:middle line:10%
and it's really nice.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:10%
And I said how are you?

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:10%
And she said, oh-- now
again, this sounds insane,

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:10%
but I pick up pictures.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:10%
We all think in pictures.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:10%
When we learn how
to quiet our minds,

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:10%
we can start picking
up images as if you're

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:10%
watching a movie, from
another living human being.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.484 align:middle line:10%
And that's how you know
when somebody's lying.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Quieting your
mind is the key, though.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Right.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And everybody
has this experience

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:10%
that they know that a person
is not telling the truth,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:10%
or not telling the whole truth.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:10%
Or if you're a
mother, you know when

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.490 align:middle line:10%
your daughter is lying to you.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:10%
Even if they're a good liar, the
feelings in your body are cues.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I teach people to use their
bodies as instruments.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So I said to this mom,
are you all right?

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:10%
And I got an incredible
feeling of joy and well being

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:10%
and, again, if you can translate
that frequency of energy

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:10%
into language, something that
happens inside your brain.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:10%
It's not that the
animal's speaking English,

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:10%
it's that your brain is
translating it into something

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:10%
you understand.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:10%
That could be a picture.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:10%
That could be a smell.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.860 align:middle line:10%
That could be a feeling.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:10%
That could be a taste.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:10%
And she said, I want you
to thank the humans here,

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:10%
because they've taken
such wonderful care

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:10%
of me and my baby.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:10%
And I said, you have a baby?

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle line:10%
She said, yes, I
have a new infant.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:10%
And my baby might not have
lived if the humans hadn't

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:10%
intervened.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:10%
The humans took wonderful
care of my baby.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:10%
Now, I couldn't see any
baby in this enclosure,

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:10%
and I said, wow, well,
where's your baby?

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:39.205 align:middle line:10%
She swings out of sight and
comes back with a tiny infant.

00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Little.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: A tiny
orangutan infant

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:10%
with a little hair
like a porcupine.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:10%
And she holds the baby up to
me, so that I can meet her baby.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I've seen those
orangutans in the zoo just

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:84%
laying out, and feeding,
and enjoying life.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they do have
a really good time.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of babies,
we have a picture here

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of you feeding, with a baby
bottle, a gigantic animal.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Now that's my baby.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
only tiger that's

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:90%
ever been on the Jay Leno Show.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a movie star tiger.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge tiger.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: I went up
to this sanctuary,

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:10%
and the man actually trains
animals for the movies which,

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:10%
again, is quite controversial.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to see for myself
how they're treated.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I'm glad you did.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:31.719 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: I walked
into his pen,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:10%
and the man who runs
the place-- you'll

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:10%
have to get on my
website to find it out.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to blow the
whistle for him on your TV show.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: He's a
very big skeptic,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:10%
so he comes out
la, la, la, la, la.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.735 align:middle line:10%
And I said to the tiger,
what's your favorite toy.

00:14:50.735 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:10%
And he said, it's
an orange ball.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.568 align:middle line:10%
And I said, who's
your best friend?

00:14:53.568 --> 00:14:54.682 align:middle line:10%
He said it's a lion.

00:14:54.682 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:10%
I said, a lion?

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.800 align:middle line:10%
He said, yeah, it's a lion.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.857 align:middle line:10%
And an orange ball?

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:10%
He said, oh yeah, he
throws the orange ball.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:10%
I love the orange ball.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:10%
So I told the man.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:10%
He almost fainted.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.202 align:middle line:10%

animal wrangler?

00:15:07.202 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Right.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Didn't believe
in animal communication.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.388 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: No, didn't at all.

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And then he said he'd spent
the day playing football

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:10%
with this tiger with
an orange football.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he opens the
enclosure next to him

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and the lion comes rushing
at-- you don't see this.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't see lions
and tigers that

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
are best friends who
roll around together.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They
had other animals

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.980 align:middle line:10%
who named their friends by name.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:10%
You've got a kangaroo picture.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah,
there's a couple there.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: You've got a kangaroo
picture, and I'll tell you,

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.530 align:middle line:10%
this is one of the
funniest stories.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:10%
When we were on the
way to the sanctuary,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:10%
I was tuning into somebody who
was very impatiently waiting

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:10%
to meet me.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:10%
And this person was really
upset, pacing back and forth.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:10%
And I said where are you?

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm in this
horrible metal cage,

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and I don't belong in here,
and I shouldn't be in here.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And when are you coming?

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I was with Amy Smart at
the time, the beautiful movie

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.460 align:middle line:90%
star.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:84%
She had just done a fashion show
that had some of these animals.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And some animal rights'
activists came down on her

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:84%
very strongly, so
I went up to see

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:90%
how they're actually treated.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:10%
We went up together
so that we could

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:10%
vouch for the place, which
I can more than vouch for.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:10%
And when I got to this
impatient, angry animal,

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:10%
it was a little wallaby.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:10%
And the wallaby said
to me, tell my keeper--

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:10%
And I said, what
does she look like?

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well, she's got
long, beautiful, brunette,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:10%
curly hair.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:10%
Looks kind of like you.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well,
tell her that I

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:10%
want to get in the
Jacuzzi with her,

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.780 align:middle line:10%
and I want to get in the
Jacuzzi under the stars.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:10%
I go out in the
green grass, and she

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.469 align:middle line:10%
gets in the Jacuzzi
under the stars,

00:16:54.469 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:10%
but I want to get in the
Jacuzzi under the stars.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.218 align:middle line:10%
I said, what's your
favorite place to be?

00:16:58.218 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:10%
He said I like to sit in her
arms in front of the fire

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.895 align:middle line:10%
as we watch TV.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: The kangaroo?

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.415 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: The
kangaroo says this.

00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:10%
Now I couldn't have
been more out on a limb

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:10%
that I was thinking,
if I say this,

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to sound bona fide
crazy, like lock me up crazy.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:10%
And I went ahead and told them.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:10%
The keeper came out
who looks like you,

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:10%
had just moved him from
her home in West Hollywood

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:10%
where he was kept in
the grass by the Jacuzzi

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.857 align:middle line:10%
that she would get in
under the stars at night,

00:17:32.857 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:10%
and he wasn't allowed
to get in the Jacuzzi.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:10%
He'd sit and watch her
get in the Jacuzzi.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.586 align:middle line:10%
And she said his favorite
place in the world

00:17:39.586 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:10%
was sitting in
front of fireplace

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:10%
watching TV snuggling
in her arms.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness,
what an amazing kangaroo.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: But
every living being

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:10%
is thinking, feeling, and having
an experience of life on Earth

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:10%
that's very similar to ours.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:10%
They grieve, they laugh,
they miss their families.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:10%
They miss their mates.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:10%
They're frustrated.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:10%
They have an incredible scope
of emotion and rational thought.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: You have
an amazing story

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:10%
about the animal that
witnessed an actual murder.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: I do, and I've
just released my first crime

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:10%
novel, which is a wicked,
scandalous, hilarious novel.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:10%
But it's based on
a true concept.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:10%
And many years ago,
I was contacted

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:10%
by a woman who thought that her
daughter had committed suicide.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:10%
And she had the daughter's dog.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:10%
Now this suicide
happened in London,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.550 align:middle line:10%
and the woman was in the US.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:10%
She contacted me to try
to rehabilitate the dog.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:10%
And when I tuned
into the dog, the dog

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:10%
showed me the beautiful,
young woman getting murdered.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:10%
It was not a suicide.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.214 align:middle line:10%
It was a murder.

00:18:59.214 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That's terrifying for
you to be able to visualize.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And I had it
re-enacted in front of my eyes.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:10%
And I could see the murderer.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:10%
I could see every
detail about the murder.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:10%
This is incredibly creepy.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is like something
out of an Alfred Hitchcock

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:10%
story, really.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.872 align:middle line:10%
He hung her by a dog collar
on the back of a door.

00:19:25.872 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Too much information.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Crazy.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:35.105 align:middle line:84%
But the dog named the murderer
by name, gave me the name.

00:19:35.105 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So what did you do?

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And it turned out
to be the girl's boyfriend.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:45.685 align:middle line:10%
And Scotland Yard kept the case
open on the testimony of a dog.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Through an
animal communicator,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:10%
which would be you.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Though me.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Through you.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And on a
more practical level,

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:10%
there have been studies
done with plants

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:10%
that when an EKG is
hooked up to a plant,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:10%
even a plant will
respond to violence.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:10%
If someone who was violent in
a room walks into the same--

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:12.600 align:middle line:10%
these plants have registered
that frequency of violence.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:10%
So of course, a dog would be
able to identify a killer.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And so
would pets at home.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: You could
put cats in a lineup,

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:10%
they're going to react.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hmm, really.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:90%
You could put cats in a lineup.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
You could put dogs in a lineup,
and they would react to--

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.296 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Of
course, they would.

00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Huh, and so
this person was caught,

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:10%
I believe, and you've probably
done a lot of different animal

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.062 align:middle line:10%
communications with
the police department

00:20:38.062 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:10%
with different investigators.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:10%
Are they skeptical?

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Absolutely not.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:10%
You wouldn't believe how
supportive the police are.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:10%
If I contact the police--
I worked on a case

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:55.300 align:middle line:10%
where there were horses present,
and if I'm getting specifics,

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:10%
that the criminal was
a veterinarian's son

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:10%
who got back at his dad
by mutilating horses,

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:10%
and their last name
was Cunningham.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:10%
Then the veterinarians--
I mean the police

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:09.887 align:middle line:10%
have something to go on.

00:21:09.887 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Any lead is a good lead.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.761 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They
always say thank you.

00:21:12.761 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:10%
We suspected it was the
veterinarian's son trying

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.975 align:middle line:10%
to get back at his father.

00:21:17.975 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Let's talk a
little bit about horses,

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:10%
and I know you're a big
horse communicator as well.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
picture of you

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:90%
hugging a horse in the field.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about horses, and how
do you communicate with them.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
They seem like they so
want to communicate.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: They do.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:10%
Horses are some of the
most experienced healers

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:10%
on this planet.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:10%

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And they're so in
tune with the human beings.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.485 align:middle line:10%
One of the stories, I think
I put this story in "Straight

00:21:46.485 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:10%
from the Horse's
Mouth," that I went

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:10%
to do a private reading
in Southern California.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.624 align:middle line:10%
Now sometimes I am, I'm
back in Los Angeles.

00:21:53.624 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm about to be teaching
at the Glen ivy which

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:10%
is so exciting down in
Corona and will also

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:10%
be working with
horses down there.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.040 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And as I'm walking
through the horse barn,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:10%
the horses will come up and
say, will you talk to my mother?

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.664 align:middle line:10%
Will you talk to my father?

00:22:06.664 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:10%
Will you talk to my-- and
they'll yell out their names.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:10%
So as I'm walking through,
I'm hearing Christy, Miriam,

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:10%
Allison, Bob.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And one of them was really
insistent, and said,

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.027 align:middle line:10%
will you talk to my mother?

00:22:21.027 --> 00:22:22.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, I was there to
see a different client,

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.485 align:middle line:10%
and her horse, and
I said, I don't even

00:22:24.485 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:10%
know if your mother
believes in any of this,

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:10%
but we'll try to get
the word that you

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:10%
need to talk to your mother.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:10%
I said what does your
human mother look like?

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:10%
And the horse showed
me a blond woman

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:10%
with a broken wrist, a cast on
her wrist, on her left wrist.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I need to talk
to her, because I threw her,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.762 align:middle line:10%
and I want to apologize.

00:22:45.762 --> 00:22:46.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.526 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And to
make it even crazier,

00:22:48.526 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:10%
this is where it gets
very interesting.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.608 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Remember I talked about
challenging belief systems?

00:22:52.608 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Well, everybody
who owns a horse,

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:10%
or is owned by a
horse, will understand,

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:10%
this isn't that
much of a challenge,

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:10%
that they're in
contact with you.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.087 align:middle line:10%
We don't ride around
on our cat's backs.

00:23:04.087 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Horses
are a herd animal.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.980 align:middle line:10%
They're already telepathic.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:10%
They're in tune with each other.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:10%
They're a group.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:10%
They're a very loving,
listening, sensitive group.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:10%
If there's a
predator introduced,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:10%
all the horses will react to
try to protect each other.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:10%
They're not
competitive by nature.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:10%
They're a very loving,
docile prey animal.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:10%
They're not a predator.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:10%
So this horse, who has his
human on his back all the time,

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:10%
said to me, she needs an
emergency hysterectomy.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.330 align:middle line:10%
And my vision was just
the pain, and the blood,

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:10%
and I thought wow,
does she know?

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.200 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well, she's
struggling with it.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:10%
You need to tell her.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:10%
So when I met with the woman,
who had a cast on her wrist,

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:10%
and the blond hair,
and he had thrown her,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:10%
and he got to apologize,
because it was a mistake.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.430 align:middle line:10%
He just lost his
footing on a hillside.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.480 align:middle line:10%
I told her, I said,
you've got some problems

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:10%
that you need to address.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:10%
And she, within a
couple of weeks,

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:10%
she had an emergency
hysterectomy.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.415 align:middle line:10%
She died on the table.

00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, my god.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Had an out of
body experience, came back.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:10%
And he knew before she did.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.476 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, my
god, what a story.

00:24:27.476 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Ooh, I
have a story for you.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.380 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, you have
so many stories.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.963 align:middle line:10%
Well, wait, I've got
to ask you about,

00:24:31.963 --> 00:24:33.691 align:middle line:10%
because you have
pictures of when

00:24:33.691 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:10%
I talked to you about
this picture of the animal

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.380 align:middle line:10%
in their stalls, you said
horses don't necessarily

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.620 align:middle line:10%
love being in these stalls.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, it would
be as if somebody puts you

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:90%
in a shower stall.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:10%
And you were allowed
out for one hour a day,

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:10%
and during that one hour, you
had to be the perfect slave.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:10%
And god forbid you had
a toothache that day,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:10%
or you had a stomach
ache that day.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.340 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe you wanted to
get to know a male horse,

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:10%
or maybe they shipped
out your best friend,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:10%
or maybe they won't
let you breed.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe they bred you,
and they sold your baby.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, eventually
it's going to add up.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Where would
they rather be?

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.660 align:middle line:10%
In the pasture under the stars.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Acting like a horse.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Acting like
a horse with herds.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: In a herd with
their noses together talking

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:10%
about their day.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, tell me
about the Olympic horse.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: The Olympic horse
is also a similar story.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.800 align:middle line:10%
Seven weeks before the Olympics,
one of the top horses on Earth

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.530 align:middle line:10%
just threw his toys.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.132 align:middle line:10%
He just decided, nope,
it's not happening.

00:25:43.132 --> 00:25:44.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I'm not racing?

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.393 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: This is
not on, just not on.

00:25:46.393 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:10%
He was supposed to
win the Olympics.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.970 align:middle line:10%
He's one of the top
jumpers in the world.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:56.625 align:middle line:10%
So I flew to Germany to go
meet this magnificent horse.

00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: You were called to
come and communicate with him.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: To see if he would
tell me what was happening.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:10%
Now when I teach,
I teach you how

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:10%
to use your body
as an instrument.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.920 align:middle line:10%
I literally have
students going, ow.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.157 align:middle line:10%
Or, oh, oh.

00:26:12.157 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Oh, and that doesn't
have to do with whether or not

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:10%
you think you're a
spiritual person,

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:10%
or how much you meditate.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.770 align:middle line:10%
That has to do with how in
touch you are with your body.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I could have a room full
of football players,

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to go, oh,
you see that German shepherd?

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.050 align:middle line:10%
She's limping right there.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:10%
A bad knee-- because they're
more in touch on a quantum

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:10%
level with their cells.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: So this
horse was getting

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:10%
all these grueling
tests, and vets

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:10%
were flying in from
all over the world

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:10%
and convinced it was
a physical problem.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:10%
And I asked him,
what's going on?

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.150 align:middle line:10%
One of the beauties of
animal communication

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:10%
is that sometimes
you can't determine

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:00.830 align:middle line:10%
whether an emotional
problem or a health problem

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:10%
have exactly the same symptoms.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.480 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you've
got a cat that's

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:10%
grieving the loss
of her mate, she

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:10%
may have the same symptoms
as stomach cancer.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:10%
She won't eat.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:10%
She's lethargic.

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I see.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.725 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: She's sick.

00:27:16.725 --> 00:27:17.850 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And it's emotional.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: With
horses, they colic,

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:10%
because there's such
emotional beings.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.702 align:middle line:10%
But when I met him, I
said what's going on?

00:27:24.702 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:10%
He said, I want a girlfriend.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.254 align:middle line:10%


00:27:28.254 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: The horse said that?

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:10%
He was done with racing.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.568 align:middle line:10%
He wanted a girlfriend.

00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:34.730 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Yeah, well, he
said, what's in it for me?

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.410 align:middle line:10%
Every week I go
win, and how long

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:10%
do I have to be
on this treadmill?

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:10%
And when do I get a family?

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:41.310 align:middle line:10%
When do I get a girlfriend?

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.268 align:middle line:10%
When do I get children?

00:27:42.268 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:10%
When do I get to
stand in a field

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.330 align:middle line:10%
and eat grass under the
stars and act like a horse?

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.980 align:middle line:10%
If I can actually say,
you've got three years.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:10%
You win the Olympics,
and then you'll get this.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:10%
We can negotiate.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing
about this situation,

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:84%
he said he had a best friend
that was a gorgeous bay

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.746 align:middle line:84%
horse that never got to
compete at this level,

00:28:06.746 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and that he wanted his best
friend to go to the Olympics,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.724 align:middle line:90%
because it was his turn to win.

00:28:10.724 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how did he
communicate that to you?

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:90%
With pictures?

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: He shows me a
picture of the bay horse.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.870 align:middle line:10%
He shows me the love
he has for the horse.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:10%
He shows me himself being
taken off to the shows

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:10%
while his best friend
has to stay at home.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:26.280 align:middle line:10%
And he wants the best friend
to go out and have the glory

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:10%
and win.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.180 align:middle line:10%
This happens just
lightning fast,

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.269 align:middle line:10%
but it's not that different
from watching a movie.

00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:10%
You're taking in a
lot of information

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.790 align:middle line:10%
when you're watching a movie.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:10%
So I'm taking in as much
as quickly as I can.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.330 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And you said that
he saw in the distance

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:45.880 align:middle line:10%
another horse that did
have a girlfriend, right?

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Well, it
was an all-male barn.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.220 align:middle line:10%
And they had-- come to find
out they'd brought in one mare.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:10%
And they gave the mare
to one of his buddies

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:10%
who was across from
him, so he could

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:10%
see his buddy with
the new girlfriend,

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.420 align:middle line:10%
but he wasn't allowed to
have a new girlfriend.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
accomplishments of my life

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is that they took his best
friend to the Olympics instead

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:90%
of him who did extremely well.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.610 align:middle line:84%
They got him a girlfriend,
and now he's winning again.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:14.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.625 align:middle line:10%
Oh, my goodness, and now
was the owner skeptical,

00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:10%
or were you preaching to the
choir when this man brought you

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:21.170 align:middle line:10%
in.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:10%
Did he hear about you
because he understands

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:24.790 align:middle line:10%
animal communication?

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Well, the horse
world is far more advanced

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:10%
than a lot of other species.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.960 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's not
true in Africa.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.710 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And it's actually
not even true with farmers.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:10%
If I'm working in rural
England or Germany,

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:10%
and there's something wrong
with the farmer's sheep,

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:44.480 align:middle line:10%
he's serious.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.870 align:middle line:10%
This is not a joke.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:10%
He wants to know what's
wrong with my sheep?

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.609 align:middle line:10%
What's wrong with my chickens?

00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: This is his livelihood.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.150 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: What's
wrong with my horse?

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And a lot of
these people genuinely

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:10%
love these animals, and
they genuinely care.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:10%
And in Africa, you're
living alongside them.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:10%
If something's wrong with a
wild lion, you need to know.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: You need to know.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.305 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We actually have
a beautiful picture of you

00:30:09.305 --> 00:30:11.650 align:middle line:84%
in the wild with
these gorgeous lions.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:84%
This is such a
beautiful picture.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Now are you in a safari area?

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.599 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: And you are coming.

00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Apparently.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: You are
coming, and then you

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:26.214 align:middle line:84%
can see for yourself, Lisa,
exactly what goes on in Africa.

00:30:26.214 --> 00:30:27.880 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, my
husband was just there,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:10%
and he said that in the
safari that he was on,

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:10%
he watched from about a mile
away with these animals,

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.332 align:middle line:10%
and they were further
out in the distance.

00:30:37.332 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: I watched
from five feet

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:10%
away when the lions
came up to the truck.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.430 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Do you call
them ahead of time?

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.414 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They call
me ahead of time.

00:30:46.414 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: They call you.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They call
me ahead of time,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:10%
and I see where
they're going to be,

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:10%
and I see how many
there are going to be.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:10%
And I see what the
issues are, and why

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:10%
they're taking the meeting.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:10%
But when I take people on these
safaris and our entire agenda

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:10%
is simply to love
them, to worship

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:10%
and adore them with all the
reverence that they deserve.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.420 align:middle line:10%
That we can look at
God's masterpieces

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.640 align:middle line:10%
with nothing but joy and
awe, and an open heart

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:10%
and an open mind.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:10%
When there is information
coming in, you'll hear it!

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:84%
You'll be given
that information.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.917 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll know
how to help them.

00:31:26.917 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we actually
have a great picture of you

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:84%
as well in the wild with these--
these are cheetahs, right?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Those are cheetah.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was at Cheetah
Outreach at Cape Town.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And I absolutely love Cape Town.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And the cheetah-- also, this
was also a wonderful story.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.220 align:middle line:10%
I went into the sanctuary,
and one of the cheetah

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.200 align:middle line:10%
was depressed.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.627 align:middle line:10%
Here's case in point.

00:31:52.627 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:10%
That could be a toothache.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:54.740 align:middle line:10%
That could be a stomach ache.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.948 align:middle line:10%
That could be a back problem.

00:31:55.948 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:10%
Who knows?

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:58.169 align:middle line:10%
Who knows what's going on?

00:31:58.169 --> 00:31:59.210 align:middle line:10%
I said, what's happening?

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.260 align:middle line:10%
He said they moved my mate out.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:10%
I said what's your mate's
name, he said, Charlie.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.890 align:middle line:10%
And this is a male cheetah.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.060 align:middle line:10%
And I went, your
girlfriend's name is Charlie?

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:10%
He said, Charlie.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:18.440 align:middle line:10%
She's been shipped up north, and
he was absolutely despondent.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.600 align:middle line:10%
They confirmed that he
had a mate named Charlie

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:10%
that they'd sent up to De Ville
to have her breed with somebody

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:30.400 align:middle line:10%
else, because they're trying
to keep the genetics clean.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.175 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't want
these two together.

00:32:33.175 --> 00:32:33.760 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: It's a
breeding program.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was
heartbroken and furious.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you mentioned
to me that they give--

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And
they were reunited.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: They were.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.680 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They were reunited.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.029 align:middle line:10%
I got to go up and
see Charlie, and I

00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:51.570 align:middle line:10%
said, you need to
get this over with,

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:10%
which boy do you
think is really hot?

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.420 align:middle line:10%
She named him by name.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.294 align:middle line:10%
And I said, that's
the one she wants.

00:32:57.294 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:10%
She wants to be
with that cheetah.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.585 align:middle line:10%
Put them together, let
them get it over with,

00:33:00.585 --> 00:33:02.440 align:middle line:10%
so she can get home
to her husband.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:10%
And they did.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.802 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, my goodness.

00:33:04.802 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: But you know what?

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:08.435 align:middle line:10%
You don't have anything to lose.

00:33:08.435 --> 00:33:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And if the animal is giving
so many detailed facts

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:10%
that you can't dispute, then why
would you not act on something

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:21.310 align:middle line:10%
that has to do with
behavior change.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:26.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So this cheetah had
her cubs, and she had her cubs,

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.880 align:middle line:10%
and there was another
mate that was around

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:10%
as the kind of the surrogate,
or the father figure,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.320 align:middle line:10%
and she was happy, right?

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Well, yeah, they
took her away from her husband.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.330 align:middle line:10%
It would be no different than
if somebody took you away

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:10%
from your husband.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: But you said
they wanted to keep

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:10%
the lines clean,
the genetic lines.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.660 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They
intermingle genetics

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:54.190 align:middle line:10%
with the cheetah to try to
keep them from interbreeding.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: So they had to
move his partner elsewhere,

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't like
that idea at all.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.980 align:middle line:10%
And then they did reunite
them, and he was fine again.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: So one of
the first things

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:11.030 align:middle line:10%
you said when we started the
show was about how humans

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.780 align:middle line:10%
really feel that they can
control the animal species.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:10%
And it seems like
that has gotten

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:21.500 align:middle line:10%
to be such a standard thing
where, as you're talking about,

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:10%
that we give animals
contraceptives.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:10%
That we tell them when they
can and they cannot breed,

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.100 align:middle line:10%
and who they should breed with.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.440 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how far
away have we gotten

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:37.409 align:middle line:10%
from their natural habitat
and is this a problem?

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Well,
it's a huge problem.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.310 align:middle line:10%
And, honestly, one of the issues
that we're having in Africa,

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.750 align:middle line:10%
one of my students who
started a charity to move

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:52.860 align:middle line:10%
all Indian tigers to Africa,
because there's nowhere else

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:10%
to put them.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:59.090 align:middle line:10%
I worked with one of the last
remaining Sumatran tiger cubs.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:10%
She's a beautiful baby.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.450 align:middle line:10%
She's in England, but there are
less than 200 Sumatran tigers

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:10%
in this world.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.220 align:middle line:10%
I had a Siberian tiger cub that
was eight days old in my lap

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.560 align:middle line:10%
in Johannesburg.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.260 align:middle line:10%
His eyes weren't even open yet.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.190 align:middle line:10%
And he's bumbling around
threatening to kill me.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:10%
He just looks like a
little furry pumpkin.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:23.380 align:middle line:10%
It was the cutest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to see him again.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.580 align:middle line:10%
And, of course,
introduce you to him

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:10%
if you want to come with me.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.350 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I want to go on-- I
would go on safari with you,

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.611 align:middle line:10%
by all means, because
you have the ability

00:35:33.611 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:10%
to communicate with these
animals ahead of time.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's learn a little
bit how we can do that.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you send out messages?

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you see pictures?

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.472 align:middle line:84%
Do you attract them to
you with your pictures?

00:35:43.472 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: The
first thing that I'm

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:10%
going to do is completely
flatline my frequency.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:52.050 align:middle line:10%
So rather than going
into a situation where

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.980 align:middle line:10%
we're going to talk
and ignore the cat.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.071 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Or we're
blah, blah, blah.

00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:59.650 align:middle line:10%
We're going to ignore
the elephant or the lion.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:03.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to completely silence
my mind, silence my emotion,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:10%
and go into a state
of meditation.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.310 align:middle line:10%
When you want to
connect to that animal,

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:12.680 align:middle line:10%
you're going to send out a beam
of starlight out of your heart.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:10%
It's going to reach and touch
the heart of that animal

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.150 align:middle line:10%
and light them up.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And anything
that you want to ask

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.760 align:middle line:10%
can be asked by means of
sending a particular emotion.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.040 align:middle line:10%
You can say to your
cat, when you're angry,

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:10%
what do you experience?

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:10%
So the first connection
is the unconditional love.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:10%
I call that resogenesis.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.320 align:middle line:10%
That's establishing
resonance, so that I'm now

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.810 align:middle line:10%
going to vibrate on the
frequency of this lion.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:10%
If you can imagine that
you're in a pool of water,

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:10%
and you're on a raft, and
you're completely still.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.385 align:middle line:10%
If a boat goes by, it's going
to send a wave of energy.

00:36:55.385 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: If
you're still, you're

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.730 align:middle line:90%
going to vibrate on that wave.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:00.529 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:37:00.529 --> 00:37:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: You can't
help but vibrate

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:84%
on that wave,
because you're still.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So the elephant is
sending a wave of emotion.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:10%
The shark is sending
a wave of emotion.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.390 align:middle line:10%
You're little house cat is
sending a wave of emotion.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's intelligence
on those frequencies.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.770 align:middle line:84%
There's quantum
holographic information

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:90%
on those frequencies.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.870 align:middle line:84%
It's no different from the
way a television program is

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:middle line:84%
transmitted throughout
the atmosphere.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've had
such an amazing life.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I saw one of the videos
on your website of you

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:84%
in a shark tank
communicating with sharks.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Oh, I love them.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.460 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.490 align:middle line:10%
What just happened,
and when I start

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.710 align:middle line:10%
teaching in April
in Corona, I'm going

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.520 align:middle line:10%
to be taking students
out on a whale boat.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.520 align:middle line:10%
Because I went down two weeks
ago to do some reconnaissance.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:10%
One of my girlfriends
is a veterinarian,

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.820 align:middle line:10%
one of my students who's
now become a girlfriend,

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.140 align:middle line:10%
and she was having a
birthday party on Sunday

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.960 align:middle line:10%
and had invited 12 women
down for her birthday

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.362 align:middle line:10%
party on this whale boat.

00:38:07.362 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, I said to her, I don't
think they can wait that long.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they know
that I'm coming.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:14.410 align:middle line:10%
And I went down there on Friday,
and on Saturday, the whale

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.680 align:middle line:10%
said, sorry we can't wait.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.350 align:middle line:10%
We're here.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.004 align:middle line:10%
We're here now.

00:38:19.004 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:10%
We're waiting for you.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.430 align:middle line:10%
You have to come now.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:10%
And I said to the captain,
they're out there.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.530 align:middle line:10%
There are five of them.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.580 align:middle line:10%
And the matriarch of
the pod signaled me.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:10%
And I said, who are you with?

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.047 align:middle line:10%
And she said, well,
I'm with my son,

00:38:33.047 --> 00:38:34.380 align:middle line:10%
and then there are three others.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.255 align:middle line:10%
I said, who are they?

00:38:35.255 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:10%
She says, my sister
and her two children.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:10%
And they're huge, I mean, huge.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.010 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't sure if
they were orcas.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:10%
They were huge.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And I said to the
captain, they're here.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:10%
We got to go.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.720 align:middle line:10%
And thank heavens,
my student was

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.530 align:middle line:10%
so open minded she canceled
the birthday party.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.290 align:middle line:10%
She said we can't
wait until Sunday.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.740 align:middle line:10%
We gotta go now.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:10%
The captain throws me on
the boat, we go taking off.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.040 align:middle line:10%
Five fin whales
came out of nowhere

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.600 align:middle line:10%
and surrounded the boat.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.770 align:middle line:10%
So I'm sending out
is unconditional love

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.571 align:middle line:10%
on a silver platter, just
saying, I love you, I love you,

00:39:18.571 --> 00:39:19.070 align:middle line:10%
I love you.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I just can't wait to see you,
and visualizing what you do

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:90%
want.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:10%
Visualizing them
swimming toward the boat.

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.504 align:middle line:10%
You and I had that
conversation about dolphins

00:39:29.504 --> 00:39:30.670 align:middle line:10%
that didn't show up for you.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.253 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:31.253 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And I had
over 100 dolphins.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was waiting
for the dolphins,

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I was
visualizing was waiting.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:36.793 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: No.

00:39:36.793 --> 00:39:38.190 align:middle line:90%
You call the dolphins.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Hmm, so you called
them to come to you.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.320 align:middle line:90%
You asked them please come?

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.310 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: You visualize
what you do want.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.890 align:middle line:10%
You see them in your mind
swimming toward the boat.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.550 align:middle line:10%
You see them coming
closer and closer.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:10%
You see them so close.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.280 align:middle line:10%
I didn't even know
whales were this big,

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:10%
or could get this
close to the boat.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:02.136 align:middle line:10%
It was almost scary.

00:40:02.136 --> 00:40:03.510 align:middle line:10%
They could have
toppled the boat.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.800 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.590 align:middle line:10%
That's how big they were.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.850 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They
were under our boat.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.016 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And boats can't go
within a certain distance

00:40:08.016 --> 00:40:09.030 align:middle line:10%
to the animals.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.990 align:middle line:10%
You have to wait for
them to come to you.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:11.989 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:40:11.989 --> 00:40:20.110 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: But I'm inviting
them to come embrace my love.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm just there to love them.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm there to translate for them.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm there to be open.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm not coming with an agenda.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.810 align:middle line:10%
I don't say to, even the
show horse in the Olympics,

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:10%
I want you to do this.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:35.400 align:middle line:10%
I want you to do--
I don't do that.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:10%
I don't manipulate or
try to dominate them.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:10%
I say, I'm an ambassador
between species.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm here for you.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:10%
How can I help you?

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.050 align:middle line:10%
What do you want?

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.240 align:middle line:10%
What do you need?

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.390 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, what about the
whole Cesar Millan concept

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.240 align:middle line:10%
where you need to be
in charge of your dog

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:10%
and you need to
teach discipline.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.260 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: It's the same.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.490 align:middle line:10%
Because Cesar teaches
you are-- and that

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.580 align:middle line:10%
is energy in a dog suit.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:07.700 align:middle line:10%
You have to be the
source of their calm,

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.960 align:middle line:10%
be the source of
their peacefulness.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:10%
What alpha means: relaxed,
confident, and in charge.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.420 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm going to
say to the shark,

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.265 align:middle line:10%
I'm relaxed, confident,
and in charge.

00:41:20.265 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to be still and
wait for you to come to me.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.780 align:middle line:10%
And we'll do that
later with a cat,

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.480 align:middle line:10%
and you'll see
exactly what I mean.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:10%
The pack leader is always still.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:10%
Cesar is doing this.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.540 align:middle line:10%
He's visualizing
what he does want.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.277 align:middle line:10%
Now most people will visualize,
don't bite, don't bite.

00:41:39.277 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Right.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And the
dog goes, well, I

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.850 align:middle line:10%
don't know why she
wants me to bite.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Because they
just see the picture.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.808 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: She's showing me
the picture of me biting,

00:41:48.808 --> 00:41:51.090 align:middle line:10%
and her energy matches it.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.560 align:middle line:10%
The woman's going
to send the fear.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.935 align:middle line:10%
Oh, my dog attacks everybody,
and the dog's like, well, I

00:41:54.935 --> 00:41:57.120 align:middle line:10%
don't know why she wants
me to attack everybody,

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:10%
but I have to protect
her, because she's

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.390 align:middle line:10%
such an neurotic kook.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And if you're not that,
and if you're the opposite,

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:10%
you just say, relax
your body past this dog.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.690 align:middle line:10%
We're peaceful, we're
happy, we're confident.

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:10%
We're quiet.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:13.760 align:middle line:10%
We're loving.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.250 align:middle line:10%
We're together.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:10%
Everything, I don't care if
it's a tiger with a head that's

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.846 align:middle line:10%
this big, the tigers
will come over and go.

00:42:22.846 --> 00:42:24.010 align:middle line:10%
What's she doing?

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:25.650 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Is that what you do?

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those pictures
of you with the elephants

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.630 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, you embody that.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:33.410 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I always notice, and I
love Cesar's show, is he always

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:10%
winds up talking, of
course, to the adult

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:10%
or to the person who is
in the household with him.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to
call them the owners.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's where he
spends most of his time.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So for advice for
people who have

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:84%
animals who are
biting or attacking,

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.140 align:middle line:90%
what do you tell those people?

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.810 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They're mirroring
the people's energy.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.940 align:middle line:10%
Animals are going
to mirror to you

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.480 align:middle line:10%
what you least want to look at.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.200 align:middle line:10%
There's a Jungian concept
of what we've put in shadow.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.240 align:middle line:10%
What we put in shadow,
our animals will act out.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.970 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:13.020 align:middle line:10%
Whoa, so you have to be
really clear and really clean

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.440 align:middle line:10%
in your state of mind
in order for your animal

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.600 align:middle line:10%
to match that vibration.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.830 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: That's why they're
our greatest spiritual teacher.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.855 align:middle line:10%
Because if you get
upset and neurotic.

00:43:22.855 --> 00:43:24.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I can't
tell you how many

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.600 align:middle line:10%
cases I've done where I tune
into the dog or the cat,

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:10%
I hear the couple fighting.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I hear her on the phone
fighting with her mother.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I hear her screaming at her son.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.260 align:middle line:10%
So what happens, the
dog starts doing this.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.430 align:middle line:10%
The dog gets allergy problems.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.260 align:middle line:10%
The cat starts vomiting.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:10%
The cat is acting out.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.840 align:middle line:10%
The cat's frantic
and peeing where he

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.050 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't, or scratching
things that he shouldn't.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:52.490 align:middle line:10%
Because what's he going
to do with that energy?

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:54.330 align:middle line:10%
He's going to take
the negativity

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:56.310 align:middle line:10%
and try to process it.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:44:01.910 align:middle line:10%
If we bring them as much
beauty and peace as we can,

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.890 align:middle line:10%
that gives them
the space to have

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.860 align:middle line:10%
a happy home and a happy life.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I'm sure, I mean, if
you just try it, it would work.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And I know if I'm ever sick,
and if I'm at home in bed,

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I will have all four cats on
my body in about five minutes.

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Isn't
that interesting?

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're little healers,
and they just they understand,

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.370 align:middle line:84%
they know, and they come
and they just lay on me

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.100 align:middle line:90%
and heal me.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.280 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing animals.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.890 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get to meet
one of them in a minute.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yeah, I can't wait.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:30.558 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: I've got a
quick question for you

00:44:30.558 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:10%
about nine lives and cats.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.810 align:middle line:10%
What is that?

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:34.150 align:middle line:10%
Do they really have nine lives?

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.280 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what does that mean?

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.660 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: They really do.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:43.900 align:middle line:10%
Cats are one of the most
magical beings on this planet.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:50.670 align:middle line:10%
And they're able to access
realms of peace and dimensions

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:55.242 align:middle line:10%
of beauty that human beings
don't have access to.

00:44:55.242 --> 00:44:59.400 align:middle line:10%
And you might not know
when your husband's sick,

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.681 align:middle line:10%
the way your cat will
know when you're sick.

00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:03.180 align:middle line:10%
You might not wake
up in the morning

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.784 align:middle line:10%
and go, oh, his left
shoulder is sore.

00:45:05.784 --> 00:45:07.325 align:middle line:10%
But you'll look over
and the cat will

00:45:07.325 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:10%
be on that sore left shoulder.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.760 align:middle line:10%
She'll know.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.560 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Interesting,
very interesting.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.920 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And they do go into
these dimensions of healing.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:10%
They reinvent themselves,
and they come back

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.000 align:middle line:10%
with new vitality.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.940 align:middle line:10%
They're our healing and
meditation teachers.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.180 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, we have a
video of you communicating

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.714 align:middle line:10%
with the animals, and I want
you to take a look at this,

00:45:30.714 --> 00:45:32.130 align:middle line:10%
and when we come
back, we're going

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:36.580 align:middle line:10%
to learn how to communicate
with house pets.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.160 align:middle line:10%
And my daughter, Kayla's
going to be with us,

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:10%
and our friendly
housecat, Master Zen,

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.600 align:middle line:10%
is going to join us
as well in the studio.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.143 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at this video.

>>NARRATOR: Amelia
Kinkade is a real life Dr.

00:45:48.165 --> 00:45:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Doolittle, an
animal communicator.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Her ability to converse
with all living creatures

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.782 align:middle line:84%
has rated her one of the top
hundred psychics in the world.

00:45:56.782 --> 00:45:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: All animals
think in pictures.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.280 align:middle line:84%
The only species that's
isolated themselves

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.765 align:middle line:84%
from the communication that's
going on all over the world

00:46:03.765 --> 00:46:04.719 align:middle line:90%
is man.

00:46:04.719 --> 00:46:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE SPEAKER: So is
it like seeing movies

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.400 align:middle line:90%
or do you hear things?

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: It's a voice, but
it's not like a madman's voice.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not coming in
from the outside.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.810 align:middle line:90%
It's welling up from the inside.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Did you see a toy?

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There's a red and
yellow striped-- it's a crab,

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.870 align:middle line:90%
and it has all these legs.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:27.584 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: You said
a red and yellow bug?

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.900 align:middle line:84%
When you move into
using intuition,

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel and
sense and see everything.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.470 align:middle line:84%
You smell things, you taste
things, you see things.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.970 align:middle line:10%
And it might not
all happen at once.

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:44.840 align:middle line:10%
You might get a
glimpse of a vision,

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:10%
not know what you're looking at.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:49.570 align:middle line:10%
You might hear a word, and
not know what it relates to.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:54.890 align:middle line:10%
All right, I got a big one
real loud, real strong.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Ask her what her
boyfriend looks like.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Amelia
discovered her own gift

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.790 align:middle line:10%
15 years ago in a
workshop like this one

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:03.460 align:middle line:10%
she held in Johannesburg.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.890 align:middle line:84%
At the time, she was an
actress in Hollywood,

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.860 align:middle line:84%
now her clients are
the pets of the stars.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.775 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I stumbled into
this completely by accident.

00:47:11.775 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the beauties
of what I now teach

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.620 align:middle line:84%
is that I didn't have
any knowledge of animal

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.510 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I certainly didn't think
that I was capable of it.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And I went into that
workshop thinking

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd be the last person in
the world who could do it.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I discovered
that I could do it,

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:30.195 align:middle line:84%
then I discovered that
everyone can do it.

00:47:30.195 --> 00:47:32.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: All right, now
joining me in studio

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:36.890 align:middle line:10%
is Kayla, my daughter,
and our little house cat,

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:40.290 align:middle line:10%
Zen, Master Zen, who this
is her first time on camera,

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:44.250 align:middle line:10%
both of you, and Amelia.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:49.070 align:middle line:10%
So Zen's obviously curious
about what's going on.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.970 align:middle line:84%
She's about 13, 12
or 13 years old.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:84%
We recently, we saved
her little life.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:58.390 align:middle line:84%
She went through a
pretty traumatic surgery

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:03.490 align:middle line:84%
where she swallowed something,
and it lacerated her tummy

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.940 align:middle line:90%
about six months ago.

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: OK, now
Lisa, first of all,

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I can't scold you
on your own show,

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.180 align:middle line:84%
but what you just
did is you told

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.660 align:middle line:90%
me negative things about her.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: And her age.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I were introducing you,
that would be like me saying,

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:29.700 align:middle line:10%
this is my friend, Lisa, she's
49, and she has PMS today,

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.144 align:middle line:10%
and she's gained 15 pounds
in the last two weeks.

00:48:33.144 --> 00:48:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And she keeps fighting
with her husband.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
wrong with her.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:38.793 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You've got
a good point there.

00:48:38.793 --> 00:48:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: So we don't
mention age of female cats.

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And we don't say
anything negative

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.059 align:middle line:90%
about her body or her past.

00:48:47.059 --> 00:48:49.225 align:middle line:84%
We don't say anything
negative about her in any way.

00:48:49.225 --> 00:48:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm sorry, sweetie.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:50.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: So now what we do
know, is that she's a TV star.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.040 align:middle line:10%
She's the mother of
this entire family.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.980 align:middle line:10%
She keeps everybody together,
even though she was not

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:05.760 align:middle line:10%
allowed to have a family
of kittens of her own.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.760 align:middle line:10%
So she considers you
all to be her children.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.050 align:middle line:10%
But when we open with
that wave of love,

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:18.630 align:middle line:10%
now if you could envision that
your chest is like a star.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:20.690 align:middle line:10%
And you're a shining star.

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.040 align:middle line:10%
You've got rays of starlight
coming out of your chest

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.690 align:middle line:10%
and out of your back.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to connect
to her, all you have to do

comfortable she is?

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:47.840 align:middle line:10%
And in that quiet,
there's nothing but love.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.372 align:middle line:10%
She's purring in admiration.

00:49:49.372 --> 00:49:52.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to tell her that
she's the most beautiful cat

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.358 align:middle line:10%

00:49:55.358 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:10%
>>KAYLA: You're the
most beautiful cat

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.840 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And
permission to pet would

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.660 align:middle line:10%
be to wait for her to touch
her nose to your hand.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.570 align:middle line:10%
Now she's done it already,
before we got her out

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.380 align:middle line:10%
of the carrier.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.110 align:middle line:10%
So it's unlikely that
she'll do it again.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.230 align:middle line:10%
But that's how you
say, hello, then you're

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:18.820 align:middle line:10%
allowed to touch only the top
of her head and under here.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:22.450 align:middle line:10%
And if you want her
to completely relax,

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:25.230 align:middle line:10%
you hum a little
love song, and it's

00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:27.780 align:middle line:10%
going to mirror
her mother's purr.

That's an important lesson.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:50.980 align:middle line:10%
It's a very important lesson.

>>KINKADE: But people do
that on a regular basis

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.452 align:middle line:10%
with their animals.

00:50:54.452 --> 00:50:56.785 align:middle line:10%
Every time they introduce me
to the animal, they'll say,

00:50:56.785 --> 00:50:59.045 align:middle line:10%
oh, she's blind in one eye,
and she's got diabetes,

00:50:59.045 --> 00:51:04.210 align:middle line:10%
and she's limping,
and I'm like, no.

Let's talk about what
we love about her.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.220 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about what's
beautiful about her.

>>LISA: You taught me, or I
learned on one of your videos

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:18.500 align:middle line:10%
that when cats blink slowly,
that's a sign of love.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: It's a
calming signal, which

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:25.530 align:middle line:84%
is how they say hello,
and it means, greetings,

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I love you in cat language.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She did that.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.260 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And it's a
two blinker process.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So you blink, and
then she blinks.

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you blink again,
and she blinks again.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.430 align:middle line:10%
Then she'll either lick
her lips, or she'll yawn.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.810 align:middle line:10%
And they also do
this in the wild.

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:47.140 align:middle line:84%
This is how you would call
a lion to your safari truck.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:48.720 align:middle line:10%
I slow blink her.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.910 align:middle line:10%
I wait for her to slow blink me.

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:53.380 align:middle line:10%
I really slow blink you.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.000 align:middle line:10%
I really love you.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.290 align:middle line:10%
And she'll go, oh, this
person can speak cat.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:03.050 align:middle line:10%
And then the lion will yawn, and
then they'll pose for pictures.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.830 align:middle line:84%
They'll go, oh, did you
see my good side darling?

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, do you get this side?

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:11.150 align:middle line:10%
And then if you just
sit there in silence--

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:15.030 align:middle line:10%
I don't let people take
pictures right off the bat.

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:18.360 align:middle line:10%
The lions get up,
and they walk over

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.220 align:middle line:10%

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Hippos come over.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:39.110 align:middle line:10%
I had a baby hippo follow me
back to my chalet the last time

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.070 align:middle line:10%
I was in Zambia.

She trusts you.

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:10.390 align:middle line:90%
So you're not making noise.

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:11.390 align:middle line:90%
You're not on the phone.

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:12.348 align:middle line:90%
You're not watching TV.

00:53:12.348 --> 00:53:13.650 align:middle line:90%
You're not on the computer.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:17.575 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to be with
her, and ask her about her day,

00:53:17.575 --> 00:53:19.050 align:middle line:90%
or about her history.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.470 align:middle line:84%

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We got two rescue

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well,
let's say that you

inside her body, you're
looking out her eyes.

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to
visualize one of those cats

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:47.025 align:middle line:84%
walks into the room, but--
this is called Gestalt.

00:53:47.025 --> 00:53:49.270 align:middle line:90%
This is a very advanced Gestalt.

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.840 align:middle line:84%

that she would go over and pet
them instead of petting me.

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Like, they come up, and they
steal my spot sometimes.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Oh.

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Now that's exactly what I got.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.910 align:middle line:84%
When I went into that
situation in her body,

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I felt this tension, I
felt my stomach clench up.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I felt a territorial
battle, like, oh, they're

She's threatened by them.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:46.700 align:middle line:10%
You need to tell her, you're

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: You say

It's their territory.

I've brought some
new kittens for you.

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.270 align:middle line:10%
They're not for me.

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.070 align:middle line:10%
They're for you.

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:10%
Would you please teach
them the house rules?

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:23.100 align:middle line:10%
Would you please take over
and be in charge of them?

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.180 align:middle line:10%
So that she's dominant.

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.680 align:middle line:10%
She's not going to compete
with those cats for attention.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.210 align:middle line:10%
You're giving those cats to her.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:33.590 align:middle line:10%
Say they're your cats.

>>KINKADE: They are

Cats live in colonies, and

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:47.130 align:middle line:10%
And chances are, if

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we throw up our hands and
say, there's nothing we can do.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's so terrible.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cry.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.070 align:middle line:90%
I can't go into this situation.

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you can't be that
agent of peace and power

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:11.781 align:middle line:90%
that God created you to be.

00:57:11.781 --> 00:57:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Your job
is to go in there

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, the
humans have hurt you.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you're in pain.

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.410 align:middle line:10%
I love you, and I'm
here for you now.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:22.260 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And you're in
a safe place with me,

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.780 align:middle line:10%
and I can make you feel safe.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.550 align:middle line:10%
We've learned so
much, and I thank

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:27.200 align:middle line:10%
you so much for being here.

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.340 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Oh, and I'm
going to give you-- this

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:33.100 align:middle line:10%
is my first illustrated
children's novel.

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.020 align:middle line:10%
And this one is about
a little girl who's

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:39.350 align:middle line:10%
12 years old who
looks a lot like you,

00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:43.305 align:middle line:10%
and she learns how to
communicate with animals.

00:57:43.305 --> 00:57:45.960 align:middle line:10%
It's a fantasy story.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's wonderful.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Amelia.

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAYLA: Thank you.

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you
so much, Amelia.

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing such
incredible work in the world.

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:55.630 align:middle line:84%
The very first book
you had was, "Straight

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:56.690 align:middle line:90%
from the Horse's Mouth."

00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:58.966 align:middle line:84%
That was her first book,
really great, great books.

00:57:58.966 --> 00:58:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And this is one
of my other latest ones.

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:04.060 align:middle line:84%
This is "Soul Mates with
Paws, Hooves, and Wings."

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's just love stories
about how animals can teach us

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:14.120 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of wisdom about life
and laughter, and love and joy,

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and even the fact that there's
no such thing as death.

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:21.550 align:middle line:10%
Some people get
appearances of animals

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:24.750 align:middle line:10%
after they've crossed
the Rainbow Bridge when

00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:27.600 align:middle line:10%
they haven't gotten any
messages from humans

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.890 align:middle line:10%
when they've passed away.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.598 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: They're very
clear communicators.

00:58:30.598 --> 00:58:33.830 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: But they do get
messages from their animals.

00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:36.920 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, it shows
how clear animals are,

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.400 align:middle line:10%
and how easy it
is to communicate

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.000 align:middle line:10%
with animals and
with humans, as well.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.070 align:middle line:90%
You've been amazing.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Amelia.

00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, Kayla,
for being with me.

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KAYLA: You're welcome.

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.510 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: Can I
be your cat sitter?

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:52.410 align:middle line:10%
I want to be her
fairy godmother.

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:54.650 align:middle line:10%
I think we're in love now.

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and thank
you, Zen, for being a star.

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KAYLA: She says
you're welcome.

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And thank you so much
for being a part of this.

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I hope that you learned
as much as I did.

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:06.540 align:middle line:84%

interview with Amelia Kinkade,
