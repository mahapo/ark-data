00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hello and welcome.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:84%
After you see the images
that you are about to see

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the concepts
that are revealed,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
you will look at
life differently.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely did, and that's
exactly what happened to me.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.816 align:middle line:84%
The question is what are
you willing to do about it?

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
discussing today.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a very
unconventional documentary

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
called "THRIVE," and
it's both educational

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.100 align:middle line:90%
and very inspirational.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And joining me are the
filmmakers Foster Gamble

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and Kimberly Carter Gamble.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining me,
and thank you for the film.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Really, thank you for the film.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean that.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing what
you've put into it.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.255 align:middle line:84%
How long did it take
you to make this film?

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:55.564 align:middle line:84%
>>FOSTER GAMBLE: I'll let
the producer go for that.

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMBERLY CARTER GAMBLE: It
too us eight years, actually.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
It took us eight
years to put together,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:84%
the website and the
film, because they really

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:90%
do go together.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.385 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of the
greatest aspects,

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and I think is a guest in
itself, is the graphics.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.382 align:middle line:90%
The graphics are phenomenal.

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be showing clips

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.381 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire
show, so you're

00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
see this, but that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
must have taken teams
to put together.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.662 align:middle line:84%
And how much-- how many
teams did you have on this?

00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, we had a
wonderful special effects

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
team from Ashland, Oregon,
called Liquid Buddha Studios.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Goa Lobaugh and
his team up there.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And they were the primary ones
for the 3D computer graphics.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.541 align:middle line:84%
And then we had some
other people, as well,

00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:36.541 align:middle line:84%
doing some of the 2D
animations that you'll see.

00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:38.582 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's really a
combination of visionaries,

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
though, that you
needed to put this

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
together, between the visuals
and your concepts and so forth.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So how long-- first of
all, the movie "THRIVE"

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:84%
is about, in a nutshell,
if you could give it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.048 align:middle line:84%
to me in a nutshell--
we're going to see clips,

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:90%
but what is it about?

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: The title is "THRIVE,
What on Earth Will it Take?"

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's really an exploration
into what is in the way

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:84%
of human beings' and our
planet's natural drive

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:90%
to thrive.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And if we could figure
out what's in the way,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
then we get a handle on how
to eliminate that and let

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.880 align:middle line:84%
that natural life
impulse come out.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What caused you to ask
those questions in your life?

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, for me,
from a very young age, when

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:90%
I look back, I was a peacemaker.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I was breaking up fights
in elementary school

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and I could see how people
weren't communicating, weren't

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
understanding each
other, and so forth.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And as that grew
over time, I realized

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that the media was a
really powerful tool

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:84%
for not only informing
people, but also having people

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.705 align:middle line:84%
see each other's points
of view and resolving

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the conflicts that
really have us

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:84%
at the threat of
annihilating life

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:90%
as we know it on the planet.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you have
been a peacemaker

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
in your previous
professions as well where

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
you were a mediator,
was that what--?

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.834 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: I taught communication
and conflict resolution,

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and worked with companies in
Silicon Valley for many years

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:90%
doing that.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And prior to that I taught
the non-violent martial art

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:90%
of aikido for 15 years.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So, the latter work was
really an application

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.869 align:middle line:84%
in interpersonal--
where the battles really

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
take place of what I've
been studying on the mat.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Isn't it
amazing when you

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
have a purpose on this
planet that you're here

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:84%
to do, you can't do anything
other than fulfill it?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.799 align:middle line:84%
When it's really
that true purpose.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE:
And when it's clear.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And getting clear about that
is a big part of the task.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think a
big part of our intention

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
behind "THRIVE" was
to kind of unpack

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:84%
a combination of two things
that have been really

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:84%
important in my
life, having to do

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
with the combination
of passionate intent

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and unconflicted behavior.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.664 align:middle line:84%
Because what I have found
is that passionate intent

00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
is actually a lot
easier to muster

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:90%
than unconflicted behavior.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So for us, the motivation and
the process of making "THRIVE"

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
was really how can-- There
are so many people who care

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and who are working
in one way or another

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.162 align:middle line:84%
to help solve the
problems on this planet.

00:03:59.162 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Millions.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Millions
of people are working,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and yet, things have been
continuing to get worse.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, it was
looking at how can we

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
help clarify-- I'll give an
example of conflicted behavior

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
in my own life that sort
of led to this, which was,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
when I was in college I
was working to stop coal

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and nuclear power projects,
which I thought were dangerous.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So, my ritual was that
I would finish work

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
on Fridays-- we'd have
meetings every other week--

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I would drive to the meeting
across town from my house.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would, on my way,
stop at Bank of America

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and deposit my paycheck.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Then I would go to the meeting.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't
understand at the time

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
that banks use their
customers' deposits

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to make loans to corporations
so that the corporations can

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.324 align:middle line:90%
fund their projects.

00:04:48.324 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't think
most of us realize that.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.198 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Well,
in fact, Bank of America

00:04:52.198 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:84%
was using my deposits to fund
the exact same corporations

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that I was, otherwise
then, trying to stop.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's conflicted behavior.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.605 align:middle line:84%
And we had an opportunity
to do the study

00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and kind of get into it.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And so a big part of the
intention for "THRIVE"

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:84%
is that, on the website
and in the movie,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
it's to help us
understand how can we

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle line:84%
align our passionate
intent, which so many have,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
with unconflicted behavior
so that we actually

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
get the results that
we're aiming for.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.046 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's
definitely not designed

00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:23.759 align:middle line:84%
for us to understand
that at all.

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the beauty
is about your film, is

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:84%
it really clearly
and graphically,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
it explains and illustrates
how the connections are all

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:84%
led around the control
of an elite few.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And we've heard about
the 99% versus the 1,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:84%
but this really
explains it in detail,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
which is-- I'm very,
very grateful for.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.184 align:middle line:84%
And before you did this
movie, you were a journalist?

00:05:46.184 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Yes, I was.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.806 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Yeah.

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I mean, everything
that I've ever done,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I think, led to what I brought
to bear it in "THRIVE."

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.970 align:middle line:84%
In particular, I think
the tone of the movie,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that we really
wanted to focus on solutions,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and that we also really
wanted the website

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to be there as a
tool for people to do

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:90%
their own further exploration.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is so
well thought out.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate you saying that
because I see a lot of DVDs,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and there are-- 99% of the
DVD is problem and pain.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I look throughout the
whole DVD for the solution,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and there's, maybe, the last
10 minutes as an afterthought.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And you focus the entire
second half on solutions

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:90%
because that's what we need.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.292 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all, most
of it is about awareness.

00:06:34.292 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the clip here.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a kind of an overview
of the movie and how it got

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%
There are some
images in here that

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.200 align:middle line:90%
are hard hitting but important.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.654 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

of the greatest wonders of all,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
how a tiny egg and a single,
irrepressibly plucky sperm

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
can unleash a process

in the end, another one of
us, a being of vast ability

If nature teaches
us anything, it

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
is that life is meant to work,

life is not about thriving;
it's about surviving,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%

Is this really the
best we can do?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Did the universe labor for
nearly 14 billion years only to

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:84%
bring forth a species
that would end up

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
as an enemy to life itself

trying to figure
out what happened.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
that could account

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:84%
for the staggering agony and

As a young man,
driven by the misery

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I saw and by my fear
for our survival,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I set out on a journey
seeking to answer questions

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:84%
like is it even possible
for humans to thrive?

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
If so, why aren't we?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
My research led me to places
I never expected to go,

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
revealing surprising discoveries
that seemed unrelated at first,

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
but which turned out to
be crucially connected,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:90%
as you'll see.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I found a code, a
pattern in nature

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that's been embedded in arts and
icons throughout the centuries.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe this
code holds the key

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to a new source of clean,
sustainable energy that

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:84%
could completely revolutionize
the way all people live.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I came to understand how our
economic system is rigged.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And I found out what
we can do about it.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:84%
My journey revealed ways
we can claim our power

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
to create liberating, healthy
systems everywhere on earth.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I have realized that
we are not a mistake.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:90%
We are simply mistaken.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.110 align:middle line:84%
We've been blinded
to our brilliance,

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
shorn of our strength,
ignorant of our genius,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:84%
unaware of our true
power and magnificence.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:90%

how many layers there

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:90%
were in that particular clip.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You have touched on so
many things in this DVD.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So, I want to start
out in the beginning

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
where you talked about the
energy, the torus energy,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and how that can, in and of
itself, provide free energy

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
to the entire globe, which I
find difficult to understand.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, this is the
kind of core excitement,

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
to me, of the whole
quest that I've

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:90%
been on for the last 50 years.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if the universe
had a blueprint

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
for building healthy,
sustainable systems.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if, in
fact, it was everywhere

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
we looked if we only
knew how to see it.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And it turns out that it does.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:84%
This torus, this donut-shaped
whirlpool vortex,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is the only system
which sustains itself

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:90%
in a continuous medium.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really big clue
given that our struggle

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
to survive is how do we create
a sustainable civilization,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.934 align:middle line:84%
sustainable economics,
sustainable access to energy--

00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%

>>GAMBLE: --sustainable
agriculture, everything?

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out, if you
recognize this toroidal form,

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.254 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that it is
the pattern of wholeness,

00:10:51.254 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
then we can take apart what
are the principles, what

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.700 align:middle line:90%
are the aspects of that?

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And we can then apply
it in agriculture,

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:84%
we can apply it in
medicine, we can apply it

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
in how to access energy in a
clean, free, sorta feminine,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:84%
blending way rather
than crashing things,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.819 align:middle line:84%
making explosions, and
trying to control them.

00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: I just want
to say one thing about it,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
too, because the
thing about the torus,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of
free energy, is

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:19.710 align:middle line:84%
that, in addition to it being a
new concept of abundance, which

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I think shifts-- You
know, worldview is often

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
determined most
of all by science.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, to have a whole
different scientific paradigm

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
of what's possible
is significant.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to that,
just on a human level,

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
when you see the amount
of pain and suffering

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that's related to energy
and the access to energy,

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
it's really-- it has to
do with whether or not

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
you have clean water,
whether or not you have heat,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
whether or not you
have hospital care.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not there are
wars all over the place

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:84%
fought in the name of energy,
so-- and our environment.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It has so many human,
earthly ramifications that,

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
as intriguing and interesting
as it is sort of scientifically,

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.715 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really important
to ground it in the impact

00:12:00.715 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that something
like that can have

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.852 align:middle line:84%
in billions of lives
all over the planet.

00:12:03.852 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:84%

the things you just mentioned

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:90%
are connected.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
We look at them as individual
problems in society,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and that they're separated
out, and whereas they're all

connected.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.306 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that really does

00:12:15.306 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
connect them is this
toroidal energy, which

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:90%
I had not heard of before.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a clip in the movie--
a scientist, Duane Elgin,

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:90%
talks about this.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%

it gives a great illustration--

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%

as to what this is about.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.934 align:middle line:90%

-Evolution means two
to unfold, to roll out.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So the question is what is
the universe rolling out?

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And what the universe is rolling
out is self-organizing systems.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
this at every scale.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:84%
A self-organizing system
is a technical term

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
for just a system
getting ahold of itself,

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:90%
knowing itself, essentially.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we go to
nature, we can look

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and we can see these
self-organizing forms

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:90%
throughout.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
We can see it in
the cross section

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
of an orange, the cross
section of an apple.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We can see it in the
dynamic nature of a tornado.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
We can see it in
the magnetic field

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.360 align:middle line:84%
around the earth, a
similar magnetic field

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.430 align:middle line:90%
around an individual.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
We can see it in the structure
of an entire whirlpool galaxy.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:84%
We can see it in the
structure of a small atom.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
At every scale, throughout
its entire history,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.050 align:middle line:84%
the universe has
one, single project.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:90%
It's growing toruses.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.657 align:middle line:84%

So, in understanding

else in the universe

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
now that other

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:90%
to see the value of it, as well.

And yes, it's there.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Our entire body is made up
of these atoms and cells,

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
each of which are in
these toroidal forms.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:84%
A torus is a continuous surface
with a hole in the middle.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So our body is actually
a physical torus.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It's surrounded by
an energetic torus.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
an emotional torus.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.060 align:middle line:84%

of a strange perspective.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:84%
But then if you actually stand
back and look at it that way,

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:84%
rather than seeing all
these separate objects,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:84%
if we're a continuous sea
of energy, or consciousness,

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
or love, or whatever term
you want to give to it,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
then the division becomes only--
or multiplication becomes only

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:90%
by division of the wholeness.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So the wholeness
becomes atoms, divides

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:56.574 align:middle line:84%
into atoms, which becomes
molecules, and cells, and all

00:14:56.574 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:90%
of life as we know it.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you realize
that all of those

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:84%
are just fractal holograms in
this one continuous pattern,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.210 align:middle line:84%
always centered by
absolute stillness,

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and infused with
consciousness, then we're

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:84%
living in a world of
infinite abundance.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's a whole
different reality

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
than this separate, not
enough to go around, I'm

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.975 align:middle line:84%
different from you type of world
that we've been trained in.

00:15:17.975 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The idea is how to
make that practical, how

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:90%
to bring that into reality.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:84%
How does that actually
work in our lives, which

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.766 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see
in just a second.

00:15:25.766 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting
that you even

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:84%
ask that question of how would
we have a sustainable energy

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And whereas, it relates to from
the galaxy all the way down

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:84%
to the tiniest atom, and
that there's a through line.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:84%
How did you even think to
ask that type of question?

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.103 align:middle line:84%
I know that you were raised
in the family from the Procter

00:15:45.103 --> 00:15:48.172 align:middle line:84%
& Gamble family, and this
was your grandfather was--

00:15:48.172 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Great,
great grandfather.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.004 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Great,
great grandfather.

00:15:51.004 --> 00:15:53.504 align:middle line:84%
How did you begin to ask those
questions based on the family

00:15:53.504 --> 00:15:54.628 align:middle line:90%
or upbringing that you had?

00:15:54.628 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, those are two
kind of separate questions

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:84%
because I was not aware of
that whole family aspect

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:84%
when I was already
asking these questions.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:90%
I was a troublemaker.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I did well in
school, but in kindergarten,

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was already
asking the questions

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:84%
that adults usually tell
you to be quiet about.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to high school
and started studying physics,

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:84%
it was not OK with me
to not ask the question,

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.010 align:middle line:84%
is well, if the universe
is 15 billion years

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.927 align:middle line:84%
across-- light years across--
well, what's it floating in?

00:16:22.927 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Well my physics teachers
didn't want to talk about that.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.355 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd
say, well, the atom

00:16:26.355 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental
building block.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well OK,
what's it made up of?

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't talk about that.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And so, I've always
been interested in kind

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:84%
of the questions that lead to
a dropping of the boundaries

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and experience of the
interconnectedness.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's been throughout.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.795 align:middle line:84%
Then, in answer to your
question about the family,

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I would-- my parents were,
actually, really wonderful,

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:90%
humble people.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:90%
We lived rather modestly.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was an incredibly
unconditionally loving person,

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and my dad was a kind
of a traditional lawyer,

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and he was known
for his integrity.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't realize
how blessed I

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
was to have that kind of
family that I grew up in.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
later, in college,

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.989 align:middle line:84%
that I started becoming more
aware of there's this Procter

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
& Gamble thing because I started
becoming aware that I was going

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.736 align:middle line:84%
to inherit some money from my
grandparents, which was really

00:17:18.736 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:90%
good news, you know.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:21.402 align:middle line:84%
It turned out I was
going to be able to make

00:17:21.402 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
some decisions that everybody
would love to be able to make.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
they're easy decisions,

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:90%
but I was blessed with the time.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't inherit a
tremendous amount of money,

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:84%
but enough that I could actually
decide what to do with my life

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and help some other
people as I went along

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:90%
if I managed it carefully.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, in relation
to the company itself,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll always be
grateful for that.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And the company
itself started out

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
as a very highly
respectable company

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:90%
making soap and candles.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And as it grew to a
multinational corporation,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
then there were people who
came on the board of directors,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and major investors,
and so forth,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:84%
who took it the way of the usual
military-industrial complex,

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Fortune 500 companies.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been,
frankly, proud

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
of the activities
of the company, what

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
they've been doing
for a long time.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
My own family
hasn't been involved

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
in the running of the company
for at least three generations.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And our entire clan
has minuscule holdings

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:90%
in the company.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have influence
other than that if we go public

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:84%
on something we can embarrass
them a little bit, which

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.542 align:middle line:90%
we've been doing for many years.

00:18:26.542 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:84%
For instance, about
animal testing,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:90%
and got that reduced over 90%.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been very
successful in terms

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
of getting them to create
more organic products.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:84%
We've had limited
success in terms

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
of them cleaning
up the pollution.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, it's a mixed bag.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.852 align:middle line:84%
And one friend of
mine said, well,

00:18:45.852 --> 00:18:48.185 align:middle line:84%
you should just tell people
you're an ancestor of Ivory.

00:18:48.185 --> 00:18:51.372 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.372 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it's useful for us
to be aware of our heritage,

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's up
to each one of us

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
to choose what we do
with our own lives

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:90%
and, frankly, with our own money

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's interesting.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.289 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it from
an outsider's perspective

00:19:02.289 --> 00:19:06.527 align:middle line:84%
over here, where you have
the-- you are the microcosm.

00:19:06.527 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:90%
And that is the macrocosm.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at your life, you

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
are here making an
impact and a difference

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
in companies like those to
bring awareness to all of us--

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:84%
it's very apropos that
you are both involved

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and on the outside
of that company.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.682 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective,
it makes perfect sense.

00:19:26.682 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.348 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, it's
useful, particularly

00:19:29.348 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
with the whole new occupy
lingo, and so forth,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's really
important to distinguish.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It's too easy to talk
about the 1% and the 99%.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll see, as we go
on in this interview,

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and for those people
who have seen "THRIVE,"

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's really
critical to understand

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:84%
the 0.0001% who are
actually using money

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.419 align:middle line:84%
to try to destroy billions
of lives versus people

00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
who've made their money
in a reputable way.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at what
point does someone

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.652 align:middle line:84%
like a Steve Jobs or an Oprah
turn into an evil person

00:19:58.652 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
because they've made a
certain amount of money?

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.109 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
make sense, and it's

00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
going to create the
next us versus them.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Whereas integrity, and
honesty, and compassion,

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
those types of things can be
really facilitated with money

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:84%
if it's not being used
to rip people off.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.106 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Yeah.

00:20:14.106 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think another thing
that comes from the privilege,

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
that we've been afforded
to have the time, which

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:90%
really is what we got.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
We got time so that-- so many
people ask the questions,

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and then they have to go
to work the next morning.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:84%
We got to make our work be
following up on the questions,

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.559 align:middle line:84%
well, what about
this, and well, so,

00:20:33.559 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:90%
where did that money come from?

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.225 align:middle line:84%
And let's follow
that over there.

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a huge amount
of time following

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.435 align:middle line:84%
the money in that way that if
the story doesn't make sense

00:20:40.435 --> 00:20:41.310 align:middle line:90%
you follow the money.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing,
I think, that we got

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle line:84%
was a personal experience
in having enough.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what
we got to experience,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and which we actually
base a lot of our thinking

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
in the solutions on is,
when you have enough,

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
our experience is that
it's actually very natural

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to want to do anything you can
for everyone to have enough.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To help others.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: That's
just what happens.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The only reason that
anyone isn't doing that

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
is because they're concerned
about their own survival.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, we've had the
personal experience

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of seeing how natural
it is to devote our time

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and energy on behalf of
making it so other people can

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:90%
have a chance to thrive also.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.659 align:middle line:84%
And I just believe that
that is human nature,

00:21:22.659 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:90%
that people will do that.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's fantastic,
too, that you're not

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.030 align:middle line:90%
in that survival.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:84%
You're able to ask
the bigger questions

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and bring the information to us,
who are in a little survival.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.251 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at this next clip

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:90%
explains the toroidal energy.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fascinating concept.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a great clip that
shows exactly what you're

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
You're able to bring us
these bigger perspectives,

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and this shows a little
bit more about the energy,

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.040 align:middle line:90%
the torus energy.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.984 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:21:51.984 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:84%
-A modern day
inventor, Adam Trombly,

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:84%
was inspired by Tesla's work
and by the possibilities

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:90%
of the torus.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Trombly built a dynamo, a
direct current generator

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
that accessed electrical
power right out of the air.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.360 align:middle line:84%
-We were trying to
demonstrate that by mimicking

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field of the
planet and rotating this device,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
we could actually create
a dynamo that would work.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it did
work, and it does work.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.225 align:middle line:84%
So when we contemplate nature,
when we contemplate Jupiter,

00:22:23.225 --> 00:22:25.767 align:middle line:84%
or we contemplate a dynamo like
the Earth rotating in space,

00:22:25.767 --> 00:22:27.600 align:middle line:84%
we're basically talking
about a magnet which

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:84%
is rotating in space, and the
lines of flux of the magnet

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
are pouring down in through
in this toroidal pattern

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:90%
of the magnetic field.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
It's also expanding
and contracting.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It's breathing.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:84%
It's taking in the
energy of space,

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:90%
literally, and transforming it.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Right here in this toroid,
we have enough energy

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:90%
to transform the entire earth.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.495 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just a
theoretical statement.

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:90%
It's literally true.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:84%
To contemplate the
implications of this

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
means that every single place
on earth suddenly has power.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Every single person on
earth suddenly has power.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:90%
We have universal abundance.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:84%
-Trombly had been
invited to demonstrate

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:84%
one of his generators at the
United Nations and the US

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Senate.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But these events were
undermined by the first Bush

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:90%
administration.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Then the device itself was
taken in a government raid.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Trombly's experience
isn't unique.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Almost every time
I found an inventor

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:84%
with a promising new technology
in the field of free energy,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:84%
he told a similar
story of suppression.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Inventor John
Bedini begin working

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
with Tesla's theories of
radiant energy decades ago,

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and has produced an assortment
of battery charging devices

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:84%
that generate more energy
than it takes to run them.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
He announced that he was
going to start offering them

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.650 align:middle line:90%
at low cost.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Soon after that, he
was attacked in his lab

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and warned not to
produce the devices.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
For his own safety,
he had to let

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:90%
go of marketing free energy.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.990 align:middle line:90%

to to several different people

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:84%
that created free
energy like that?

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.924 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Of the
laboratories that I've

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:90%
that has happened.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And you read throughout
the history of ever

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
since Nikola Tesla
almost 100 years ago,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:84%
this has happened again
and again and again.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:84%
The US Patent Office
has confiscated

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
over 2,000-- the estimates
that I've heard recently

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.655 align:middle line:84%
are 5,000 alternative
energy patents.

00:24:30.655 --> 00:24:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what's the
explanation for something

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.809 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Hasn't anyone ever
challenged that?

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, they
do it on two bases.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:84%
One, they say, anything that
looks like a perpetual motion

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.750 align:middle line:90%
machine can't be true.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.149 align:middle line:84%
And so, they'll just--
they won't issue a patent.

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're not allowed to
continue on the device because

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
of the second reason,
which is in the interests

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:90%
of national security.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well,
it means, I think,

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that if someone were to
have a free energy device,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:84%
they might be able to
make it be very dangerous,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
or propel rockets at speeds,
or fighter jets at speeds

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.099 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't contain,
or something like that.

00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
there's a story that

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.181 align:middle line:84%
makes a lot more
sense than that one.

00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:15.782 align:middle line:84%
Because our national security,
I think, is most at risk right

00:25:15.782 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
now because of the wars that
were fighting, where thousands

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
of young people are losing
their lives in our own military,

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:84%
not to mention millions
of innocent civilians

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:84%
in these other
countries, fighting

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.476 align:middle line:84%
over oil, which we don't need
if we let these devices out.

00:25:29.476 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And, they're
polluting the skies,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and causing asthma,
and all that thing.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we need to
step back and look at, well OK,

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
what is a story that would
make sense out of all this?

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.290 align:middle line:90%
I imagine we'll get into that.

00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:84%

of these devices

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.780 align:middle line:84%
anywhere that have
been marketed,

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.877 align:middle line:84%
or are in any place in
our sectors, anywhere?

00:25:49.877 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%

there are none on the market

We'd all be hearing about it
very rapidly if they were.

00:25:55.135 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:90%

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GAMBLE: Yes.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE:
Oh yeah, they work.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:84%
We've both had an
opportunity to see them.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And once you see them, then--
people can say what they say,

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.290 align:middle line:84%
but it's absolutely the
case that they exist.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And they create
energy within themselves,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.699 align:middle line:84%
non-combustible energy
within themselves?

00:26:09.699 --> 00:26:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well the key is that
when we get up in the morning,

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.096 align:middle line:84%
we don't plug into
the wall socket

00:26:14.096 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:90%
in order to get our energy.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:90%
We are energy devices.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And we are in a sea
of infinite energy.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So the key is rather than
exploding things in order

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to access that energy, what
if we do what women are so

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
good at, is blending and leading
and seeing what nature does,

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:84%
which is it spirals in these
toroidal forms and dances,

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And then to create a device
which mimics that dance.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And then tune it like
you would a guitar,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and at certain
octave frequencies--

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:84%
It's different with various
devices, depending on materials

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, but
basically, you'd

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:84%
come into resonance with the
field of energy that you're in,

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.501 align:middle line:84%
and it starts pouring out
clean, abundant electricity.

00:26:56.501 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Unlimited.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:58.166 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Yeah.

00:26:58.166 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
it, when you see it,

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.320 align:middle line:90%
is that-- well, two things.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:84%
One is it's a white light;
it's a cold, white light.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not hot, yellow
electricity that we're used to.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a whole
different feel to it.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you plug into
it, actually, more energy

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:90%
comes through.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.665 align:middle line:84%
So that you're tap-- that's
sort of how you can feel it,

00:27:20.665 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that you're tapping something
that will just come the more

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.150 align:middle line:90%
you're tapping it.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the whole notion
of perpetual motion, you know,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:84%
the parts that make up
the devices will wear out.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the source of energy
which is infinite and abundant.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
distinction there.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So could this really
power our entire world

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:90%
as we know it?

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.670 align:middle line:90%
It really could?

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.003 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: It all depends on
the scale that you build it.

00:27:46.003 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:84%
You can have little one
inside your clock radio,

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.072 align:middle line:84%
you can have one that
runs your house--

00:27:50.072 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your car.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: --you can have
one that runs your car.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
You can have one where you
do some illustrations of how

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:84%
you could have one run entire
communities in the film.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is fascinating.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.150 align:middle line:90%
So it's the scale.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Yeah.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we did by bringing this out

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
in our movie and on the
website, thrivemovement.com,

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:84%
is that one way to protect
people-- One of the men

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that we had planned to talk
to for the movie, Maloff,

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:84%
he was actually murdered before
we were able to interview him.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
It's dangerous at this
time for the inventors.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But the more people who know
about it, and who call for this

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.144 align:middle line:84%
and put this conversation
on the table,

00:28:26.144 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:84%
the more it becomes something
that we have to reckon with,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:90%
because the inventors are there.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They're all over the world
in garage laboratories

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and hidden now for
their own safety.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.174 align:middle line:84%
But there have been people
funding the development

00:28:38.174 --> 00:28:40.590 align:middle line:84%
of this, not because it's been
a good investment for them,

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:44.540 align:middle line:84%
but because they know what
can happen on our planet

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:90%
as a result of it.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:90%
And so, it exists.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:90%
We've seen it.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we really encourage

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.720 align:middle line:84%
is spread the movie because
it brings this conversation

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
up, which then makes
it safer for people.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.808 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the same
thing on my radio show

00:28:59.808 --> 00:29:04.340 align:middle line:84%
in the cancer societies and the
cures, and so forth, out there.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing this
information out in a huge way,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:84%
in a viral way online
and in the movies.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.530 align:middle line:84%
How do you plan on
staying protected?

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, first of
all, we're not actually

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.100 align:middle line:90%
the inventors.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Stopping us, hassling
us, at this point,

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is only going to bring
more attention to the story

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.240 align:middle line:90%
that we're telling.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing is
tying the dots together.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.462 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we've
already done that.

00:29:31.462 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
As Kimberly likes to say, the
toothpaste is out of the tube

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And we've made it very clear,
if somebody hassles us,

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.966 align:middle line:84%
the whole world will--
Millions of people

00:29:38.966 --> 00:29:40.090 align:middle line:90%
have seen "THRIVE" already.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people will find
out about the dynamics that

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:90%
are going on with us instantly.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the great things
about the internet

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.630 align:middle line:84%
these days is that we're
being very transparent

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:84%
about everything, including
if anybody hassles us,

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.310 align:middle line:84%
which, fortunately,
they haven't so far.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.643 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: And the one
thing about the free energy

00:29:57.643 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:84%
is-- "THRIVE's" out
in 10 languages now.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:84%
It'll be out in 16
languages within a week.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.169 align:middle line:84%
People have been voluntarily
translating it into languages

00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:07.460 align:middle line:90%
to get into their own cultures.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And these inventors,
an awareness of this,

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.790 align:middle line:90%
is throughout the world.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So, that's another
thing that's possible

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.472 align:middle line:84%
by being so international,
and to have this outreach,

00:30:17.472 --> 00:30:19.430 align:middle line:84%
is that there's the
cross-pollination of people

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
who know different parts
of it and can share.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.231 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it'll bring
out other inventors

00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to come forth and say,
I understand this now,

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:90%
I want to combat the system.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So you had mentioned
something earlier

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
about why doesn't this exist,
why does this energy not exist,

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and that they
couldn't get patents.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So you started to
follow the money,

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.720 align:middle line:84%
follow where-- why the patent
industry wouldn't give them

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:84%
patents, why this
got suppressed.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is shown very
clearly, this next clip.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.484 align:middle line:90%
I want you to see that.

00:30:50.484 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:84%
-As difficult as
it was for me, I've

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:84%
come to an inescapable
and profoundly disturbing

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.550 align:middle line:90%
conclusion.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe that an elite group
of people and the corporations

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:84%
they run have gained control
over not just our energy, food

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:84%
supply, education,
and health care,

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:84%
but over virtually every
aspect of our lives.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And they do it by controlling
the world of finance,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:84%
not by creating more value,
but by actually controlling

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.850 align:middle line:90%
the source of money.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:84%
When I followed
the money, I found

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.945 align:middle line:84%
that it took me up the
levels of a pyramid.

00:31:25.945 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Here we are, at
the bottom level,

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:90%
going about our daily lives.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Above us is
government, people who

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:84%
are given a monopoly on force
and use it to tax and control

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:90%
us, whether or not we agree.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:90%
But who controls them?

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:84%
At the next level
are the corporations.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Many would say that it is now
corporations, and not nation

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:90%
states, that rule the world.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:90%
They call it a corporatocracy.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.930 align:middle line:84%
To acquire the world's resources
and control the markets,

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.210 align:middle line:84%
this corporatocracy must
have access to cheap money.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:84%
The big corporations get
their loans at special rates

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:84%
from the big banks,
which means that those

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.400 align:middle line:84%
who control the major
banks, the monied elite,

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:84%
ultimately control
the corporations.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
As I followed the
money, I've learned

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.570 align:middle line:84%
that almost everything I
once believed about money

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.460 align:middle line:90%
is simply not true.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:84%
-It's interesting how
few questions we actually

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:84%
ask about very everyday things,
like when we go into a bank

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and we ask for a loan, say
$50,000, 50,000 pounds,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.920 align:middle line:90%
what actually happens?

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.620 align:middle line:84%
You see, most people
live their lives

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.300 align:middle line:84%
based on a kind of vague
image of what happens.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.870 align:middle line:84%
What actually happens is
you ask for 50,000 pounds.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:84%
They type into your
account 50,000 pounds.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:90%
That's all they do.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't mint any coins,
they don't print any money,

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:84%
they don't move any
precious metal anywhere.

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:84%
They just put 50,000
pounds into your account

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:90%
on a computer screen.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:00.420 align:middle line:84%
From that moment, you
start paying interest

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:06.370 align:middle line:84%
on money that has never, does
not, and will never exist.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.020 align:middle line:84%
-It turns out that
banks actually

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.970 align:middle line:84%
have about nine times
as much money loaned out

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.787 align:middle line:84%
as they have on reserve
in their vaults.

00:33:12.787 --> 00:33:13.620 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Does this-- this
explains why the bad bank loans

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:84%
happen, why there's
so many foreclosures?

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It explains so much
that, basically,

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.070 align:middle line:84%
if everything that we
have, as far as we know it,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:30.090 align:middle line:84%
as money is just a number typed
into a computer screen, then

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:90%
does it really exist?

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, the
computer screen exists,

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:84%
the numbers exist,
and then there's

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.320 align:middle line:90%
the reality that we live in.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But the relationship
between them is not honest,

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and it hasn't been
for 400 years.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:50.620 align:middle line:84%
It's just that this banking
scam, this centralized fiat

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:84%
money, which means making
up money out of nothing,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and then fractional reserve,
where the bankers get

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.680 align:middle line:84%
to make up money and loan out
10 times as much as they have.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if everyone
got to do that.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It's basically as if you were
playing Monopoly with someone,

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and one person is getting to
make up money and the others

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:90%
aren't.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
So, a lot of people
like to think

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
that money is evil, or at
least the root of all evil,

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.120 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.659 align:middle line:84%
And money is just a
medium of exchange,

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.030 align:middle line:90%
or a storehouse of value.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.639 align:middle line:84%
It's when you have a
dishonest money system, that's

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:84%
when people's lives
start getting destroyed.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.159 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
elite, who've had

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
this scheme for so many
decades, so many centuries,

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:84%
don't want to have the
money backed by gold.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to have the
money back by real commodities,

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.114 align:middle line:90%
real goods and services--

00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because they can't be.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Because
they can't control it.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.360 align:middle line:84%
An economy isn't something
someone decides and controls,

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.290 align:middle line:84%
it's the individual
free choices of millions

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:47.190 align:middle line:84%
of people about what they're
buying and selling and making

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:90%
all that stuff.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.719 align:middle line:84%
And the people who want
to control everything

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:51.739 align:middle line:90%
have to control that.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.281 align:middle line:84%
And in order to control that,
they have to control the money.

00:34:54.281 --> 00:34:55.238 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Right.

00:34:55.238 --> 00:34:56.659 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things we did learn

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not as complicated
as it's made to seem.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, part of what we
tried to do in the movie

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is to really break it down
so that people can understand

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.525 align:middle line:84%
the basics that you
need to understand.

00:35:08.525 --> 00:35:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And the whole reason for
getting into the money,

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and into this
agenda, is so that we

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
can understand what's in
the way of our thriving.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the question
we started out with.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
whole point of this,

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.160 align:middle line:90%
are to have leverage solutions.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And in order to be
leveraged, we have

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:27.740 align:middle line:84%
to understand-- have an accurate
assessment of what's going on.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at what you can

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.900 align:middle line:84%
make people do when
they need to survive,

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.090 align:middle line:84%
then you can see
what's in the way.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.615 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the point of
getting into all of this.

00:35:37.615 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we've done
a good job of making it

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.190 align:middle line:84%
so that people can kind
of wrap around the basics

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and then come up with
what we can do about it.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Like I said about the banking,
when you understand what you're

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.472 align:middle line:84%
funding, then you
can stop funding it.

00:35:49.472 --> 00:35:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love how
you always bring

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:52.640 align:middle line:90%
this back to a practical place.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I really love your grounded
perspective, Kimberly,

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.110 align:middle line:84%
because I can get very
stuck in the details,

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and understanding it, and
down that rabbit hole.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But you always have a
way of just bringing us

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.810 align:middle line:84%
back to the whole
perspective of why we're

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.010 align:middle line:84%
having this conversation
in the first place.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.080 align:middle line:84%
It does help, however,
to understand,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.560 align:middle line:84%
as you have illustrated
in the film, the details

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.180 align:middle line:84%
on a high level picture, on
a very simple, layman's terms

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.360 align:middle line:84%
so that we can understand
this a little bit easier.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.607 align:middle line:84%
This next clip shows
about the Federal Reserve,

00:36:21.607 --> 00:36:22.940 align:middle line:90%
which I didn't quite understand.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.273 align:middle line:90%
And it explains it very clearly.

00:36:24.273 --> 00:36:25.954 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:36:25.954 --> 00:36:26.620 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:84%
-So we've got the Federal
Reserve, a privately owned

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.900 align:middle line:84%
corporation with a
monopoly on creating money,

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:84%
but with no accountability,
backed up by a government

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:90%
with a monopoly on force.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The country got sold on the
Fed as an institution that

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
would help stabilize the
economy and remain independent

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.230 align:middle line:90%
of politics.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:50.310 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, in close to
a century of existence,

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Reserve has
done just the opposite.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Since they took charge, we've
been robbed through inflation.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And the purchasing
power of the dollar

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.700 align:middle line:90%
has declined more than 96%.

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And the wealth gap makes
it clear most of the money

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.110 align:middle line:90%
is going to a very few.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Only 16 years after the
Federal Reserve was in power,

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.730 align:middle line:84%
America experienced
the Great Depression.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:84%
My research revealed that
before the big crash in 1929,

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:84%
the elite bankers pulled their
money out of the stock market.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:84%
After the crash,
they used that money

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:84%
to buy up cheap stocks
in smaller failing

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.750 align:middle line:90%
banks for pennies on the dollar.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Among the bankers who
consolidated their wealth

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:42.540 align:middle line:84%
this way were the Rothschilds,
Rockefellers, and Morgans.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.810 align:middle line:84%
A similar scenario played out
in the 2008 financial collapse,

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.200 align:middle line:84%
with the same
bankers benefiting.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.340 align:middle line:84%
In the years leading
up to the collapse,

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.230 align:middle line:84%
the biggest banks, including
Bank of America, Citigroup,

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.625 align:middle line:84%
and Chase, controlled by the
Rothschilds, Rockefellers,

00:37:58.625 --> 00:38:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and the Morgans, were
bundling and trading

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:84%
bad loans that they knew
would eventually fail.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.370 align:middle line:90%


00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting a
rotten oranges in a box

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:90%
and selling them as grade AAA.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:17.070 align:middle line:84%
The bundlers of the debt knew
it was only a matter of time

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.300 align:middle line:84%
before someone
would open that box

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.862 align:middle line:84%
and see that the
content was worthless,

00:38:21.862 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:84%
since they were
the ones who packed

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.150 align:middle line:90%
the boxes in the first place.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:30.310 align:middle line:84%
When the rotten oranges-- what
we hear about as unsound loans,

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:33.280 align:middle line:84%
derivatives, and
credit default swaps--

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.010 align:middle line:84%
were finally discovered,
everyone was impacted.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:41.540 align:middle line:84%
People lost their homes,
their jobs, their businesses,

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.830 align:middle line:90%
and their retirements.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the biggest
banks who created

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:84%
the problem in the first
place were the ones who got

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:90%
bailed out.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Why would the Federal Reserve
give trillions to the banks

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:84%
even though the
majority of Americans

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:90%
were against bailing them out?

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And why not help
those most in need

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.870 align:middle line:84%
rather than the perpetrators
of the financial collapse?

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.647 align:middle line:90%

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Not of time, but--
What do you think?

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.579 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: I think,
in every culture,

00:39:17.579 --> 00:39:21.479 align:middle line:84%
there are some people whose
psyches are distorted enough

00:39:21.479 --> 00:39:24.020 align:middle line:84%
by what they've gone through in
their childhood, or whatever,

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.394 align:middle line:84%
that they become obsessed with
controlling other people's

00:39:26.394 --> 00:39:29.670 align:middle line:84%
lives because they are very
afraid and caught in illusion.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not in just
this country, in many--

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:31.584 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.584 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: All over the world
and throughout history.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.416 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
important that a culture

00:39:35.416 --> 00:39:39.290 align:middle line:84%
be able to heal them but not
give them the nuclear weapons

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and control over the government,
or the money, or the military,

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:90%
or that type of thing.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I think when the original
banking scheme started,

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.686 align:middle line:84%
it was just like
a clever notion,

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:84%
like we illustrated
in the movie, where

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.810 align:middle line:84%
the goldsmiths realize
that they could make loans

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.570 align:middle line:84%
on money that they
didn't actually have.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.445 align:middle line:84%
And so they just did
it, and got away with it

00:39:58.445 --> 00:40:01.610 align:middle line:84%
for a long time because they
kind of kept it to themselves.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, I think, that
the money people basically

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:84%
got together with
the control people,

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.350 align:middle line:84%
with the politicians, who
wanted to control other people's

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.514 align:middle line:84%
lives, and basically--
and a good example of it

00:40:13.514 --> 00:40:14.930 align:middle line:84%
is with the Federal
Reserve, where

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.620 align:middle line:84%
they made a deal--
OK, we'll make up

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.570 align:middle line:84%
money for you-- The politicians
said, we'll let you,

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
the bankers, make up the money
as long as you give us whatever

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:84%
we need when we
want to go to war,

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:84%
or give our crony capitalists
some subsidies, or whatever.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on,
when a small group of people

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.240 align:middle line:84%
get the power over both
the force and the money,

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to rise
to tyranny every time.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It always has
throughout history.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
the solutions need

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.479 align:middle line:84%
to undermine that and grow
a more organic system.

00:40:44.479 --> 00:40:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: And I
want to say something here

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.470 align:middle line:84%
about understanding
this system and naming

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.710 align:middle line:90%
the perpetrators of it.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The purpose isn't to create an
us and them, and they're bad

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're not, or
anything like that.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:02.820 align:middle line:84%
The point is-- I feel like we
have a terminal illness going

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.800 align:middle line:90%
on on our planet right now.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And to understand
how is it operating

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:84%
allows-- If somebody just
says, you are really sick, what

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:90%
do you about that?

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, before
I had an understanding

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.057 align:middle line:84%
and before we did the work
that went into "THRIVE,"

00:41:19.057 --> 00:41:20.640 align:middle line:84%
that was sort of my
take on the world.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like, we are really sick.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Things are wrong
all over the place,

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.710 align:middle line:84%
even though people are
innovative and good,

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:30.590 align:middle line:84%
in my experience, and resilient,
and caring, and cooperative.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
The fact is
everything's in decline.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, having this
understanding, it's like, OK.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to
understand that this isn't-- we

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.040 align:middle line:84%
didn't do this to
name some people,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and this is where all
the bad comes from.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they have a
belief that the two options are

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.000 align:middle line:84%
either to control
or be controlled.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.170 align:middle line:90%
That's their worldview.

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And to choose to be the
controller in that situation

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.820 align:middle line:90%
is understandable.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.520 align:middle line:84%
But, like Foster says, you
don't put them in power;

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.970 align:middle line:90%
you heal them.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.460 align:middle line:90%
You obsolete them from power.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And our job, if
we're here to heal,

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and I believe we have
to be here to heal,

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.090 align:middle line:84%
is to understand
how they operate,

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:09.580 align:middle line:84%
look at it
realistically, and go,

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
this money system is
completely corrupt,

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and it is ruining our planet
and the billions of lives on it.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:90%
And we need to name that.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.010 align:middle line:84%
We need to come to
terms with it so that we

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:22.950 align:middle line:84%
can create the
solutions that are

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:90%
sufficient to the task at hand.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole point
of uncovering this.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not to make anybody wrong.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It's to understand
how is it operating,

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:84%
get them out of these
positions of power,

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and work with our money system
to create an honest money

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.280 align:middle line:84%
system so that, in fact,
more people can have a chance

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:39.780 align:middle line:90%
to thrive.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's very important
to get out of the denial

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.240 align:middle line:84%
that we might be in, or even
the glaze that we're under,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious glaze
that we are intentionally

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.810 align:middle line:84%
being put under, by being
aware of these types of things.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's important.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But for me, in the
back of my mind,

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I keep saying, what does
this help me with right now,

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:02.420 align:middle line:90%
right here, today?

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:84%
What do I do when I'm
done watching this film,

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and then I go to cook
dinner for my family?

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Knowing this information
weighs on me so heavily.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.810 align:middle line:84%
There is the new world
order being spoken about.

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.856 align:middle line:84%
There is the
conspiracy theories.

00:43:14.856 --> 00:43:16.480 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts
of things mentioned

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.300 align:middle line:84%
in this film that
can be so daunting.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very
important to understand

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
intentionality out there

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.337 align:middle line:84%
to suppress my
knowledge of this.

00:43:28.337 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's really great that you
bring this about in the film,

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.700 align:middle line:84%
but I need to know
what I can do.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.131 align:middle line:90%
What can I do today?

00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:36.380 align:middle line:84%
When you were going through
all this information, when

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.520 align:middle line:84%
you were uncovering
all of this, how

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.257 align:middle line:84%
did you go through
that experience?

00:43:40.257 --> 00:43:41.840 align:middle line:84%
What was that like
for you personally?

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, it was very
challenging, and especially

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.580 align:middle line:84%
because we were getting
pieces one at a time,

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.561 align:middle line:84%
and just one piece of
bad news after another.

00:43:49.561 --> 00:43:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh no,
they wouldn't do that.

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my gosh, they
are doing that.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So, one of my biggest concerns
in putting this film out

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:01.390 align:middle line:84%
was to condense what had taken
me so many years to process,

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.410 align:middle line:84%
intellectually and emotionally,
to put that out in two hours.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.004 align:middle line:84%
How are people going
to handle that?

00:44:06.004 --> 00:44:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the good news is people
are saying, even though it's

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.737 align:middle line:84%
challenging, that
they're really grateful

00:44:10.737 --> 00:44:12.070 align:middle line:90%
and that people are handling it.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm asking
them, how come you

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:84%
can handle it so much
faster than I could?

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And what the feedback
we're getting

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.280 align:middle line:84%
is one, because we're
telling a coherent story,

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.750 align:middle line:84%
whereas, we just have random
pieces that looked disastrous.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're tying them together
into a story that makes sense

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.220 align:middle line:84%
more than the corporate media,
what they're telling us.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, it's
completely wrapped

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.480 align:middle line:84%
in viable, grounded
solutions, things we

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:90%
can actually do about it.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, very
important, and we're

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:90%
going to get to those solutions.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And I did mention that there
is a mention in the film

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:84%
several times about
a new world order.

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:45.010 align:middle line:84%
What would that
give the elite few?

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.107 align:middle line:90%
What would a world order do?

00:44:47.107 --> 00:44:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, the key
distinction, for me,

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.231 align:middle line:84%
about a new world order--
because I mention in the film

00:44:51.231 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that, given our predicament,
it sounds like a good thing

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.560 align:middle line:84%
to have a new world-- you
know, some order in the world

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and have it new because
the current one's not

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.040 align:middle line:90%
serving many people.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing is
that the new world

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:05.600 align:middle line:84%
order that you hear George
Bush talk about, and Henry

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Kissinger, and the leaders of
the countries who are involved

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:12.610 align:middle line:84%
in this, over and
over again, that

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:13.990 align:middle line:90%
is a whole different order.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And that, basically, is
a global police state

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.700 align:middle line:90%
with the bankers in charge.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And then using the UN to
structure all of the states

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.745 align:middle line:84%
to be managed, and use
NATO as the police force,

00:45:26.745 --> 00:45:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and create a one world currency
where you can neutralize anyone

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:30.850 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:34.160 align:middle line:84%
That's their idea of
the new world order

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.560 align:middle line:84%
that they can,
supposedly, control.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have the quote
from David Rockefeller praising

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.560 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese system under which
70 million people, civilians,

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.270 align:middle line:90%
were killed during peace time.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you can look
at their economy,

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:84%
it's a combination
of what they're

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.750 align:middle line:84%
calling authoritarian democracy,
or authoritarian capitalism,

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:01.097 align:middle line:84%
where, basically,
they control people.

00:46:01.097 --> 00:46:02.805 align:middle line:84%
They get them to work
for them, then take

00:46:02.805 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:84%
the advantage of
capitalism, but then

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.050 align:middle line:84%
have this umbrella of domination
over everybody's lives.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
trying to wake people up to

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:13.770 align:middle line:84%
is that there is another
option, which actually

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.560 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
freedom for everyone.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And that throughout history--
the more of that we have,

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.055 align:middle line:84%
the more prosperity and
security that everybody has.

00:46:22.055 --> 00:46:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, when we come back,
we're going to talk about some

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.880 align:middle line:84%
of the solutions
around this, and some

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.470 align:middle line:84%
of the ideas that we can--
Awareness, I always say,

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.100 align:middle line:90%
is 80% of the solution.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And you have brought
awareness about.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we're very lucky
to be able to digest it

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:37.804 align:middle line:84%
in the first hour of your
film, which is great,

00:46:37.804 --> 00:46:38.970 align:middle line:90%
you give us an hour on this.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:40.725 align:middle line:90%
You spent eight years on it.

00:46:40.725 --> 00:46:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So when we come
back, we're going

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.510 align:middle line:84%
to get into some
of the solutions

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:46.810 align:middle line:84%
that the movie "THRIVE" presents
with Kimberly and Foster

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Gamble.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.101 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right bck.

00:46:48.101 --> 00:46:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, and my guests
are Kimberley and Foster Gamble.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
the movie "THRIVE."

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned earlier
that these films-- the clips

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're showing
you will definitely

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:06.300 align:middle line:84%
change the way that
you look at your life.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And it has definitely
done that for me.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But more so than just a
movie, this is a movement.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can also see
the movie, for free,

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:16.906 align:middle line:84%
at the website, which
is thrivemovement.com,

00:47:16.906 --> 00:47:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much
more than a website.

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:84%
You have definitely
put a lot into this.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.300 align:middle line:84%
There was a piece in the film
that impacted me greatly.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was about the cashless
society that we live in.

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a very
important clip to show.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:35.564 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:47:35.564 --> 00:47:36.230 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:38.560 align:middle line:84%
-You want to change
society in a way

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.200 align:middle line:84%
that you know that
if you do it openly

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.280 align:middle line:84%
you know you're going to
get an adverse reaction.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.430 align:middle line:90%
So you don't do it openly.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.810 align:middle line:84%
You play problem, reaction,
solution, stage one.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:90%
You create a problem.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.260 align:middle line:84%
It could be a terrorist
bomb, it could be a 9/11,

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.730 align:middle line:84%
it could be a run
on a currency, it

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.950 align:middle line:84%
could be a stock market
collapse, a government

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:57.430 align:middle line:90%
collapse.

00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:07.540 align:middle line:84%
You tell the people your version
of A, who did it, and B, why.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
problem, reaction,

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.470 align:middle line:84%
solution would
fall down if we had

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:15.513 align:middle line:84%
a media that was in any
way related to journalism.

00:48:15.513 --> 00:48:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the mainstream media
is a public relations office

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:25.480 align:middle line:84%
for the official
version of events.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.140 align:middle line:84%
-It turns out
President George W Bush

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.320 align:middle line:84%

weapons of mass destruction.

-The virtually only way
or source of information

00:48:35.729 --> 00:48:37.270 align:middle line:84%
that the public have
about this event

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:39.040 align:middle line:90%
is from the mainstream media.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And what they're looking at
stage two of problem, reaction,

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:47.890 align:middle line:84%
solution is the reaction of
outrage of key, key, key fear.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And they want the public
to say to the government,

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.080 align:middle line:84%
something must be
done, this can't go on.

What are you going
to do about it?

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And this allows
stage three, which

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.510 align:middle line:84%
is those who've created
the problem glean

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that public reaction
with a false story

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.867 align:middle line:84%
to then openly offer the
solutions to the problems

00:49:04.867 --> 00:49:06.075 align:middle line:90%
they have themselves created.

>>LISA: It is true in
many ways, the media

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.270 align:middle line:90%
is owned by the government.

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:13.225 align:middle line:90%
And it is such a powerful media.

00:49:13.225 --> 00:49:14.620 align:middle line:90%
It is very powerful.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It shapes the way that
people think about things.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.330 align:middle line:90%
It gives us slants.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love free
speech media, which

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.050 align:middle line:84%
is I what I'm part of and
what you're a part of.

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.766 align:middle line:84%
So, explain that a
little bit of what

00:49:27.766 --> 00:49:29.140 align:middle line:84%
you were talking
about in terms--

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and what David Icke
was talking about.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, the whole notion
of this sort of imminent police

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.590 align:middle line:84%
state can sound like a bad B
movie, or something like that.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something we
much want to think about.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Or, you can think, well,
that's one of those conspiracy

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:43.760 align:middle line:90%
theories.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But if you look,
daily, in the headlines

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:51.550 align:middle line:84%
you see that President
Obama signed the NDAA, which

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:55.450 align:middle line:84%
allows for the indefinite
detention, rendition,

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.600 align:middle line:84%
even assassination, of
American citizens for no even

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:04.670 align:middle line:84%
probable cause other than
that they are a suspect,

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.150 align:middle line:84%
or that they dissent with
the government opinion.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Then on March 16, he quietly
signed a dictatorial executive

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:middle line:84%
order, which gives him
the power to take over--

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.740 align:middle line:84%
in case of national
defense needs--

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:24.210 align:middle line:84%
to take over, basically, the
resources of the country.

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It's called the National
Defense Resources Preparedness.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And that allows him to take
over labor, take over food,

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:36.570 align:middle line:84%
to take over the resources, and
even-- I was reading carefully

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:84%
through the document--
it brings back

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.804 align:middle line:84%
in the possibility of
initiating a draft like that.

00:50:41.804 --> 00:50:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A draft?

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GAMBLE: A draft.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.850 align:middle line:84%
A part of this is he can take
over the Selective Service,

00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and, basically, do what he
wa-- So this just happened.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.940 align:middle line:84%
One person was able
to sign this thing.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Then the NSA is just
completing a $2 billion

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:84%
project, a one-million
square foot facility in Utah,

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.160 align:middle line:84%
which, they admit, is
going to be collecting

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.330 align:middle line:84%
all of our emails, all
of our phone calls,

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:11.250 align:middle line:84%
all of our Google
searches, in one place.

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Then the Homeland Security just
purchased 450 million rounds

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of these very expensive,
very dangerous hollow point

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.900 align:middle line:90%
.40 caliber bullets.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And when pressed on why would
Homeland Security be doing

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.780 align:middle line:84%
anything-- They said,
for target practice.

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, even the
military doesn't really

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.280 align:middle line:84%
use those kind of bullets
for target practice.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So what is the story that makes
any sense of this preparation?

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.150 align:middle line:84%
When the IMF and the
World Bank has collapsed

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:44.740 align:middle line:84%
over 70 countries around the
world, there's always blowback,

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.620 align:middle line:84%
always people take
to the streets.

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's usually
crushed, and they get on

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.867 align:middle line:84%
with taking over the
resources of the planet.

00:51:50.867 --> 00:51:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And people think, well,
that couldn't happen here.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:54.533 align:middle line:84%
Well, look what's
happening in Greece,

00:51:54.533 --> 00:51:57.440 align:middle line:84%
look what's happening in
Europe, and it absolutely

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.410 align:middle line:90%
can happen here.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And these are what
the headlines look

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.760 align:middle line:84%
like leading up to
something like that.

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.789 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, I mean, this is
all questions, questions.

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Why would something
like this happen?

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:08.510 align:middle line:84%
How could something
like this happen

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:09.630 align:middle line:90%
without us knowing about it?

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't this more in the news.

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe because the
media is bought and paid for.

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.231 align:middle line:84%
But let's-- I mentioned that
we have to get to the solutions

00:52:16.231 --> 00:52:16.730 align:middle line:90%
around this.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We could spend hours,
and it gets daunting.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.350 align:middle line:84%
But I need to know, again,
I'm back to that question

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:22.920 align:middle line:90%
of what can we do?

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Where is the hope?

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.109 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be
practical, plausible hope.

00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: I just want to
say one last comment on where

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:31.430 align:middle line:84%
we were, which is
that one thing we

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:33.230 align:middle line:84%
did with "THRIVE,"
the movie-- and it's

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:34.604 align:middle line:84%
available at
thrivemovement.com--

00:52:34.604 --> 00:52:37.410 align:middle line:84%
is that we had all of
the facts corroborated.

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Because just having
like-- these are facts.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:42.500 align:middle line:84%
March 16, Obama signed
that executive order.

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.970 align:middle line:84%
You can look in Bluffdale,
Utah, and it's happening there.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.515 align:middle line:84%
Homeland Security admits
buying these bullets.

00:52:48.515 --> 00:52:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So these aren't like things
that are being made up.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.615 align:middle line:84%
These are facts, and you can
see them under Foster's blog

00:52:53.615 --> 00:52:56.510 align:middle line:84%
or under the fact check
part of our website.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And the point for
doing that is to say,

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:84%
look, if these are
the facts, then how

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:03.715 align:middle line:84%
can we develop the
solution strategies that

00:53:03.715 --> 00:53:06.450 align:middle line:84%
are commensurate
with these facts.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we focus on
economic responses and things

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:09.780 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to say that
this isn't just like something

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:13.850 align:middle line:90%
that we heard about.

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:17.110 align:middle line:84%
We track this stuff,
and then we have

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.030 align:middle line:90%
it corroborated third hand.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what went
into making the movie.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And the point of it
isn't to scare us;

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:25.859 align:middle line:84%
it's to say, OK, if this is
happening, now what we do?

00:53:25.859 --> 00:53:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm happy that we can
get into this part of it

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.423 align:middle line:90%

>>CARTER GAMBLE: Yeah.

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.506 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I found, as
we've travelled around,

00:54:04.506 --> 00:54:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and as the movie's been
seen by millions of people,

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:10.570 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of people know a
little bit about it, you know.

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And so our job, really, was to
kind of cohere it and say, OK,

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:15.620 align:middle line:90%
so now what, you know?

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And really, we made a
choice in making this movie

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to address people as the
intelligent, capable people

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.490 align:middle line:90%

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:24.790 align:middle line:84%

that that's, in fact,

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.000 align:middle line:90%
how people are responding.

OK.

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.740 align:middle line:90%
I got it, and now let's move on.

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and that their own safety
depends on maintaining

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.880 align:middle line:84%
absolute control
over the rest of us.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.170 align:middle line:84%
In short, their worldview is
based on scarcity and fear.

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But as powerful as they are,
the architects of the new world

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.610 align:middle line:84%
order cannot create their
dreadful vision without

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:24.010 align:middle line:90%
our collusion.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:27.900 align:middle line:84%
To stop them, to render
their agenda obsolete,

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:90%
we have to wake up.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.710 align:middle line:90%
We have to take action.

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:36.770 align:middle line:84%
-This is like the last
effort of a particular phase

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:37.580 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.560 align:middle line:90%
It's its last gasp, really.

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And I often use the metaphor
of the caterpillar becoming

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:46.370 align:middle line:84%
the butterfly because
a caterpillar crunches

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:49.072 align:middle line:84%
its way through the ecosystem,
it's very destructive,

00:55:49.072 --> 00:55:51.920 align:middle line:84%
it eats 300 times
its weight in a day

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.630 align:middle line:84%
until it's so bloated that
it hangs itself up and goes

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:55.610 align:middle line:90%
to sleep.

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And its skin turns into
a hardened chrysalis,

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and then in its body you
get these imaginal cells--

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.620 align:middle line:84%
biologists actually
call them that-- forming

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.380 align:middle line:90%
within the caterpillar's body.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.150 align:middle line:84%
The caterpillar's
body then, actually,

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:11.900 align:middle line:84%
becomes a nutritive
soup for those cells.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But what's important about
that metaphor is that the old

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:18.630 align:middle line:90%
and the new coexist for awhile.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's the job
of the caterpillar

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.580 align:middle line:90%
to preserve its life.

00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a desperate
government that we have now

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.210 align:middle line:84%
trying to control oil
in the Middle East,

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and wanting now to
promote nuclear energy,

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.210 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.680 align:middle line:84%
They know better, but
they have to play out

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.480 align:middle line:84%
the role of
protecting themselves.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.740 align:middle line:90%
It's their job.

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you love
butterflies, you don't

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.550 align:middle line:84%
go around stepping
on caterpillars.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So we can't hate them,
it doesn't do any good.

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you want
alternative energy,

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:49.740 align:middle line:84%
you don't ask an oil
economy administration

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.070 align:middle line:90%
to produce it for you.

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:52.280 align:middle line:90%
We have to produce it.

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.540 align:middle line:84%
We imaginal cells
have to show that it's

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:57.800 align:middle line:84%
cheaper, more efficient,
and more effective.

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.780 align:middle line:84%

00:57:08.196 --> 00:57:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with me
some of the initiatives

that are happening?

00:57:10.861 --> 00:57:13.960 align:middle line:84%

>>GAMBLE: Well, first,
I would frame it

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.990 align:middle line:84%
as saying that there are
overarching strategies, which

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:31.590 align:middle line:84%
we need to understand, like
getting an honest money system,

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:35.680 align:middle line:84%
restoring polyculture, organic
farming, things like that.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But people go, oh
geez, how's little old

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.590 align:middle line:84%
me going to do
something like that.

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:42.280 align:middle line:84%
It's important that we have
those large strategies,

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.710 align:middle line:84%
but then that it get reduced
down to individual tactics

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that each of us can
do in our daily lives,

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that for most people don't
take a lot of time or money.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So we've highlighted
on the website kind

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of our favorite

And that's step number one.

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And even that takes some
time and some courage

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:09.526 align:middle line:84%

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:30.340 align:middle line:90%
So we will not accept patenting.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.020 align:middle line:84%

cooperate with salt laws.

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:39.100 align:middle line:84%
We will not allow chemicals and
genetically engineered crops

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:41.020 align:middle line:84%

to say, this is
continuing to grow.

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Marin County, California,
is now GMO-free.

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we're doing

00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:24.880 align:middle line:84%
is we're coming out with
an app early this summer

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that will actually allow the
cities around who are engaged

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:31.220 align:middle line:84%
in different solution

what each other's doing.

So that anybody who wants
to set up a GMO-free zone

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.376 align:middle line:84%
can then get some of the back
end, whether it's the flyers,

00:59:41.376 --> 00:59:42.750 align:middle line:84%
or how they dealt
with the media,

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:45.480 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they did in order
to-- the legislation that

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.630 align:middle line:84%
had to happen in
their local community.

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So that that's one
of the ways that we

00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:52.350 align:middle line:84%
can allow this to
spread faster is

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:55.216 align:middle line:84%
by having everybody who's
working on it actually

00:59:55.216 --> 00:59:56.840 align:middle line:84%

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:05.129 align:middle line:84%
tied back to the government
control, haven't you?

the money in the food,

initiative with the Green
Revolution, and so forth.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that they
shifted all of agriculture

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to be based on oil because
they were controlling oil.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%

this cycle of pesticides,

and herbicides, and fertilizers.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Not just because they
can make more money

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:29.320 align:middle line:84%
on it, which they do,
but also because food

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.910 align:middle line:90%

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:33.802 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it's become

in the school systems.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:56.140 align:middle line:84%

with packaged, processed foods
laden with chemicals and fat.

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is dumbing down
children, who are already

in a dominated system
of education right now.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.609 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that has to be-- Again,

01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:11.900 align:middle line:90%
it has to happen with the moms.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.852 align:middle line:84%
It has to happen
with the networks

01:01:13.852 --> 01:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
of the people in the
communities to make this happen.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:19.454 align:middle line:84%

great solution, awareness.

01:01:19.454 --> 01:01:20.370 align:middle line:90%

system in the
elementary schools.

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we
did was we got on the radio

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.260 align:middle line:84%
every morning during
commuter traffic

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and named the menu for the day
for the kids in the school.

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And we said, if you don't
feel good about this,

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:38.690 align:middle line:90%
call this number.

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
everybody got organized,

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and they had all kinds of
local farms, and restaurants,

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and people kick in and
start to change the system.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.340 align:middle line:90%
So people are ready to act.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.820 align:middle line:84%
They just need to
know what to do.

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:53.394 align:middle line:84%
And we do have these top 10
actions, like Foster mentioned,

at thrivemovement.com.

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And also now, this way for
people to share best practices.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I am more encouraged
than I've ever been.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm more optimistic.

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
People really are ready,
and they're already

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.561 align:middle line:90%
doing all kinds of things.

01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things is,
with the media the way

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
it is, we don't get
to know about it.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But there is so
much good that is

01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:14.770 align:middle line:90%
happening all over the place.

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:16.670 align:middle line:90%
And we're not alone.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
None of us working
on it is alone.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And the thing,
when you know what

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
it is that you're here
to do, and you realize

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
have to do it all.

01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can do it
all, but you can

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.204 align:middle line:84%
tap into what's your
offering, do that,

01:02:28.204 --> 01:02:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and then it joins with everyone
else doing their offering.

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you offer so many
solutions on the website,

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
-We've spent years
creating a vast website,

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
thrivemovement.com, that
brings it all together

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and makes the information
and what we can do about it

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:51.680 align:middle line:90%
accessible to everyone.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Here you have your very
own navigator module

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to go deeper into the main
subjects covered in the film.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Code, problem, and solutions.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
You can study
strategies and tactics,

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and connect with others to
take high leverage actions.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
-Every fact stated in this
film has been independently

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
verified, and the reference
is on our website.

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
This sector navigator
facilitates whole systems

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
thinking that recognizes
that actions in one area

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:23.740 align:middle line:90%
impact all the others.

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
The center of the
sector navigator

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
is worldview because
it determines

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
how we experience
everything that

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:33.160 align:middle line:90%
happens within and around us.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
In every sector you'll find
critical issues, resources,

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
group strategies, and
individual actions

01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:44.270 align:middle line:84%
to peacefully and productively
effect real change.

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Our resource tree will link you
to the people, organizations,

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and media that we
most recommend to help

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
you get more fully
educated and engaged.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I was encouraged
to find that there

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.510 align:middle line:84%
are a minimum number of actions
which, working together,

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:02.860 align:middle line:90%
can tip the scales.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not endless.

01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Once we see the big picture,
we'll look at what each of us

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:10.320 align:middle line:90%
can do to help accomplish it.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
the strategic anecdotes

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:15.000 align:middle line:90%
to their economic domination.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop any
more bailouts of banks

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
or corporations, dismantle
the Federal Reserve,

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
withdraw taxpayer support
from central banking

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
agencies such as the
IMF and World Bank,

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
allow development of
alternative currencies

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:35.665 align:middle line:84%
and independent banks, and
refuse international taxes.

01:04:35.665 --> 01:04:37.310 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

>>LISA: Now, on that website
are people contributing

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
as to what's going on in
their local communities

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.029 align:middle line:90%
on a local level?

01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.986 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Right.

01:04:43.986 --> 01:04:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
The point about having
these big strategies

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
is so that-- For me, anything
electoral or legislative

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
has to have campaign
finance reform.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
That's a prerequisite, so that
we can then elect officials

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:02.040 align:middle line:84%
who actually would represent,
and so that we can say to them,

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
will you stop all bailouts, will
you participate in these larger

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
strategies that
we've identified?

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's kind of
through your politicians

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
that those sorts
of things happen.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, just personally,
what can I do-- You know,

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
the thing about this
pyramid of control

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.570 align:middle line:84%
is that it relies on-- the
real power's in the base.

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's where the people are.

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.090 align:middle line:90%
It requires our participation.

01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
This entire plan is based
on our participation.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we understand it
and withdraw from it--

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And my strong belief is that
the most leveraged power we have

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
is where we keep and
how we spend our money.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in keeping our
money in the banks--

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.740 align:middle line:84%
that because of fractional
reserve, which we do

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.950 align:middle line:84%
describe well on the
website and in the movie,

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:49.020 align:middle line:90%
our money's leveraged 10 times.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you put in $100 it's
$1,000, really, effectively,

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
of lending power that
you're giving the bank.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you bank with
a centralized bank.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Bank of America, Wells Fargo,
Union Bank of California,

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:03.990 align:middle line:84%
all numbers of them-- and
those are listed on our website

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
also-- basically, you are
funding these mega corporations

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
that are causing
all of the damage.

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:11.156 align:middle line:90%
And so--

01:06:11.156 --> 01:06:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what you do you?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.466 align:middle line:84%
You keep the cash
under your mattress?

01:06:14.466 --> 01:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE:
Local banks have

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.594 align:middle line:84%
the same fractional
reserve-- they're

01:06:17.594 --> 01:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
part of the same
Federal Reserve system,

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
but what happens is that they
make their loans locally,

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
so that in your own
community, providing loans

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:28.500 align:middle line:84%
to local businesses, and
homeowners, and car loans,

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.322 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the people,
the infrastructure

01:06:30.322 --> 01:06:31.530 align:middle line:90%
of your own community, needs.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So that when you
take your money out

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.220 align:middle line:84%
of a bank, a centralized
bank, and into a local bank

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
or community credit
union, you can,

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
literally, unfund
the problem and fund

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:56.972 align:middle line:84%
that it is, in fact, investing
in its own community.

01:06:56.972 --> 01:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: More personalized
attention that way, anyway,

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
when you know your
local bankers.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Absolutely.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
one of the things.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.056 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is where
you spend your money.

01:07:05.056 --> 01:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It really matters because it
sends a message, you know,

01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's
one of the things

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
come to terms with.

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Right now, as taxpayers we have
a lot of blood on our hands.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the fact of what's
happening in our name

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.660 align:middle line:90%
here all over the planet.

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the dollars we spend
that are in our control

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.650 align:middle line:90%
really do send a message.

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it OK with you
what this corporation

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
is doing around the
world or is it not?

01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you participate
locally and take responsibility

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.630 align:middle line:84%
for that, it makes
a big difference.

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And this thing about getting
informed and speaking up,

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I want to speak
to because, you know,

01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:41.360 align:middle line:90%
it takes a lot.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It's an uncomfortable
process to be

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
at in this pivotal time in
human history because some of us

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.230 align:middle line:90%
have to speak up.

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
are engaged in it,

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and there's a lot to talk about.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get
these conversations out

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.330 align:middle line:90%
into the open.

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And there will always
be those who resist it

01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and make it difficult
to talk about.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think finding,
you know, watching "THRIVE"

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:06.100 align:middle line:84%
in a group, make a
community event out of it.

>>CARTER GAMBLE: Right,
and I think also--

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.819 align:middle line:84%
the other thing
I want to mention

01:08:22.819 --> 01:08:24.920 align:middle line:84%
is that there are tools
for finding-- really

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.409 align:middle line:90%
exploring your own purpose.

01:08:26.409 --> 01:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Because like you said in
the very beginning, when

01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
you know your own purpose and
what your part is in this,

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.390 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes effortless
on a certain level

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:36.910 align:middle line:90%
just because it's so clear.

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:37.640 align:middle line:90%

a lot of the visuals

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:45.399 align:middle line:84%
a visual representation of what
the future would look like.

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:52.370 align:middle line:90%
what it can look like.

-I believe that having a
clear picture of our potential

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
is as important as uncovering
what stands in its way.

01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:06.319 align:middle line:84%
So I want to take you to a
possible world of the future.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a world the
elite would have

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
you believe is an
impossible pipe dream,

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
but I'm convinced
it's a world that

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:14.208 align:middle line:90%
is utterly within our grasp.

01:09:14.208 --> 01:09:17.016 align:middle line:90%


01:09:17.016 --> 01:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
We can create a world
where people can thrive,

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
where we can feel
safe and secure.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.220 align:middle line:84%
The air, water,
and food are clean.

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
A world where communities
are capable of producing

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
their own energy and food,
and trade is open and fair.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.899 align:middle line:84%
Rather than focusing
on punishment,

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
instead, justice restores
lives and losses.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Insurance pays doctors
to keep people healthy.

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Education is voluntary,
serving the needs

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:52.109 align:middle line:84%
of individuals instead
of corporations.

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
We get honest feedback
from independent media.

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
There are no subsidies
and no bail outs.

01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that with an
honest money system, little

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
or no taxes, and low
electric and fuel bills

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
you would have the money to
pay off your home and car,

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:12.830 align:middle line:90%
and be free to save and invest.

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:17.880 align:middle line:84%
You would enjoy more wealth,
freedom, and security.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.350 align:middle line:84%

Could we really do that?

01:10:24.052 --> 01:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: I've been working
with some of the economists who

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
appear in the movie
and on the website,

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and I would say, on
average, their estimates are

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that with an honest money system
and the free energy devices

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.270 align:middle line:84%
set free, that we would
have between six and 10

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%

assets and income

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have right now not
working any harder, probably

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:45.810 align:middle line:90%
less.

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:47.780 align:middle line:84%

what that would be
like for your life.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%

and what you invest in.

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:02.460 align:middle line:84%
You can start up
your creative idea--

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to even imagine
because we've gotten so used

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.714 align:middle line:84%

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.665 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, there's a
group called the Economic

01:11:19.665 --> 01:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Freedom of the World Forum, and
they put out an annual report--

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:middle line:84%
they have for
decades-- that tracks

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
the correlation
between prosperity

01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:31.240 align:middle line:90%
and economic and social freedom.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's an absolute
correlation.

01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:35.265 align:middle line:84%
The more economic
freedom that you--

01:11:35.265 --> 01:11:37.659 align:middle line:84%
the more economic and social
freedom that you have,

01:11:37.659 --> 01:11:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the safer you're going to be,
the happier you're going to be,

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.010 align:middle line:84%
the more prosperous
you're going to be.

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
A good example of how
freedom works is just

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship,
like in a family,

01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:52.660 align:middle line:84%
or at a shopping center
where you're looking

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
at, usually, a very
together situation,

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
which was created
by a free entity.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And the rows are
well taken care of,

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and the gardens are well
taken care of, and so forth.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.660 align:middle line:90%
So these are glimpses.

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
into your own life

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and see what decisions don't
you want to be able to make,

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.220 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to come up with any.

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where that basic
sense of an economy comes.

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're actually free
to make those decisions,

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
then the naturally honest
and effective businesses

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:24.720 align:middle line:90%
rise to the top.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
These big, crooked
banks would have

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
been out of business
a long time ago.

01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%

subsidies to Chevron

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:35.300 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the planet.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.082 align:middle line:84%
We just got it

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:39.320 align:middle line:90%

-We can't do everything at once.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I envision three
overlapping stages

01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:55.255 align:middle line:90%
of the solutions process.

01:12:55.255 --> 01:12:58.230 align:middle line:90%


01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
In stage one, we bring as
much integrity as possible

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.550 align:middle line:90%
to our current systems.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
If we cut the US
military budget in half,

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.860 align:middle line:84%
it would still roughly
equal the defense spending

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.440 align:middle line:90%
of the entire rest of the world.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Between that and getting
rid of the Federal Reserve,

01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:17.950 align:middle line:84%
over a trillion dollars
a year would be freed,

01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
enough to feed
everyone on our planet,

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
deal with social issues,
and heal our environment.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Many people believe that
widespread starvation

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.030 align:middle line:90%
and poverty are inevitable.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But compared to war,
eliminating poverty

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and restoring the
environment are cheap.

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
According to Lester Brown's
Earth Policy Institute,

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
it would take under
$200 billion a year

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.220 align:middle line:84%
to restore the
Earth's environment

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.815 align:middle line:90%
and meet global social goals.

01:13:43.815 --> 01:13:46.360 align:middle line:90%


01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
But this stage
isn't the end goal

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:50.250 align:middle line:90%
of the liberty perspective.

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
While stage one has a
lot of the compassion

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:56.170 align:middle line:84%
typically associated with
a liberal democrat agenda,

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:58.840 align:middle line:84%
stage two reflects
much of the wisdom

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
of the traditional
conservative worldview.

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
In stage two, we shrink
government's role

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:07.440 align:middle line:84%
to protect individual
liberty and stewarding

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.450 align:middle line:84%
things we share in
common, like ecosystems,

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.075 align:middle line:84%
and the airwaves we
use to communicate.

01:14:12.075 --> 01:14:15.370 align:middle line:90%


01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
As the system gains integrity
and we move to sound currency,

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
people will have
enough money to have

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
more control over everything
that affects them.

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Stage three grows out of
the increasing freedom

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that people gain in
stages one and two

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
as they have more
money and more time.

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:37.200 align:middle line:84%
There is no involuntary
tax, and therefore,

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.580 align:middle line:90%
no involuntary governance.

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.960 align:middle line:90%
There's no monopoly on force.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.660 align:middle line:90%
There are rules but no rulers.

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Rigorously protecting
individual rights

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:51.900 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be key for
honoring our interdependence.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:57.000 align:middle line:84%
We can be distinct and
unified at the same time.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.890 align:middle line:84%
As Utopian as this
can sound at first,

01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I've been thrilled to see how
much practical thinking has

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
been done to deal
with tough issues

01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
like health care,
crime, and education.

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
These three stages
validate the best

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
of both the liberal and
conservative perspectives

01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that have divided
us for so long,

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and then reconcile them at a
new level around non-violation,

01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:26.290 align:middle line:90%
a core ethic we all share.

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Stage three honors
human incentive

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and finally includes the rights
of not just many, not just

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.883 align:middle line:90%
most, but everyone.

information into the reticular

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.310 align:middle line:84%
activating system and
put it back out there.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.570 align:middle line:90%
It really is powerful.

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:51.607 align:middle line:84%
It's a feel good
part of the movie--

01:15:51.607 --> 01:15:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and I appreciate that
you put that-- how did

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.360 align:middle line:90%
you come up with those visuals?

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Just curious.

01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
How did you come up with that,
that hasn't been created yet?

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, we had
a wonderful 2D animator

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
named Michelle Enimark, a
young lady on the east coast.

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And we shared with her
our vision of this world.

01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And then she, actually,
collaborated with our 3D people

01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
who created this whole
kind of revolving world.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There actually--
There are some societies

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.770 align:middle line:84%
out there like that, and they
are fully self sustainable,

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:23.810 align:middle line:84%
non-reliant on outside
resources whatsoever.

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
But how could we get that
on a global level, really?

01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Well,
I think, starting

01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
in our own communities, I
think, as well as developing

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.120 align:middle line:90%
these other larger strategies.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But for me, what's so exciting
is this notion of the stages.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that we've been-- I was
for a long time sort of trapped

01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
in thinking I better
just try to focus

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
on what can be fixed right here,
right now, without actually

01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:53.140 align:middle line:84%
having a bigger vision of
what's actually possible.

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized is that with
this notion of true liberty,

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:59.220 align:middle line:84%
like really, not
just majority rule.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, we had an
experience where we live,

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
in northern California, where
there was a moth spray program

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:10.580 align:middle line:84%
coming down through--
Actually, George Bush, Sr.

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.520 align:middle line:90%
had earmarked--

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.228 align:middle line:90%
>>GAMBLE: Junior.

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:15.915 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE: Junior, yeah,
had earmarked $300 million

01:17:15.915 --> 01:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
for a spray, an
aerial spray assault,

01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
supposedly, for this
fruit-infesting light brown

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:24.150 align:middle line:90%
apple moth.

01:17:24.150 --> 01:17:26.284 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it was
filled with toxins.

01:17:26.284 --> 01:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And it started in
Monterey, and it

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.650 align:middle line:84%
was going to spray
millions of people

01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:31.320 align:middle line:90%
throughout northern California.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And we used a solution
model, that we'll

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:38.230 align:middle line:84%
be talking more about,
that's available

01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
at thrivemovement.com, to
help the communities organize.

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we-- and we

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.980 align:middle line:84%
were able to effectively stop
this program in six months.

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when we subpoenaed
some of the information

01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes,
one of the things

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.150 align:middle line:84%
that we saw was a
correspondence that said,

01:17:58.150 --> 01:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
we had anticipated some
resistance from Santa Cruz

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't know it
would be so well organized.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the point
is that communities

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
can organize both
to stop the problems

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and to create the solutions.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
about the stages

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
is that it gives a chance to
have-- It's like a compass.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
If you want to sail to
Hawaii, you don't just

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.690 align:middle line:84%
get there in a day, but
it's really important

01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
to remember that where
you're going is Hawaii.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:27.626 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the-- For
me, the thing about liberty--

01:18:27.626 --> 01:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
during the moth spray

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is that there was one
point where somebody said,

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.989 align:middle line:84%
we should just get
it on the ballot

01:18:33.989 --> 01:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and have it be that people
could vote on whether or not

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.950 align:middle line:90%
we want to have this spray.

01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And we said, that's like
voting on whether or not

01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:42.390 align:middle line:90%
it's OK to be raped.

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It is not all right.

01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
When we did the
work, we found out

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that there were
endocrine-disrupting toxins,

01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
the carcinogens-- I mean,
this was lethal spray

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.810 align:middle line:90%
that was coming down.

01:18:52.810 --> 01:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And the notion of a
majority rule vote, suddenly

01:18:56.270 --> 01:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
had me have the experience of
the limits of majority rule.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's the
best system that we've

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.744 align:middle line:84%
had so far-- democracy--
I came to-- I

01:19:06.744 --> 01:19:08.160 align:middle line:84%
had to come to
grips with the fact

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that that's different than
freedom and the opportunity

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:12.990 align:middle line:90%
to thrive for everyone.

01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And what about the people who've
been on that end of the stick

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:17.620 align:middle line:90%
all this time?

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we started to do
much more exploration

01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:23.220 align:middle line:84%
about a different
level of liberty.

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Sort of like Hawaii.

01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
What if you actually
wanted a system

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
where everybody had
a chance to thrive,

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and where you didn't
think about the majority

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
would rule even if
it meant what they

01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:36.770 align:middle line:84%
ruled was to impose
these systems

01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and toxins on each
other that were lethal?

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we've sort of backed--
so our stages come backwards

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.110 align:middle line:84%
from that view, that
ultimate vision,

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and we start with
where are we now.

01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And where we are now is we have
a completely corrupt system

01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and so many people who have
been disenfranchised from it

01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that we need to help
those right now who

01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
are in that position, while we
cut the Pentagon budget, get

01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:06.920 align:middle line:84%
this money system out-- the
whole Federal Reserve out

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
of the way so that
there can actually

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
be more money for people, so
that the role of government

01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
can then be limited
to protecting

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:16.310 align:middle line:84%
individual rights, which
is what it was intended

01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:17.970 align:middle line:90%
to do in the first place.

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the point is, by
having these strategies what's

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
emerged for us is
really principles

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.700 align:middle line:90%
rather than politics.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you
think about how many

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
places in our communities
right now that that spraying is

01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:32.170 align:middle line:84%
taking place, that the
chemtrails are taking place.

01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And what can we
really do about it?

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.190 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing about this
in your own lives, personally?

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
How do you live differently
knowing all that you know?

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, we
live in the country.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.750 align:middle line:84%
We have an organic
garden and orchard.

01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:52.672 align:middle line:84%
We have access to
our own clean water,

01:20:52.672 --> 01:20:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and the-- close to
90% of our electricity

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:58.790 align:middle line:90%
is supplied by solar now.

01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to that
being free energy in the future.

01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And we've gotten to
know our neighbors,

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and we have a
neighborhood association.

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And most of them have
watched "THRIVE,"

01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and we're encouraging people
in their neighborhoods

01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to organize for the worst
that may happen because we're

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.740 align:middle line:84%
looking at potential
financial collapse,

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.480 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
food collapse, we're

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.780 align:middle line:84%
looking at environmental
collapse, and so forth.

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
To plan as best as
possible, individually

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.824 align:middle line:84%
and as communities, for
that, and then do everything

01:21:29.824 --> 01:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
you can to make sure
that that doesn't happen.

01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But how would you
plan for that in a community?

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Like give me an example of
what your neighborhood's doing.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, to organize
around who has access to water?

01:21:39.610 --> 01:21:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Who has access to food?

01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
How would we protect
ourselves if marauders are out

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and there ends up being
violence, and so forth?

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
How can we use
what we can provide

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:54.880 align:middle line:84%
to take care of people
in our community?

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, in Santa
Cruz, we have access

01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
to one of the
largest natural foods

01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:01.190 align:middle line:90%
growing areas in the country.

01:22:01.190 --> 01:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
But in major cities where they
don't have access to that,

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:05.660 align:middle line:84%
it could be a
significant problems.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
The main thing, I think, is
for people to get out of debt

01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:12.710 align:middle line:84%
as much as they possibly
can, have some supplies.

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, really get
to know your neighbors,

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and be creating old fashioned
communities where people--

01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:20.300 align:middle line:84%
not old fashioned
technology, but old fashioned

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:22.310 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of we
actually know each other,

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:23.500 align:middle line:90%
we're building trust.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.047 align:middle line:84%
We know how we're going to
help take care of each other

01:22:26.047 --> 01:22:27.880 align:middle line:84%
if and when we need to
because that's useful

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.670 align:middle line:90%
no matter what happens.

01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm
curious-- I'm sorry--

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.134 align:middle line:84%
why would you say to get out
of debt before you would say

01:22:32.134 --> 01:22:34.200 align:middle line:84%
to maintain your own
personal survival?

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Why would you say that?

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GAMBLE: Well, just because
the more in debt you are,

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:38.550 align:middle line:90%
the more you can be controlled.

01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And those people who
are losing their houses

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:42.390 align:middle line:84%
through these financial
schemes are experiencing

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
very quickly-- They
thought it was their home,

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
but it turns out no, the
bank, who didn't put up

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%

>>CARTER GAMBLE: And
it is one of the things

01:22:55.563 --> 01:22:56.780 align:middle line:90%
that we want to be providing.

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
At thrivemovement.com we have
something called critical mass

You know, the safety and
effectiveness of numbers.

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So that if a million
people sign up

01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
to do an audit and end
to the Federal Reserve,

01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:10.369 align:middle line:90%
that's different than 100.

01:23:10.369 --> 01:23:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you can sign
up and say, well,

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:14.326 align:middle line:84%
when a million people have
signed up I'm in, or something.

01:23:14.326 --> 01:23:16.540 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want to talk
about on a local level

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.560 align:middle line:84%
is what Catherine
Austin Fitts-- she

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.067 align:middle line:84%
has Solari, which is a
fabulous organization.

01:23:22.067 --> 01:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things she's
gone around and set up

01:23:24.150 --> 01:23:26.066 align:middle line:84%
in some communities is
a way where, let's say,

01:23:26.066 --> 01:23:29.330 align:middle line:84%
one person has credit card
debt and another person

01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:31.620 align:middle line:90%
has money to invest.

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So the person in
the neighborhood

01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
pays off the credit card--
the person with money

01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
pays off the credit card
debt and then the debt

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.860 align:middle line:84%
becomes between the
people in the community.

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's 5% rather than
17%, which is a good investment

01:23:45.570 --> 01:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
amount, and it makes it
doable for the person.

01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Or another thing that
she's come up with--

01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:50.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great idea.

01:23:50.845 --> 01:23:52.386 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE:
--these mutual funds

01:23:52.386 --> 01:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
where, let's say, we invest in
our local Boys & Girls Club,

01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:58.170 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, so that
the better that a program does,

01:23:58.170 --> 01:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
then you get financial
return on that.

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So rather than requiring these
local businesses that really

01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:06.030 align:middle line:84%
help our communities go
out to these crummy banks

01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and get their loans and
give them all their money,

01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
instead, you can do that with
local community members, one

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:13.340 align:middle line:90%
to another.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.470 align:middle line:90%
And people are doing that.

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:16.050 align:middle line:90%
And Solari's an example of that.

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of those are
listed on our website,

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and people can tell us--

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:19.590 align:middle line:90%

in every way that we can.

There's a group that I
know in our community that

01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:58.980 align:middle line:90%
has a rolling fund.

01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So one family will
get this $500 a month.

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, if they need
to purchase something

01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:07.800 align:middle line:84%
that's major, or something, and
then they will pay it forward.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And each person puts
in $500 into the pot,

01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:11.434 align:middle line:84%
and one family takes
it for that month.

01:25:11.434 --> 01:25:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And the next money you put it
into the pot, and the family

01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:14.280 align:middle line:90%
takes that.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.071 align:middle line:84%
So if they have something
that they haven't

01:25:16.071 --> 01:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
been able to get to,
like a medical concern,

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.060 align:middle line:84%
or something that
they need to purchase,

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
they get that chunk
of money every month,

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.616 align:middle line:84%
or once a month within the
year to be able to make that.

01:25:26.616 --> 01:25:27.990 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different systems

I'm convinced

01:26:00.230 --> 01:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
it's going to get worse

01:26:02.530 --> 01:26:05.552 align:middle line:84%
You hear one corporate media
news show after another saying,

01:26:05.552 --> 01:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
well, we think there's
signs of recovery.

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And they'll pull out some
little doctored detail,

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
but there's no sound
economic reason whatsoever

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
why printing
trillions of dollars

01:26:15.150 --> 01:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and giving them to
the bankers is somehow

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:20.770 align:middle line:84%
going to help a real
economy re-emerge.

01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:22.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm
encouraging people

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.510 align:middle line:84%
to not only prepare
for that, but keep

01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
building the organic, wholesome
systems, economic systems,

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:35.240 align:middle line:84%
trade systems, energy systems,
communications systems,

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that we would
want to see, like that vision.

01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.930 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people
building those systems already

01:26:40.930 --> 01:26:44.310 align:middle line:84%
because when the old system
crumbles, and it will.

01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:46.600 align:middle line:90%
It cannot survive.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.700 align:middle line:90%
It is a confidence game.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a con game,
like our economy,

01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing behind
the dollar anymore.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
confidence of people,

01:26:57.490 --> 01:26:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and that's just about gone.

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So as that comes
down, if we've already

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.830 align:middle line:84%
got these other systems
emerging, which is what I see,

01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:08.260 align:middle line:84%
then it will have the freedom
to take place rather than go

01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
into the sort of
police state that

01:27:10.210 --> 01:27:12.520 align:middle line:84%

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:24.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about principles
that transcend politics.

01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately,
what's happening now--

01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
because we really
set out to create--

01:29:29.290 --> 01:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to empower a self-creating
movement around the world--

01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
is Thrive solutions groups
are spontaneously springing up

01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:40.890 align:middle line:84%
in cities all over this
country, and in other countries

01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:42.700 align:middle line:90%
around the world on their own.

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:46.686 align:middle line:84%
And then, using the
Thrive solutions model

01:29:46.686 --> 01:29:48.310 align:middle line:84%
that Kimberly mentioned
before, that we

01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
used with the moth spray
fiasco, and it allows people

01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:57.720 align:middle line:84%
in communities to focus
on, by sector and then

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
by individual issue, and
what their own passion is,

01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and then to coordinate their
activities and their resources.

01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we can help them
link to the other cities,

01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:09.640 align:middle line:90%
by sectors and by resources.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.560 align:middle line:84%
You really have
covered a lot of it.

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.186 align:middle line:84%
That's very, very
important that model.

01:30:13.186 --> 01:30:14.435 align:middle line:90%
So you could see how it works.

01:30:14.435 --> 01:30:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It's interactive.

01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
You can-- it leads you
to different places.

01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
That's a very in-depth
model with a lot of layers.

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you both.

01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you both so much.

01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
My goal here was to
bring about awareness

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and to bring about
the visuals that

01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:30.220 align:middle line:84%
support the hope
into the future.

01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:33.240 align:middle line:84%
More than just hope, but things
that are practical solutions.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And I really, really, deeply
appreciate you doing this film.

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:37.747 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:30:37.747 --> 01:30:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GAMBLE: You are welcome.

01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:40.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no better
example than this

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.360 align:middle line:84%
of the power of
independent media.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.860 align:middle line:90%
So thanks for the opportunity.

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER GAMBLE:
Thank you very much.

01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You are absolutely
right about that.

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you both very much.

01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:50.014 align:middle line:84%
Thank you both very-- well, all
of you very much for watching.

01:30:50.014 --> 01:30:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Watch the movie.
