00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And we are broadcasting from
the Sounds True Wake Up Festival

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.570 align:middle line:84%
at the beautiful
YMCA of the Rockies

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.470 align:middle line:90%
in Estes Park, Colorado.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And our current
technology-loving culture

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.600 align:middle line:90%
may value youth as being wise.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And many jobs are going to
the younger demographic.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
However, according to my
guest, an enrolled member

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Lakota tribe,
Joseph Marshall III,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:84%
he says, there are wise
people in the world,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
from all walks of life, from
many nations and cultures.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But there is one
unalterable reality.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.991 align:middle line:84%
No one who is truly
wise is young.

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JOSEPH MARSHALL: Thank you.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you
for being here.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.276 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Thank you.

00:00:50.276 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me, what do you
feel about how we're treating

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
our elders, in terms of
our society these days?

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Not good,
not good at all.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
We put them out
to pasture, which

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
is a common phrase
that people use.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's a convenient
phrase, but it's also

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
very sad one, as far
as I'm concerned,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
because it implies
that we no longer have

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.572 align:middle line:90%
any use for the old people.

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
wisdom that comes

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
from elders, from
all of our elders,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:90%
is so vast and so wonderful.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But our technology
age is moving so fast

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.285 align:middle line:84%
that often that
wisdom is discounted.

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: It is.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: I think we're
too enamored with the present

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:84%
moment and what we can
do with our technology.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And we forget that
our grandparents, even

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:84%
some of our parents, who have
lived 50, 60, 70 years or more

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:84%
have not just a lot of
wisdom, but a lot of-- not

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot of knowledge, but
a lot of wisdom because

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of all those years of just
having survived those years.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
They've gained a
lot of experience,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.566 align:middle line:84%
and that counts for
something, and that's

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:90%
what we forget about.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.814 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, we
forget about it,

00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:90%
because we are moving so fast.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's part
of your mission is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
to bring the information
forward and to keep it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:90%
and the traditions alive.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Yes,
that's what I do.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's what you do.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
So what are some
of the traditions

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that you want us
to know the most?

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Share with us.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Well there's a lot.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, without divulging
too many intimate secrets,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:90%
it's not so much tradition.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
It's values, values of respect,
compassion, humility, courage,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
all those things
that are actually

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
at the core of a
lot of cultures.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But I grew up
knowing those values

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
because my grandparents who
raised me not only taught them,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:90%
but they lived those values.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to
all the other things,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
such as traditions and customs,
that's what I try to teach.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And those things have a place
in the world, even today.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's break them down,
if you can, because they're

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
very important--
respect, passion.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:90%
What was the other two?

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Humility,
wisdom, generosity, courage,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:90%
fortitude--

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.297 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So respect--
respecting each other?

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Respecting each
other, respecting everything

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
around us-- it's not just
human to human relationship.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's everything
else in the world.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.260 align:middle line:84%
We say, everyone else, and
that implies human beings.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.955 align:middle line:84%
But everyone else also includes
all other forms of life,

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:90%
whether it's trees or animals.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And they deserve respect
too, because they're alive,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.305 align:middle line:90%
just as much as we are.

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and there's
a phrase that you have.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:90%
You could say it.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.745 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Mitakuye oyasin,
which means all my relatives,

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:90%
all my relations.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And is that what you
mean by relating to everything?

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.973 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Exactly.

00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:50.057 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All my relations.

00:03:50.057 --> 00:03:52.265 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: The Earth and
everything on it and in it.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now passion, passion
being another value--

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Right.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Passion for life?

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: For life.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Purpose?

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.235 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: All those
things, for purpose,

00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:04.580 align:middle line:84%
for even the smallest things
that come into our path

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:90%
as we go along.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It's, if you embrace
something with passion,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
it becomes more
meaningful, even if it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:90%
lasts for just a little while.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, let's talk
about that, if we can,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
for something that you
have passion about,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:90%
but it can't manifest.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Or someone you love, that
you have passion for,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:90%
who passes away.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.769 align:middle line:84%
It gets diminished a
little, doesn't it,

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
when those things happen?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Yeah, it does.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:90%
And it can, if you allow it.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:90%
But that's why we have memories.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can be passionate about
a person, an event, a thing,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:90%
a place.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you don't go
to that place anymore,

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:90%
or you leave that place.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Or someone passes in your life.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you
leave those behind.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
That's when you relegate
them to your memories.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going to a
wake with my grandparents

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:90%
when I was probably five or six.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.735 align:middle line:90%
It was a new experience for me.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I saw the person
lying in a casket.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they had died,
and they weren't moving.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And they'd looked like
the person I knew,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
but I knew it was-- there
was something different.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So I asked my grandfather,
where is she now.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Where is that person now?

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And so he touched my
chest and my head saying,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that person is now lives in
your heart and your mind.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you learn
those things, then you

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
can rekindle that passion for
what that person was to you.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you can't
hold on to them.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:90%
You can't touch them.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: And that's
just the way it is.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
That's a reality
of the situation.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why we
feel sad, because we can't

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
hold onto them,
can't touch them.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
We can't talk to them.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.486 align:middle line:84%
That's where sadness
and mourning comes in.

00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the process.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But memory can help with
a little bit of that.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's part of
process is the mourning.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It takes a while to grieve.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Right.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:90%
How long do you think?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know there's not
a certain amount of years,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
but how do you go through
that grieving process

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.395 align:middle line:90%
without disabling your life?

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: I don't know.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a tough question.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.544 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all go
through it as individuals.

00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And it all depends
on what we were

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
taught as young people,
what our societies

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and what our cultures
talk about or teach us,

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:90%
as far as life and death.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
My particular
culture, the Lakota,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
we are not afraid to talk
about death, because it's

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
a part of the cycle of being
born, living our lives,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
being children, being
adults, and being old people.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Then we die.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:90%
And we're taught that.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what is coming.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to
change that reality,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:84%

And one of the
first things-- one

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
of the things that I didn't like
to do as a child and in school

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:90%
was to talk in front of people.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in high
school, I took a speech class.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:90%
I had to.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the first test was to
give a three-minute speech.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the most
terrifying moments of my life,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:90%
up to that point in my life.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And I did it in

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and my grandparents said,
well, you have to do.

-[SPEAKING LAKOTA]

00:09:56.481 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:84%
My name is Joseph Marshall,
and I'm Rosebud Sioux.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.854 align:middle line:84%
I grew up on a Sioux Indian
reservation in the 1950s,

00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
during a time when
they were still

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:90%
a lot of traditional families.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.039 align:middle line:84%
And many of those traditional
families spoke Lakota.

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And many of the elderly
members of those families

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.163 align:middle line:84%
had stories to tell,
especially in the winter time

00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:90%
or at some social gathering.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.024 align:middle line:84%
Invariably, when
people got together,

00:10:18.024 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:84%
some elderly person would
call the children together

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and tell stories about culture,
about history, about ancestors.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And those kinds of
stories were the basis

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:90%
for my book, "The Lakota Way."

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to show,
to demonstrate,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that the Lakota culture is a
vibrant, alive culture today

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and that it has a
connection to the past.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the virtues
that I write about

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.730 align:middle line:84%
are just as applicable
today as they ever were.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of books
out on the market today

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
written by non-Indians,
with titles like,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
"The Last of the Mohicans" or
"The Last Days of the Sioux

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Nation," which imply those
cultures or those tribes

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:90%
no longer exist.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And nothing can be
further from the truth.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Certainly, Lakota still exists.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we exist in greater
numbers than we did before.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
We exist today
within the structure

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:84%
of the dominant society, the
dominant American society.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't entirely
forgotten who we are

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and what we are.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So the stories in
"The Lakota Way"

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
come from that identity of
ourselves as a Lakota people.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
There were very few
radios when I was a boy,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:90%
and of course, no televisions.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And Lakota was the
predominant language.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Stories were entertainment
and education.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
mechanism by which

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
the Lakota culture
perpetuated itself.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
The storytellers in my
childhood were the grandmothers

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and grandfathers
who had lived life

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and learned a thing or two
from living and from stories.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I come from an oral
tradition, and as the author

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
of a book, who sits down at
a computer or at a typewriter

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and bangs out words, that's
one way of telling a story.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.035 align:middle line:84%
But because I come
from an oral tradition,

00:12:03.035 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
it stood to reason--
it made a lot of sense

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.619 align:middle line:84%
to take some of the stories
from this latest book

00:12:08.619 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:90%

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.862 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
reason to be wise.

00:14:03.862 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or the right decision
is made, within the mistakes.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Exactly.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like there's
one gem in the rough.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.446 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Right.

00:14:09.446 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I think, part of the
wisdom in the elder part

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:84%
is that we've made so many
mistakes up to this point.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Absolutely, right.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It's sort of
akin to the adage, "Whatever

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
doesn't kill you will
make you stronger."

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And give you humility.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Right.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
All your mistakes are the
foundation for lessons.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:90%
They are the lessons.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, another guideline--
"A wise person never

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
speaks before immersing
himself or herself

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
in a long, thoughtful moment,"
which I notice that you do.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.055 align:middle line:84%
You shorten it a little
because of the interview.

00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Right, I
mean it's-- exactly.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Don't let your mouth run off,
before your thoughts catch up

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.730 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing wrong
with gathering your thoughts,

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
say the right thing.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:84%
You want to impart
the right information.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You want to provide the
right kind of wisdom

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
or answer the question
in the right way.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My husband is like that.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
He takes his time
to answer things.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And I jump in, because I've
got this busy mind, I jump in,

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and I answer it for him.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And it bugs him.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
He really likes to take
his time, and you as well.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Is this something
that you practice?

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: No.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.677 align:middle line:84%
I probably do, probably
subconsciously,

00:15:26.677 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:90%
more than I realize.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.999 align:middle line:84%
But it's the example set by my
parents and my grandparents.

00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you were
raised like this.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.969 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: I was
raised that way,

00:15:33.969 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
with people who were very
careful about what they said,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.385 align:middle line:90%
took the time to think.

00:15:37.385 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there a process
that people in your community

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:90%
go through, young generation.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:84%
When they turn 13 or they
move into being a young adult,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is there still a-- an
indoctrination or ceremony,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.065 align:middle line:84%
anything that, when you become
a teenager, in your community?

00:15:56.065 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It is
still, for girls.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.626 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, good.

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It's a
coming-out ceremony,

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.295 align:middle line:90%
it's a puberty ceremony.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's it called?

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It's a
puberty ceremony,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.830 align:middle line:90%
a coming-out ceremony.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
When they reach
puberty, then they're

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.396 align:middle line:84%
recognized by the community,
saying that you are now

00:16:08.396 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:84%
a woman, and this is
your role in our family,

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:90%
in our community.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.835 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it was done.

00:16:13.835 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It was more extensive in the
old days, pre-reservation days.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:90%
There was a large gathering.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And there was a feast.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And the young woman or
young women were identified,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and their families
were identified.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was their moment to
pass from being girls to women.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
deal, because women

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:90%
were the focal point of family.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they were the
focal point of the community.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
They were the
nurturers, and they

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
were the first
teachers of children.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was important for
them to know their roles,

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.982 align:middle line:84%
to have learned their
roles and then implement

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:49.065 align:middle line:90%
what was expected of them.

00:16:49.065 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are there any modern
day ceremonies like that?

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.206 align:middle line:90%
Does your tribe or anyone--

00:16:54.206 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Yeah, the
ceremony is still done,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
maybe not to the extent that
it used to be in the old days.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Not as many families do it.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who are still
traditional, some families

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:90%
do that still.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you do that for
other, say, other cultures?

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.748 align:middle line:90%
Could you--

00:17:11.748 --> 00:17:13.289 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Yeah,
we could, probably.

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Religions have that.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.438 align:middle line:90%
But if you're not religious--

00:17:15.438 --> 00:17:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Yeah, we could have.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I probably have seen one or
two that were done that way.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's so lost in
the American culture.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: It is.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:23.845 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so lost.

00:17:23.845 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it still exists
in Hispanic culture

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and the Jewish faith,
many different religions.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But in the overarching
American culture--

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: It isn't there.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No, it's been lost.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think it contributes
to many young women

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:84%
today not understanding
their sexuality

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
or what to do with it or
the power that it yields.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:84%
If they understood the
power that it yields,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
it would be more
protected and preserved.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
My own personal opinion,
but I have a young girl.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So I get to look at
things like that.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Another guideline is, "Wisdom
is the most effective antidote

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
to fear and the
absence of reason."

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Right.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom is hard
earned, first of all.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you go through
so many experiences,

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
trying experiences,
trials and tribulations

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and just experiencing everything
else that goes on around you,

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:90%
in your path, in your life.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:84%
My father, for example, died at
the age of 77 of colon cancer.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But he was a veteran
of World War II.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:90%
He was a soldier.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:90%
He was in Okinawa.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And so just that
experience was the one

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:90%
that forged him into a man.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And so for the rest of his
life, he could look back on that

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.866 align:middle line:84%
and use that as a
source of wisdom,

00:18:42.866 --> 00:18:44.365 align:middle line:84%
because he survived
that experience.

00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about the wounds
that he carried over from that,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.787 align:middle line:90%
as a vet?

00:18:47.787 --> 00:18:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: There were a
lot of wounds he carried.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.578 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
he was an alcoholic,

00:18:51.578 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:90%
and he drank for 40 years.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know him as a
man, because of alcoholism.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
But when he finally quit, I came
to see him as he really was.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
He was a very kind,
compassionate, very

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.337 align:middle line:84%
knowledgeable person that
could engage in conversations

00:19:09.337 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:90%
about just about anything.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.132 align:middle line:90%
And I came to know him then.

00:19:12.132 --> 00:19:14.295 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how old
was he at that point.

00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:17.079 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: I think he was in
his 60s, when he finally quit.

00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When he
finally quit, and you

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:90%

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Right.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.555 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Many people, of
course, our Vietnam veterans

00:19:24.555 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and all veterans, carry
these torches over from war.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.070 align:middle line:90%
My father as well was a vet.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And it is something
that is so subtle

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:90%
that isn't recognized as much.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It is more now.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
But how do you deal with
that in your culture

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.272 align:middle line:90%
and not go towards the alcohol?

00:19:44.272 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: In the
pre-reservation days,

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
warriors were esteemed.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
being a warrior,

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:90%
a war fighter was necessary.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, a warrior
had to do difficult things,

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
to put it mildly, on
behalf of defending

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:84%
his family, his
community, his nation.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And the society
recognized that, so there

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
were rituals of cleansing
and accepting them

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:90%
back into the community.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And there was one that was
done where a ceremony was set.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.525 align:middle line:84%
A day was appointed,
and all the warriors

00:20:20.525 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
went outside the village
with their weapons.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And they came a
certain distance,

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:90%
and then they stopped.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:90%
And the laid down their weapons.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the village
was waiting for them.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And they walked backwards
into the village,

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning they left behind
all the things-- all

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
the terrible things
and their weapons.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And they walked
into the village.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And once they got
into the village,

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
they went into a sweat
lodge, many sweat lodges,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and they were cleansed
of all of that.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they were wiped down,
washed by their families.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And then their weapons
were smudged as well.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.755 align:middle line:84%
So their weapons were
cleansed as well.

00:20:54.755 --> 00:20:57.374 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a very intense
ceremony and important.

00:20:57.374 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Absolutely

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this
happened several times.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Several times-- it
was a ceremony of forgiveness,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
mainly of the warriors forgiving
themselves, just as importantly

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:90%
as the people forgiving them.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
forgiving the war and all

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:90%
that they had to fight for?

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.871 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It was all
part of the process.

00:21:14.871 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
That's part of life,
but sometimes we

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:90%
have to put it in its place.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A few times, you
said, pre-reservation days.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Right.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What do you
mean by that period?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.214 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL:
Reservations, for us,

00:21:24.214 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:84%
started about 1860s, when
the first Lakota were

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
taken to the areas around
Fort Robinson, Nebraska,

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
after some of them had
surrendered to white authority.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:84%
In 1877 is when we were moved
to western South Dakota.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
reservations were established.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So when I mentioned
pre-reservation,

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.865 align:middle line:84%
it was in a time before we
were relegated to reservations.

00:21:48.865 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's talk
about this perspective,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.654 align:middle line:90%
about when the West was lost.

00:21:52.654 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: How
the West was lost.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How West was lost.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: The overriding
perspective-- and there

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
was a movie titled,
"How the West Was Won."

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a long, long movie.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was
all from the perspective

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:90%
of the Europeans.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, natives
were in the movie.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But the theme was what
the mainstream society

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
did to win the West, because
they were the good guys.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And it espoused
mostly their virtues

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and how-- what it
took to claim the land

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and to make it into
what it is today.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But what it really
didn't talk about,

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and what a lot of books
and novels and movies

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
don't talk about, is
what happened to us

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
How did we feel about
that whole process?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
If the West was won for somebody
else, it was lost for our side.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Our lives were changed forever.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
In the Oregon Trail
days, for 20 years,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:84%
350,000 white people
traveled from Missouri

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:84%
to California and Oregon,
through many different--

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:84%
the territories of
many different tribes.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:90%
That's mentioned in that way.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
But it never talks about, well,
what happened to those people.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:90%
How did they feel about it?

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine along
the North Platte River,

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
where the Oregon Trail ran in
Wyoming, of Lakota men and boys

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the ridges
watching the wagons

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.780 align:middle line:84%
roll by, every summer, hundreds
and hundreds of wagons.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:24.007 align:middle line:84%
And you had to-- you had to know
that those men and boys were

00:23:24.007 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
wondering, well, who
are those people.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Where are they going?

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen to them?

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But the more
important question--

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen to us?

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, as
they move into--

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: As they
move into our lands,

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.571 align:middle line:90%
what are they doing here?

00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Why do they want our land?

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the process, our
buffalo was being killed,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.925 align:middle line:90%
were being wiped out.

00:23:44.925 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why, because
of the danger?

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: No, the buffalo hide
hunters came and shot buffalo,

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.916 align:middle line:84%
from long distances with
high caliber rifles.

00:23:54.916 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Buffalo have a strange habit.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
When one is killed,
they all gather around.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.641 align:middle line:84%
So the hide hunters
learned that habit.

00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So when they shot one, the
others would gather around,

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and they would keep
shooting one after another.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.985 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why was the
buffalo hide so valuable?

00:24:06.985 --> 00:24:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It was used for
all kinds of things back East,

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:84%
for rugs and so forth,
and the bones later on.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:90%
And the tongues were a delicacy.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
carcasses was discarded.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So those were the effects
of all those people coming.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And nobody ever talks
about how we felt about it.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.980 align:middle line:84%
There was a scene in the
movie "Dances with Wolves"

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.275 align:middle line:84%
where the Lakota people
come on the carcasses of all

00:24:34.275 --> 00:24:37.715 align:middle line:84%
the dead buffalo that were
left behind, skinned carcasses.

00:24:37.715 --> 00:24:39.710 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of what
happened to us.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We were just sort of cast
aside by the whole concept

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
of Manifest Destiny and
the people moving West.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't good for us.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How did you feel?

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.575 align:middle line:90%
What happened within the tribe?

00:24:55.575 --> 00:25:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: A lot of
feelings-- anger, sadness

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.232 align:middle line:84%
and trying to change,
trying to stop it,

00:25:05.232 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:84%
initially trying
to stop it, trying

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to do something about it, but
there was no way to do that,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
because there were too
many of those people

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:18.336 align:middle line:84%
and not enough of us to mount
an effective resistance.

00:25:18.336 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Plus, you lived in the
gentle way, with the Earth,

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:90%
not taking over the Earth.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Yeah, and there
was the opposing viewpoints.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Where our culture looked
at the Earth as a relative,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and we belonged to the Earth.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And the other side
looked at it as property,

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.155 align:middle line:84%
as a commodity, something
to own and something

00:25:38.155 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:90%
to use and discard.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.765 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were there
ever omens at the time?

00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:90%
There was plague.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:84%
There were are many
different things that-- would

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.236 align:middle line:84%
your culture look at as a
way of eradicating that.

00:25:51.236 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:90%
But it was just too strong.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It was
just too strong.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.593 align:middle line:90%
There were too many.

00:25:54.593 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:90%
It was an issue of numbers.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.886 align:middle line:84%
We were taught in
history-- at least

00:26:00.886 --> 00:26:04.007 align:middle line:84%
I assumed from what I learned
in history, that the way

00:26:04.007 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:84%
people thought of
themselves as better, that

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:84%
was the main reason
they won and we lost.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't that.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:90%
It was numbers.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.685 align:middle line:90%
They had more guns.

00:26:13.685 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:84%
There was more
technology on their side.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-1800s, the American
population was 25 million.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.355 align:middle line:84%
And the Lakota population
was about 25,000.

00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: And even all
the 60 tribes of the planes

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:90%
only was about 300 thousand.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So the numbers were
not in our favor.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.372 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And do
you feel that that

00:26:33.372 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
has permeated the

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.495 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: In
many ways, it has.

00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:38.911 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Never
recovered from that.

00:26:38.911 --> 00:26:40.929 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: No, and we're
still, in many ways,

00:26:40.929 --> 00:26:41.720 align:middle line:90%
struggling with it.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.934 align:middle line:90%
We know what the history is.

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:90%
We know what the outcome is.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
their jobs are being

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.575 align:middle line:84%
their houses are being

>>MARSHALL: It's an
interesting question.

00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.536 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'm

But there is one truth.

Change is inevitable.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, though,
the change is forced.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.786 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a

00:27:25.786 --> 00:27:27.660 align:middle line:84%

So the only thing to

00:27:32.636 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a phrase in my
language that my parents

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and grandparents
used a lot when I

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.067 align:middle line:84%
complained about
how things were.

00:27:39.067 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they would say,
they would throw it back at me

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and say, that's
the way things are.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.780 align:middle line:90%
First of all, you accept it.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you decide what about
it you can change and what

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.690 align:middle line:90%
about it you just can't.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:90%
And you work with what you can.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And if this is the way
it is for the moment,

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.280 align:middle line:84%
then we deal with it
and look for a way

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:84%
around it, through it,
over it, and just accept

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:03.290 align:middle line:90%
it to begin with.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I am Sichangu Lakota, descended
from a people who were nomadic

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
hunters on the Northern
Plains of North America.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we developed a
strong spiritual relationship

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.900 align:middle line:84%
with the bison or
buffalo, we called

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:84%
ourselves Pte Oyate,
the Buffalo Nation.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.659 align:middle line:84%
There were seven
bands of the Lakota:

00:29:29.659 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Ogalala, Sicangu, Hunkpapa,
Miniconjou, Sihasapa,

Itazipacola, and Oohenupa.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.440 align:middle line:84%
By 1850, we controlled
a territory larger

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.480 align:middle line:84%
than most European
nations at the time.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:84%
My ancestors were proficient
hunters and warriors,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:84%
efficiently providing
a living for themselves

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and defending family and nation.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:84%
For hundreds and
hundreds of years,

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
their primary weapon
for hunting and warfare

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:02.800 align:middle line:84%
was this, a simple

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.510 align:middle line:84%

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.462 align:middle line:84%
What type of wood do
you make them out of?

00:31:11.462 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Ash--
any kind of hardwood,

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:84%
flexible hardwood
is good for a bow.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And I learned it, obviously,
from my grandfather,

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.219 align:middle line:84%
who made bows and arrows
and taught me the basics.

00:31:22.219 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:90%
And I took it from there.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you take a chunk
of wood, and you carve the--

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.581 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Yeah, you
take-- it's called a stave.

00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
You harvest a tree that's
no larger than your forearm,

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:90%
about six feet long.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.290 align:middle line:84%
You split it in two
or four, if you can.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And you let that cure
for several years.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.390 align:middle line:90%
And then you carve it.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.960 align:middle line:84%
You literally carve
it into a bow.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:84%
We are told that our
bow, our Lakota bow,

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:90%
came to us from the moon.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:90%
And you see it all the time.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
You've probably seen
it, and you don't know.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Every time you see
the thinnest sliver

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.054 align:middle line:90%
of a new moon, that's our bow.

00:31:58.054 --> 00:31:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the shape, it's

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:84%
tapered gracefully,
from end to end.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
we make our bows.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And since the moon is
female, our bow is female.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you do it right,
if you make a right,

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:84%
if it's good enough--
and hopefully,

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.838 align:middle line:84%
after all these years,
I'm getting to the point

00:32:14.838 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:84%
where I'm good
enough-- you can make

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.680 align:middle line:90%
a bow that's very resilient.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.150 align:middle line:84%
You can use it time
after time after time.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Even no matter how
many times you bend it,

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.932 align:middle line:84%
it will go back to
its original shape.

00:32:25.932 --> 00:32:27.015 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And it's flexible.

00:32:27.015 --> 00:32:28.556 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It's
very, very flexible.

00:32:28.556 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so what
lessons in life

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:84%
do you teach from
that flexibility?

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.168 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: We need
to be flexible.

00:32:33.168 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:84%
We need to adjust to
things that happen to us.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And just even if
something knocks us back,

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
we can return from that
knock down, as it were,

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and just be resilient
like the bow is.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.585 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no matter how
many times you bend it,

00:32:47.585 --> 00:32:50.520 align:middle line:84%
it always wants to go back
to its original shape.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about the arrow?

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:57.095 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: The arrow comes from
the sun, the rays of the sun.

00:32:57.095 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen the
sun's rays coming down

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:84%
through a bank of clouds,
arrows need to be that straight.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:90%
So the moon gave us the bow.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.400 align:middle line:90%
The sun gave us the arrow.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's male and female.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.910 align:middle line:84%
One is not useful
with the other.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.620 align:middle line:84%
One doesn't fulfill its
purpose without the other.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.952 align:middle line:84%
But the arrow, in
order to be accurate,

00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:16.660 align:middle line:84%
has to be as straight
as you can make it.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.812 align:middle line:90%
It has to be perfectly straight.

00:33:18.812 --> 00:33:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not straight,
doesn't matter how strong

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.152 align:middle line:84%
the bow is, it's not
going to hit the target.

00:33:25.152 --> 00:33:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what do you
make the arrows out of?

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Arrows are made
out of stalks, slender stalks.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be the
branch of an ash tree.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.471 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be the willow stalk.

00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:36.845 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be
chokecherry stalk.

00:33:36.845 --> 00:33:39.525 align:middle line:84%
It has to be the right size, the
size of a man's little finger.

00:33:39.525 --> 00:33:41.435 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what
about the point of it?

00:33:41.435 --> 00:33:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: In the beginning,
the points were stone.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a stone called flint.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty common
in North America.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy to flake.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:49.340 align:middle line:90%
You work it.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.110 align:middle line:84%
You break off a piece, and then
you, with pressure flaking it,

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.560 align:middle line:90%
you shape the head.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.935 align:middle line:84%
That's a simple
way of describing

00:33:55.935 --> 00:33:57.430 align:middle line:90%
a complicated process.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:58.870 align:middle line:90%
But that's how it happens.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, of course,
when the Europeans came

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and they brought
with them iron, then

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.610 align:middle line:84%
we used iron for the
heads, for the points.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
what the arrowhead is.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.410 align:middle line:84%
What is the symbolism
of the arrowhead?

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: It's a point.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:16.179 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's sharp.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:22.219 align:middle line:84%
And it's anything
that's straight.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And it symbolizes that
we have to go forward.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.130 align:middle line:90%

00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:33.830 align:middle line:84%
other than the
bow and the arrow,

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.718 align:middle line:84%
that you carry through
to modern day society?

00:34:38.718 --> 00:34:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Just by
trying to remember

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.980 align:middle line:84%
what my grandparents
taught me and my parents,

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:84%
not just my immediate
grandparents, but all

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
the people who were
Grandma and Grandpa to me

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.002 align:middle line:84%
in the communities
where I grew up,

00:34:54.002 --> 00:34:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to remember what they taught
me and to live those values

00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:59.809 align:middle line:90%
as much as I can.

00:34:59.809 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:90%
I go to ceremonies.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do, still?

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: I do.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.225 align:middle line:90%
I go to ceremonies.

00:35:03.225 --> 00:35:05.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you go to
the sweat lodges still?

00:35:05.058 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: I do
sweat lodges, yes.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:84%
One of my nephews
is a medicine man,

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.784 align:middle line:84%
so I like to go
to his ceremonies.

00:35:10.784 --> 00:35:11.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And participate--

00:35:11.825 --> 00:35:13.033 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: And participate--

00:35:13.033 --> 00:35:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell us about the
sweat lodges that you go to.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Sweat lodge
is somewhat of a misnomer.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.640 align:middle line:90%
We call it the inipi.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.860 align:middle line:90%
It means sort of a rebirth.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you go in there, and
what it is, it's a wet sauna.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.675 align:middle line:90%
It's a dome-shaped structure.

00:35:29.675 --> 00:35:31.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not very high.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.920 align:middle line:90%
And it can hold up to 20 people.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And there's a center pit.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And inside that pit is where
the stones are brought in

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:84%
from the outside,
from the outside fire

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.840 align:middle line:90%
pit where the stones are heated.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.054 align:middle line:90%
And they're brought in.

00:35:43.054 --> 00:35:44.220 align:middle line:90%
And then the door is closed.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:90%
The door is usually to the west.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's dark inside.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And water-- the
medicine man pours

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.090 align:middle line:90%
the water over the stones.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And it gets very,
very hot inside.

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's a wet sauna.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's usually four
rounds of prayers and singing.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And everybody who sits in
there has an opportunity

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
to make a statement,
say a prayer,

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.760 align:middle line:84%
say the reason he
or she is there.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, the doors open, and
we're given a brief respite.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:90%
And then the door is closed.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And we do that four times.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's very refreshing.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.632 align:middle line:90%
You sweat.

00:36:18.632 --> 00:36:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a wet sauna, so
you sweat profusely.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
doing symbolically

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.395 align:middle line:84%
is getting rid of a
lot of negativity.

00:36:25.395 --> 00:36:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the prayers are
around whatever the intention

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.777 align:middle line:90%
is of that--

00:36:28.777 --> 00:36:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Each person is
there for a different reason.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.992 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be for
one specific reason

00:36:32.992 --> 00:36:34.450 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is
participating in.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.610 align:middle line:84%
But usually, people come
and have particular cares

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and concerns that
they pray about.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you come and
pray for-- have there

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.602 align:middle line:84%
been recent ones
that have ever been

00:36:43.602 --> 00:36:45.060 align:middle line:84%
about the environment
or the Earth?

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:45.726 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Yes.

00:36:45.726 --> 00:36:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, yes, that happens.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And sweat
lodges got a bad name,

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:53.480 align:middle line:84%
of course, when they
had the incident that

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.555 align:middle line:84%
happened to that one
particular gentleman.

00:36:55.555 --> 00:36:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But that was, in your way,
different from what you do,

00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.384 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Oh, yeah.

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
To us, it's not a contest
of a how hot it can get.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not at all.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.520 align:middle line:84%
No, it had nothing
to do with that.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You take breaks when
you need to take breaks.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Yes.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's
about the intentions.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It's the
intentions, yeah.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In the
case that I did it,

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
there was our-- my
friend in the center.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And she was being prayed
over and chanted and sung to,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Yeah, the songs
are to invite the spirits in.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, when it's
over, the songs

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.125 align:middle line:84%
are to thank the
spirits for coming,

00:37:28.125 --> 00:37:29.124 align:middle line:90%
that happen to be there.

00:37:29.124 --> 00:37:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it wasn't
actually hot from the coals.

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just because of the room
and the energy that flowed

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.582 align:middle line:84%
and the drums and the
singing, and it's really

00:37:38.582 --> 00:37:39.540 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful experience.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: It is.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
wonderful experience.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Any other types of things
that you bring forward

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.200 align:middle line:84%
into today's society
from your culture?

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Just by being aware
of the environment, the Earth,

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and this is the class
I'm teaching here.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about the Earth
and how to live

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.520 align:middle line:84%
the sacred reality
of Mother Earth

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:90%
and trying to live that way.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.405 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: [COUGHING] I'm
sorry, what was that?

00:38:05.405 --> 00:38:06.863 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Trying
to live that way

00:38:06.863 --> 00:38:09.830 align:middle line:90%
and not do harm to the Earth.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Those are things
that, again, I learned

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:14.060 align:middle line:84%
from the community I grew
up in, from my grandparents

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:90%
and their contemporaries.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another picture
that I want to show your here

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.155 align:middle line:90%
or a video of keep going.

00:38:21.155 --> 00:38:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this, and we'll
talk about it in a second.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:27.860 align:middle line:90%


00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:34.200 align:middle line:84%
-Keep going-- a young man
asked his Lakota grandfather

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.430 align:middle line:84%
what the answer was to
life's difficulties.

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:42.720 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING LAKOTA], said
the old man, "keep going."

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, "there
are many realities in life,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.920 align:middle line:84%
such as joy and sadness,
winning and losing, standing

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and falling, plenty and
hunger, and good and bad.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate reality
is that life is a journey.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
walk it in sunlight

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.000 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes in shadow."

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
None of us asked to be
born, but we are here.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.215 align:middle line:84%
And we must walk our
journey with our strengths

00:39:17.215 --> 00:39:18.310 align:middle line:90%
and our weaknesses.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Within each of us
is the will to win,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
willingness to lose.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Or to put it another way, the
determination to face life

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:84%
or the fear to
turn away from it.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Life is not always easy.

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.670 align:middle line:84%
There are difficulties,
storms if you will,

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:47.120 align:middle line:84%
that bring loss, setbacks,
sadness, heartache,

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and disappointments
of every kind.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But every storm,
every difficulty,

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:55.605 align:middle line:90%
can also teach us to be strong.

00:39:55.605 --> 00:39:58.240 align:middle line:90%


00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.150 align:middle line:84%
To learn to be strong,
we must stand and face

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.590 align:middle line:84%
the storms and difficulties
that life throws at us.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It means crying when we need to.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.580 align:middle line:84%
But it also means to
keep looking for answers,

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.070 align:middle line:90%
to keep hoping.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:19.090 align:middle line:84%
It means to survive this moment
and the next and the next,

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:20.930 align:middle line:84%
until the darkness
passes, and the sun

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.800 align:middle line:90%
rises again, as it always will.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Life's journey is
like climbing a hill.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:34.050 align:middle line:84%
To reach the top, we must
do it one step at a time.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
We should always remember
that the smallest or weakest

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.460 align:middle line:84%
or slowest step
toward the sunrise,

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.250 align:middle line:84%
toward hope, toward
the top of the hill,

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:47.370 align:middle line:84%
is stronger than any
storm or difficulty.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And we should never forget that
the secret to determination

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:56.090 align:middle line:84%
is to keep going, no
matter how weary we may be

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:58.960 align:middle line:90%
or no matter what faces us.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Above all, we must keep going.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:07.597 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.597 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
lecture today, and you

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:84%
carry on the legacy

In what way?

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:20.780 align:middle line:84%
You said, the lecture today
specifically was around health?

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Around how
to regard the Earth.

Sorry.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.301 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: So you lecture

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And what is your purpose

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.075 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you
hope to bring forward?

00:41:36.075 --> 00:41:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: To create an

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.610 align:middle line:84%

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:43.770 align:middle line:90%
many of us.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:84%
There are more of
us now than used

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.910 align:middle line:84%
to be in the
pre-reservation days.

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.060 align:middle line:84%
In the 1800s, there may
have been 25,0000 of us.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, our Lakota population
is probably around 70,000.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of in comparison
with all the other people

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.510 align:middle line:84%
in the world, there
is not many of us.

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have a
lot of political clout.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So are-- we need to fall back on
awareness from people like you

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:08.820 align:middle line:90%
and the mainstream of society.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The more you know
about us, the more

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:90%
you'll hopefully understand us.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you will agree
with some of the things

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:84%
that we try to
espouse as a culture.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As we maybe
drive along a highway

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and we see "Indian
reservation" along the side,

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:28.510 align:middle line:84%
what would you like people to do
when they see the reservations?

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL:
Understand that we are

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.080 align:middle line:84%
like anybody else in
many, many respects.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And many of us do
want to hold on to who

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:84%
we are, our identity, our
languages, our traditions,

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.970 align:middle line:90%
our customs, and our land.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to have resources to
survive in this environment--

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:48.720 align:middle line:90%
capitalistic environment.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And we need industry
and jobs and things

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.390 align:middle line:84%
on every reservation,
everywhere,

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on the East or
West coast or in the middle.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're like any
other group of people.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But we're very nationalistic in
that we have a sense of pride

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.490 align:middle line:84%
in who we are and what we are
and a pride in our history

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.010 align:middle line:90%
and our values and our customs.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So to appreciate,
respect those customs

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and cultures, if we were
to enter into a reservation

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:17.664 align:middle line:84%
or in any way be a
part of it-- what

00:43:17.664 --> 00:43:19.080 align:middle line:84%
do you feel about
the casinos that

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.801 align:middle line:84%
are being built on
the reservations?

00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: I think that
they can do a lot of good.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was the intent,
when they were started,

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.830 align:middle line:84%
is to bring an income that
we can turn around and bring

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:35.120 align:middle line:84%
in some economic benefit
or social benefit

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.060 align:middle line:90%
to our own people.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Were they
designated certain areas?

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.642 align:middle line:84%
Was there a decision
that was made

00:43:40.642 --> 00:43:42.100 align:middle line:84%
amongst the Native
American culture

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.950 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a
certain amount of them?

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Or is it an individual--

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: It's
pretty much left up

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to each individual tribe
to work out agreements

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:84%
with the federal government
and with the states.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And how do
the tribes get along,

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.547 align:middle line:84%
the Lakota and the Chumansh and
all of the different tribes,

00:43:54.547 --> 00:43:55.630 align:middle line:90%
still getting along very--

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Now, we get along.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't always the
case, in the old days.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But now, we have to deal with
the same kinds of issues--

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.104 align:middle line:84%
economic development,
health, education, housing.

00:44:08.104 --> 00:44:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to deal
with all of those,

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.775 align:middle line:84%
so we band together and
try to work together.

00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When there's a
ceremony of a wedding--

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and you say that your
tribe is now about 70,000,

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:21.317 align:middle line:84%
does that mean they're pure
Lakota to Lakota marriages?

and non-natives and natives
in other native tribes.

00:44:45.052 --> 00:44:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I have a son who's
married to a Navajo.

they have a certain ceremony

that was set apart
from the village.

she was taken there by all the
other women and the midwife.

And she was assisted
in her birth.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And they did their rituals and
ceremonies and prayers, usually

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.480 align:middle line:90%
do the sweat before the birth.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.362 align:middle line:84%

Is there any particular

00:45:50.991 --> 00:45:53.540 align:middle line:84%

So we want to be part of the

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.420 align:middle line:90%
We have things to offer.

We have values.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.410 align:middle line:84%
the heritage and the

I keep asking about ceremony.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:30.310 align:middle line:84%
When you have pressure,
stress, financial issues,

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:34.090 align:middle line:84%
do you ever set intentions
through ceremony around that?

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.595 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a daily ritual?

00:46:35.595 --> 00:46:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: I
meditate every day,

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.230 align:middle line:84%
if it's nothing more

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:84%

as much-- as often as I can.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And I take part in a sweat
lodge as often as I can,

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:84%
because I can take my
troubles and my cares there.

And people of any culture
can do that sort of thing.

>>MARSHALL: It's mixed
emotion sort of a thing.

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, some

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.470 align:middle line:84%
of trying to portray
correctly history

every movie that

00:47:55.469 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:84%

>>MARSHALL: Just
the way we dressed,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.940 align:middle line:84%
were portrayed as
living in teepees.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They live in what?

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: Hogans, a
round earthen structure.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:14.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Abode structure.

00:48:14.995 --> 00:48:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Right.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there's
so much to learn still.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it's being
taught through history

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.910 align:middle line:90%
in schools, which is good.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.755 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, it's being
taught the right way.

00:48:24.755 --> 00:48:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Yes, one hopes.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.992 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's great to have
books now that we can access.

00:48:28.992 --> 00:48:30.825 align:middle line:84%
And the stories in your
books are wonderful.

00:48:30.825 --> 00:48:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MARSHALL: Great, thank you.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thank you for
sharing your culture

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.340 align:middle line:84%
with us, your
traditions with us.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.810 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being here.

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:38.435 align:middle line:84%
>>MARSHALL: I'm glad
to have been here.

00:48:38.435 --> 00:48:39.740 align:middle line:90%
