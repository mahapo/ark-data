00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The Passion Test is
a very powerful tool

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to help you discover what
you want in your life.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And joining me today
is Janet Attwood.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle line:84%
She's the co-creator
of the Passion Test.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And she's here to talk about
what it means to really live

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%
an adventure-filled life of
passion for what you absolutely

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:90%
love to do.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET ATTWOOD: Thanks, Lisa.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been so looking
forward to being with you.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm excited.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Because you're
the epitome of passion.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well--

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: So thank you.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.608 align:middle line:90%
Really, you really are.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You're the epitome of someone
who's living a passionate life.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
You're happy, you're up, you're
excited, you give energy,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're filled with
joy, so thank you.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.671 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love what I do.

00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:90%
I really--

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: That's clear.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I get to
talk with people like you.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So you, by the way,
Miss Visionary,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:84%
have created such an incredible
thing with the Passion Test.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It's all over the world now,
with how many facilitators?

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Almost 1,500 now.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Teaching it
all over the world.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- how did the
Passion Test come to you?

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.587 align:middle line:84%
How did you come upon
this incredible system

00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
for people discovering
their passions?

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Well, I was actually
sitting in a seminar,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and this woman, Debra
Poneman, started

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
talking about a survey that
had been given to the 100 most

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
successful people in
the United States.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the time I had
actually lied and called in

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.790 align:middle line:84%
to work sick to
be at that seminar

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:90%
because my life was at the low.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I was recruiting
disk drive engineers

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:90%
in Silicon Valley, California.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't making any money.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:90%
I was failing miserably.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I felt like my ego
was totally destroyed.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I found out about her
seminar, and I called in sick,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:84%
went to her seminar, sat
down in the front row,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and she started talking
about a survey that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:84%
had been given to these
100 most successful people.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.545 align:middle line:84%
And she said the one thing
that all of these people

00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
have in common-- the most
successful people in the United

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
States had-- was they were all
living what they considered

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.251 align:middle line:90%
to be their top five passions.

00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And when she said
that, I was like, oh my God.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's it.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:84%
She went on to talk
about, and now, dressing

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.625 align:middle line:90%
for success, right?

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, sitting there--
you know those moments when

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.109 align:middle line:84%
someone's talking and they say
something, and it's like, bam!

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And I am like,
OK, that's it, that's it.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
If I could figure out what my
100-- what my top five passions

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
are, I'd be like all those
100 most successful people.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.805 align:middle line:84%
And that was the birth, in
that moment, many years back

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of what is now
known as the number

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
one tool all over the
world, the Passion Test.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, and I mean, I
know many of the facilitators,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:90%
and they love what they do.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are
living their passions

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:84%
at the same time as teaching
other people, of course, which

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:90%
is the way it's supposed to be.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Well,
you know, why it's

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:84%
so much fun for
my facilitators--

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and I call them mine.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%
They're not my coauthor Chris
Attwood's, they're mine.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's because it's a tool
that's for everyone, absolutely

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:90%
across the board.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
people always-- when

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
you get more clear
on what is it you

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
care about in all the different
areas of your life, which

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
the Passion Test
helps people to do,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:84%
then you're always going to find
you're upgrading, upgrading.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and since it's
all-- since the whole process

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and the whole program
that my facilitators teach

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.764 align:middle line:84%
is all about everyone
else, in other words,

00:03:25.764 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:90%
they give instruction.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:84%
They say, here's how to
do it, here's what you do.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Then everyone gets to jump
in and involve themself,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:90%
and that makes it a ton of fun.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all
about you, right?

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.836 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's all about them.

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about what it is.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:90%
What is the Passion Test?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to kind of
go through this a little bit

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.215 align:middle line:84%
here on the show, too, so
people can experience it.

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: I love that.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.275 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: OK, so it's one
exercise after the other,

00:03:46.275 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
after the other to
gain a level of clarity

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:90%
that you've never before had.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, what we
say in the Passion Test,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.206 align:middle line:84%
we have this beautiful
quote-- "When you are clear,

00:03:57.206 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
what you choose to have
show up in your life, will.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And only to the extent
that you're clear.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:90%
That clarity is power."

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have the first step
is this process where

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
we help people to come up with--
through an actual illumination

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.201 align:middle line:84%
process-- to their top five
passions, just like I did,

00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
thing that, when I went,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, I got
to figure out that.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.829 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first step,
getting them clear--

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.662 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What were your
top five at the time?

00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:21.904 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: At the time?

00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
God, let's see, at the
time it was probably like,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
having a great
lover, boyfriend, I'm

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
sure, because that's where
I was at at the time.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it was a New
York Times bestselling author,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
because I just wanted
to be a New York Times

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:84%
author, a
transformational leader.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:90%
It had to have fun in it.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Now this is a long time ago.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm absolutely
sure it had hanging out

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:84%
with great friends who
love me that I love.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Because those are
the things that matter to me.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And those are probably
the things that you manifested.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.646 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, I manifested
those things, but,

00:04:54.646 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, what I
found as I started

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
manifesting certain ones was
that I had to take the Passion

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Test again and, you know,
that after about three

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
to six months, I
realized I don't know,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
how come I'm not choosing
in favor of that?

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
what happens, huh?

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.897 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah.

00:05:11.897 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, OK, I
have to take this again.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I have to get clear again.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what's so great
about the Passion Test,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and we tell people to take
it every three to six months,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
is that you keep getting
clearer and clearer and clearer

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
until you're really
locked, you're

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:84%
at a lock with
what it is that you

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:90%
love and are passionate about.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And then after a
while of course,

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
when you start
fulfilling those things,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:90%
you want to look at it again.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.554 align:middle line:90%
And OK, upgrade time.

00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It shows that
it really works, though.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you write
down your top 5

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
passions and then
what do you do?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Well actually, you
don't write down your top five.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:84%
What we tell people
first to do is

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
you take-- maybe you write down
a list of 10, 15, 20 passions.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
elimination process

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
that we walk people
through to have

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
them come up with
their top five.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
we say top five

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is because we've been working
with these neuroscientists

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
from the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was
that-- and you know this

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.350 align:middle line:84%
without the research,
but what they found

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
was that the mind can only
contain five to seven pieces

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.339 align:middle line:90%
of information at any time.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At a time, I see.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, so that's
why hence the five.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.152 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I always
say to everybody

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
when I'm talking
to them, you guys,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:90%
you know what overload is like.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.292 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know what
overload is like, don't you?

00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: OK, let's see,
do you have a cellphone?

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Do you have an iPad?

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.061 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Do you have a Mac?

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: PC.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: OK, and
in your car do you

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.207 align:middle line:90%
have your whole set up right?

00:06:40.207 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Right.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
even your phone.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Remember those?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:90%
The phone?

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So I could be on all of my
technology all day long,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and I know everybody I
talk to is just going,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:84%
God, yeah, and like,
my brain is fried.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is, yeah.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Right?

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So what's so cool
about the Passion Test

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
is that when you
get clear on what

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
it is that you're
passionate about

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and you come up
with your top five,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:84%
then you can consistently
choose in favor of those things

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of, like,
eliminates the stuff

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.410 align:middle line:90%
that you know is just clutter.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Immediately.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Is that in the
direction my passion?

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.629 align:middle line:90%
Is that?

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.629 align:middle line:90%
Is that?

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.947 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what-- why
is passion so important,

00:07:18.947 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and what do you mean by passion?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.405 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because I have
passion for a lot of things,

00:07:22.405 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and I definitely tend
to get very diffused.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And ADD sets in, and then I
go 15 different directions,

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:90%
and I get so unfocused.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
How do I know which
are my passions?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:90%
I think they all are.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Well, yeah.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might
think they all are.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
stopped and got clear,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
if you really stopped and
started looking at the things

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.950 align:middle line:84%
that you were saying
yes to, what you'd find

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:84%
is that, gosh, I'm
saying yes to things

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:90%
that have lesser meaning for me.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.109 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing that--
now and I'm not

00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:90%
going to say you do that, Lisa.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:84%
God, I'm sure you're an expert
in living a passionate life,

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.488 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:57.488 --> 00:07:58.112 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ha, ha.

00:07:58.112 --> 00:07:59.535 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Not you, Not you.

00:07:59.535 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, no.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Oh, but lookit,
I'm still growing in this.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm still growing in
this myself, you know.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like I have
to say, OK, what

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
am I more passionate
about, this or this?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of
people, they think

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
they're all that important,
but when you really

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
start to hone them down--
in the elimination process,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:90%
we have three questions.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And we say-- let's say,
for instance-- well,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
we'll pretend your two passions
are being present in the moment

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and then your other passion
would be spending time

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.600 align:middle line:90%
with your family, OK?

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And so I would
say-- the first question

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I would ask is, Lisa,
what's more important?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Being present in the moment or
spending time with your family?

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.712 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would say being
present in the moment while

00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:90%
spending time with my family.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: OK, but here's
the thing-- if you said,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
God, being present in the
moment is really important.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Spending time with my
family is really important.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:90%
So I don't really know.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Then I would say, OK, let's
go to question number two.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.799 align:middle line:84%
And question number
two, so this helps

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:84%
a person who thinks that
everything they're doing

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:90%
is as important.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.547 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, which
is me, totally.

00:09:12.547 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.915 align:middle line:84%
So I would say to yourself, so
Lisa, if you could be present

00:09:16.915 --> 00:09:19.585 align:middle line:84%
in the moment but never
spend time with your family--

00:09:19.585 --> 00:09:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, no.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.501 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: -- or if you could
spend time with your family

00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:84%
but never be present in the
moment, which matters most?

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would
have to say family.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: OK.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.114 align:middle line:90%
And for some people, they go--

00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: If I have to choose.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: God, being
present in the moment

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and sitting down with
my family and sometimes

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:90%
they still don't know.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.804 align:middle line:84%
So then we take them
to another level.

00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's three
questions that we

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:84%
ask in the Passion Test
of the very first part

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
of the elimination proc--
of this elimination process.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So the third question would
be, so Lisa, close your eyes.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.597 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you're being
present in the moment.

00:09:55.597 --> 00:09:57.305 align:middle line:84%
See yourself being
present in the moment.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:57.804 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:57.804 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: That you're
present at a 10.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.506 align:middle line:90%
There's no room for improvement.

00:10:01.506 --> 00:10:02.755 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I think I can do that.

00:10:02.755 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Are you there?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.601 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: OK, but notice
that nowhere in that picture

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
are you spending time
with your family.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that
doesn't make any sense.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Now, and then I would
say set that picture aside.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine that you're
spending that great time

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:90%
with your family.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
But-- and you're doing that at
a 10, no room for improvement.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But nowhere in that
picture are you

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:90%
being present in the moment.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's-- that
doesn't work, either.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Which feels better?

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.719 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Again, I
go back to, well,

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
it feels better to
be with my family.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: There you
go, end of story.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it does.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: That's it.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:41.753 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:10:41.753 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: So with every,
yeah, with the Passion Test,

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:84%
what we do is we go through this
whole process, through 1 to 10,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.429 align:middle line:84%
or 15 passions, or 20 passions
to come up with the top 5.

00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:55.053 align:middle line:84%
And for people at
first, they struggle.

00:10:55.053 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Oftentimes,
people struggle at first,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.759 align:middle line:90%
like they were like you.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, God, I don't know.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But the more they take
it, the clearer they get.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
The clearer they
get, the more they

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
hone in on what it is
they care most about.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And let me ask
you this question.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
If you were living your top
five passions full out, right?

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
You were just like, yes,
like, life is so juicy.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
How would-- I mean, would
you need anything else?

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.339 align:middle line:90%
How cool what would that be?

00:11:23.339 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sleep, I
would probably need.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But that could be
one of my passions.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.904 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: That might be
one of your passions.

00:11:27.904 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Which is that I spend
quality time with myself,

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.191 align:middle line:90%
with self care, right?

>>LISA: Yes.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:34.231 align:middle line:90%
That I take--

00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that I listen to my
body when it needs rest.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:90%
That would be a big one.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: So that's
the first-- I said

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.370 align:middle line:84%
there's all these
different exercises.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.080 align:middle line:90%
So there's elimination.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Then we go and we
score your passions.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:84%
We actually take a
look at, all right,

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:90%
where are you living right now?

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
your top five passions.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Where are you right now, in
reality, on a scale of 0 to 10,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
where would you say
you are right now?

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.607 align:middle line:84%
And we'd look at each
one of your five,

00:12:01.607 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and you'd score them, and
it takes about a minute.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, present in
the moment, nope, suck.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:90%
All right, I'm about a two.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:84%
All right, spending time with
my family, eh, seven, right?

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And what is so cool about
scoring one's passion,

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and everybody always
has these huge a-has,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is that you can actually
identify whether people

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.217 align:middle line:84%
are happy or not just by
looking at their scores.

00:12:26.217 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Because think
about it-- your passions,

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.470 align:middle line:90%
what's more intimate to you?

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
What do you care more
about than your passion?

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.994 align:middle line:84%
What you love, the
things that get you out

00:12:37.994 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:90%
of bed in the morning.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: So I can immediately
look at someone's passions,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.622 align:middle line:84%
if they're like zero,
two, four, three--

00:12:44.622 --> 00:12:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you'll see.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And I can go,
OK, here's the good news.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.213 align:middle line:90%
That's all good news.

00:12:50.213 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Because it is, right?

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Here's the good news.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.924 align:middle line:84%
And then I share with them
how you move these scores up.

00:12:56.924 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the whole
training of the Passion Test.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The whole idea.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: But isn't that cool?

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.731 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take a
look at this video

00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
here of how to
find your passion.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.722 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:13:05.722 --> 00:13:09.096 align:middle line:90%

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And in the Vedas, it
says curving back on myself.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Curving.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Curving back on myself, I create
again and again and again.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.176 align:middle line:84%
And what the Passion Test is,
is one exercise after the other

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to take today--

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
we'll see how many I
can get through today--

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
so that you get this
picture so completely

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.640 align:middle line:84%
clear within yourself
that you become

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%
what we call a
passionate magnet.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
A passionate magnet where
the people and the places

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:90%
and the things start to show up.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, why this is important is
because your passions are not

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:90%
personal.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this interesting?

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
How many of you think
we exist in isolation?

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know that you're
part and parcel of what science

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
has been talking about for
now for a long time called

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:90%
the unified field?

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
That you are part and parcel of
this incredible unified field

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that each and every one
of us affect one another.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:90%
How many of you know that?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.090 align:middle line:90%
You affect everyone.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Your passionate
life is about being

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:90%
the teacher living the teaching.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Being the teacher
living the teaching.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
It's about living
in your integrity.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
It's about really
being true to you.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you're true to you,
moms and dads, what are you

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
reflecting back
to those children?

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you're repressing
what your passions are,

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, and you have this
big cross on your back,

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:84%
oh, I have to be there for
everybody else, you know?

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Notice how angry you are, or
notice how resentful you are.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Notice how your
relationships are

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
being affected, even
with your children.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.345 align:middle line:90%
Notice.

00:14:58.345 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:90%
It's about being conscious.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Just don't take my word for it.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Notice.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Start noticing what happens when
you say yes and you mean no.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Notice.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.532 align:middle line:90%
Is it working for you?

00:15:11.532 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Does it work for anyone else?

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
My experience is, every
time I stay true to me

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and drop in and really say, you
know, what's more important,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.594 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:15:23.594 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I choose in favor
of the things that

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.884 align:middle line:84%
have greatest meaning
for me, somehow--

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know why
it is-- everybody wins.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And when I say yes and I
mean no, everybody loses.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
My company is called
Enlightened Alliances.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Enlightened Alliances.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%

together to give maximum,

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:90%
both receive maximum.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.846 align:middle line:84%
How can you give to anyone if
you don't know what they need?

00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Want to know how
to find out what

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
they need in a
matter of minutes?

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Take the Passion Test.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Give them the Passion Test.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Find out what they care about.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Moms and dads, what would your
relationship with your kids

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.612 align:middle line:84%
be like if you said,
honey, I'm going

00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:90%
to give you the Passion Test.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you find out what
their passions are and say,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
sweetheart, I am going to
do everything in my power

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
as you are growing
to make sure you

get to live your
passions full out.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to support
you in any way I can.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
about my passions,

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.388 align:middle line:84%
too, so you'll know why
I'm so weird, sweetheart.

because I believe,

and I know you do,
too, that each of us

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%

in tune with what it
is that I care about

is all about how I affect
and treat everyone else.

Because if I wake up in

00:17:37.115 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
sucks and I hate what I'm
doing and I can hardly get out

comes up to me and says,

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.457 align:middle line:84%
hey, mom, and I'm feeling
awful, that little person

00:17:46.457 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:84%
is going to get that,
and that little person

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:84%
is going to go to
school, and they're

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:84%

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:90%
to what it is our gifts are.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
beautiful about that is

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.217 align:middle line:84%
there's no competition
when you're being you.

00:18:33.217 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter,
no, because you're

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:90%
in that place of so much bliss.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it surprised
me when I looked

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:84%
at this next video how many
people are truly not living

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.837 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:18:44.837 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this video.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.075 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Alarming, huh?

00:18:47.075 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.063 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah.

00:18:48.063 --> 00:18:50.108 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:50.108 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:84%
There's this Harris
Poll survey that

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
found that four out of
five working Americans--

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:90%
and I travel all over the world.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:84%
In a month-- no, sorry,
in two and a half weeks,

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll be in Japan.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
After that, in August, Marci
Shimoff and I go to China.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:90%
If any of you know who Marci is.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Then after that
I go to Tel Aviv,

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:90%
then after that I go to Bali.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have traveled all over
the world for the last number

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of years, and I see that all
over the world, the statistics,

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
some, and especially in third
world countries, the statistics

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:90%
are even worse, right?

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what
that means to the world

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that four out of
five people wake up

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
not happy, not fulfilled,
and not passionate?

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it any surprise that we
read what we read and we

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.840 align:middle line:84%
see what we see and we
turn on the television?

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.657 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to go on a
bummer, it's so easy, isn't it?

00:19:39.657 --> 00:19:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You just turn on TV and you just
sit there and watch the news.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you sit
there long enough,

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
you really get to go
into all of your misery.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So what's so great about this
is that you guys are going

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.604 align:middle line:84%
to be these conscious creators
even more than you already are.

00:19:57.604 --> 00:19:59.645 align:middle line:84%
But I got to tell you,
the fact that you stopped,

00:19:59.645 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
you stepped out
of your busy life,

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.807 align:middle line:90%
you walked into this room.

00:20:02.807 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody
said they had more

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:84%
going on than they
needed-- and you're here.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean about you?

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what it means.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It means that you're one of
those eighty-percenters-- one

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
of those, excuse me,
twenty-percenters.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
You're a twenty-percenter, which
means that you are conscious.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.097 align:middle line:90%
You are conscious.

00:20:20.097 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to
even get more conscious.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.471 align:middle line:84%
You know, as you
have more knowledge,

00:20:23.471 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:90%
you just expand, expand, expand.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:90%
What do most people do?

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The eighty-percenters, they
wake up in the morning,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and you know them, they turn on
their TV, they watch the news,

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:84%
they get in their car,
they turn on the radio,

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:84%
they listen to the
news, they get to work,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.254 align:middle line:84%
they talk to everybody
about the news.

00:20:40.254 --> 00:20:41.206 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Is the
Passion Test something

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:90%
that you can take online, right?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a free assessment
online at thepassiontest.com?

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Exactly right.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.059 align:middle line:84%
You can take the
Passion Test online,

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:84%
you can get a facilitator to
give you the Passion Test,

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:84%
you can come find me
somewhere in the world--

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
'cause I'm always, like, out
there on some big old stage.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You can order the Passion
Test book on Amazon,

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, walk into
your local bookstore

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:90%
and say, get 100 copies.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Everyone should have it.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:90%
And take the Passion Test.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I always
recommend to people--

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:84%
take the Passion Test
with someone else.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say that
is because, oftentimes, we

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
aren't really present
with ourselves

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:84%
or honest with
ourselves, and when

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
you're having to look in someone
else's eyes, and they say,

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:90%
what's more important?

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:90%
This or this?

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It makes you more
accountable, and so I really

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:84%
recommend that people make
sure that they take it

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:90%
with someone else.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Also, I always say
to married couples,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.977 align:middle line:84%
or couples, don't take
it with each other.

00:21:49.977 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.177 align:middle line:90%
OK, why, right?

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Could we do it real quick?

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:90%
So here's an example.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.314 align:middle line:84%
So my top five passions
that I think-- I'm

00:21:57.314 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
going to do kind of
an abridged version.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Oh, I'm going to
have to remember these, right?

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Give me two of them.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.976 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, two
of them, I mean,

00:22:04.976 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I know that my number
one passion is fun.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I notice this because I
type it a lot in my texts.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly
writing the word, fun.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I started noticing, I
really highly value fun.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:90%
I love fun.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:90%
And this is fun for me.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Playing with my family is fun.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Going on a mountain
bike ride is fun.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.169 align:middle line:84%
So I would say fun is kind
of my number one passion.

00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Your number one?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It kind of--

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.687 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: It's my number two.

00:22:31.687 --> 00:22:32.895 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's your number two?

00:22:32.895 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Having fun
with everything I do.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:90%
It is my number two passion.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it really?

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: I have to have
fun with everything I do.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you travel with
me and my friends, like,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I have someone who has
been an assistant who's

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:90%
been traveling with me.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
She always says to everyone,
she has to have so much fun.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.572 align:middle line:84%
Because-- I don't know,
life seems too, you know,

00:22:52.572 --> 00:22:54.030 align:middle line:84%
too short if you're
not having fun.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It motivates me.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Well, living a
passionate life, though,

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:90%
and this is an automatic, right?

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it
in your own life.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:84%
When you're really living
the things that you love,

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.781 align:middle line:90%
that's joyful, that's fun.

00:23:05.781 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.277 align:middle line:90%
It gives me energy.

00:23:08.277 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: I have a good
friend named Deborah.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And Deborah's fun is
working all the time.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.826 align:middle line:90%
But it is her fun.

00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's her fun.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: She loves it.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It's her juice, and she's
always in a good mood.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.514 align:middle line:84%
So some people's fun
is also very different.

00:23:19.514 --> 00:23:20.430 align:middle line:90%
What's your other one?

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to know.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, gosh, I must
say it's family, it is.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Now, is
that number two?

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well fun and family.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I like having fun
with my family.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, OK, so if you
would write your passion,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:84%
it would be, when
my life is ideal,

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm always having lots of
fun with my family, right?

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.649 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: OK, so it's
two different things,

00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:84%
but then you didn't mention
fun with my work, fun

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.407 align:middle line:90%
with my this, fun with my that.

00:23:48.407 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Here's what we see
in the Passion Test

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
when you write your passions.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
When you are clear,
what you choose

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:84%
to have show up in your life
will, and only to the extent

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:90%
that you're clear.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So we tell people
make sure-- that's

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:84%
why I say take the
Passion Test three, four

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:90%
times in the very beginning.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Because what you'll find is
that they start-- they shift

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and they morph, and then after
a while though, it's like zoom.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And you really get it.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:90%
You're like a samurai.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's a saying we
have in the Passion Test:

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle line:90%
action engages attention.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a really
interesting one.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Action engages attention.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
What most people think,
and I was brought up,

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and you probably
were, too, my dad

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.231 align:middle line:84%
would say it takes hard
work to get the job done.

00:24:31.231 --> 00:24:32.856 align:middle line:84%
It takes hard work
to get the job done,

00:24:32.856 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and I started really
thinking about that.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it hard worth it
gets the job done only?

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought no,
it's consciousness.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Conscious awareness.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you're engaged in
something you love and you're

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
100% present with that
thing that you totally love,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.072 align:middle line:90%
it's like a lock, isn't it?

00:24:52.072 --> 00:24:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what you
mean by consciousness?

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:54.613 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah.

00:24:54.613 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness,
your attention,

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.619 align:middle line:84%
is a locked onto that thing
that you're passionate about.

00:24:59.619 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that what happens to you?

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: OK, and so
what consciousness

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:84%
does is it moves those--
it moves that energy,

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.890 align:middle line:84%
it moves that passion
to find fulfillment.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And it is so interesting,
you know, because all of you

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.060 align:middle line:84%
is focused on what it is
that you choose to manifest.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness is actually
what I say gets the job done.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Another word
I love is connection.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah, connect--

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Conscious connection.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And you think
about it, when you're not

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.492 align:middle line:84%
passionate about what you're
up to-- Have you ever been

00:25:32.492 --> 00:25:32.991 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of like
lukewarm, wishy-washy.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:84%
What's the outcome of
whatever you're up to?

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mud.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.865 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Wishy-washy.

00:25:42.865 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.437 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not,
like, really fulfilling.

00:25:46.437 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: This is why it's
really important for all of us

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, take time,
step out of our busy life,

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and ask ourself, when
my life is ideal--

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that's what we start with in
the Passion Test, the very

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
first step, get a
piece of paper out--

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.766 align:middle line:84%
when my life is
ideal, I am-- and then

00:26:03.766 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
think of the areas of your
life that are important:

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:84%
your health, your career,
your spirituality, your fun,

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.102 align:middle line:84%
your education, your
environment, where do you live.

00:26:12.102 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We have a slide here
that shows all of those,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.450 align:middle line:84%
so we said we have to think
about our-- these areas

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:90%
in our life that are important.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Fun, service, education,
spirituality, environment,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
career, relationship,
and health.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
considering your top five,

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.654 align:middle line:84%
go after those type--
those categories, right?

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah, uh-huh.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Go after those categories,
look at them all,

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
be really sure when you're
writing your passions down--

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:84%
here is what always
happens to people--

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
they write about
three, four, five times

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:84%
on something they
really care about

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.090 align:middle line:90%
in all these different ways.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
the same passion.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So look at these different
areas and then at least

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:84%
choose at least one area
to write about, and then

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:90%
go from there.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And that way you'll
have the full range.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Because in the Passion Test,
what we're trying to do

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:84%
is to create this
balance in life.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you do when you are

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:84%
you looking at all
these different areas.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Many times when
people are really

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
focused their-- focus
on their career--

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and we've all heard of people
that have jumped out a window,

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
they had a great career,
they had all the money,

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't have
the relationships.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:90%
They weren't connected to self.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we say look
at all the different areas.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Robin Williams as an
example, and we don't know--

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Bummer, huh?

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: -- his
situation specifically,

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.870 align:middle line:84%
but from the outside it
appeared that he had everything.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And from the inside
he was hurting

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and didn't maybe have
that close person,

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that close connection
that could reflect back

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to him what he was
passionate about.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I find myself going
through, you know,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I've done values
classes and all of that.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:90%
And they do change.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And about the time-- right now
is about the time in my life

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:84%
when I'd love to take
this again because I think

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going a little
bit too fast and I

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
need to slow down
and remind myself

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
what my passions are so I
really say yes to the things

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aligned with
rather than saying yes

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:90%
for the sake of saying yes.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, and if I had
been able to sit with Robin

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Williams, right, he would have
been able to see when he was

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.569 align:middle line:84%
scoring his passions,
right, that--

00:28:12.569 --> 00:28:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He was off.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: -- that probably
spending time with his family,

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
or something-- something
there, or, you know,

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:84%
quality time with my own self
care was like, whoa zero.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, I need to put my
attention on that thing.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
What you put your attention
on grows stronger.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you
raise the bar--

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:84%
how you raise the bar is
you start choosing in favor

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
of the thing that you're
most passionate about.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.407 align:middle line:84%
And that's what most
people don't do, right?

00:28:39.407 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, absolutely.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: What most
people don't do is go,

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, I care about this, I'm
choosing in favor of this.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:84%
What most people
do is, God, they

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.120 align:middle line:84%
want me to do that so,
God, I probably should,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.735 align:middle line:84%
because I really
want them to love me.

00:28:52.735 --> 00:28:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The shoulds.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:53.325 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:28:53.325 --> 00:28:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, they're
should-ing all over them.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, they're should-ing.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've gotten
there too, but OK,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
so here's a slide her
somebody's top five passions,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
so this is an example of when
you write on the top, when

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:90%
my life is ideal, I am.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And then there's six
here, sorry about that,

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.690 align:middle line:90%
and there's being of service.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.724 align:middle line:84%
You can see being a
great partner or wife.

00:29:13.724 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Vibrant health, there's
health in there.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Being in the present moment.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Writing a best
seller-- lot of people

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.170 align:middle line:84%
have that as a
goal-- as a passion.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And then education
there as well.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.354 align:middle line:84%
And so is there a specific
way to write these?

00:29:26.354 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Do you write them
in the positive?

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.447 align:middle line:84%
Like I notice these
here, you know.

00:29:29.447 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all heard our
word is our wand, right?

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Our word is our wand?

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: "Your
Word is Your Wand."

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I read this book by
Florence Scovel Shinn.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I think that's how
you pronounce it.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, what happens when
you put, when my life is ideal,

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm out of this job that
totally sucks, I hate it.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
the energy goes.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So with the word
suck, with hate.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make sure that
you take those words that

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.120 align:middle line:84%
really thrill you, that
just speak to your soul

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:84%
because what we
tell people to do,

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
after you figure out through
this process of elimination,

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
what your top five passions are,
then write them down on a 3 x 5

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.710 align:middle line:84%
card and innocently--
and that's the word--

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
not straining or
forcing, but innocently

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:19.890 align:middle line:84%
putting your attention on
your top five passions.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, if you're having
words in there that you have

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
a big charge on, like
hate or whatever,

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
then it's not going to
speak to you energetically.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So you want to use words
like fantastic and exuberant

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and brilliant and beautiful
and audacious and outrageously

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.900 align:middle line:90%
great, right, that speak to you.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So that when you read it,
you're like yes, yes, yes.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So there's a
slide here that talks

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.204 align:middle line:90%
about how to actually write it.

00:30:44.204 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:84%
To write it in the positive,
you could take a look at that

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And basically say
you are happily

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.900 align:middle line:84%
working in your ideal career,
I'm in my ideal relationship

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.517 align:middle line:90%
and having fun.

00:30:56.517 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, well,
we tell people write it

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.720 align:middle line:84%
as if it's already
happened, right?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Write it as if you're right
there, right now because it's

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.100 align:middle line:90%
only a thought.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Most people go, god,
I can't do that.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I said, well it's
only a thought.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:90%
It's only a thought.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you put on
your Mickey Mouse ears

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.490 align:middle line:84%
like a little kid would
and have fun with it.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Have that innocent attitude
like a childlike mind.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
A child wouldn't go,
I can't have that.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm too old.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.034 align:middle line:84%
I'm too this, I'm
too that, right.

00:31:25.034 --> 00:31:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But this is what we
do as adults, right,

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.324 align:middle line:90%
we start to censor ourself.

00:31:28.324 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What if you want
something intangible,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.870 align:middle line:90%
like energy?

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, so
when my life is ideal,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm filled with energy
in every moment.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
third-- we haven't even

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.930 align:middle line:84%
talked about this-- a third
level, right, remember when

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I said it's one exercise after
another to help you clarify

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:84%
from within yourself so that
you have a clear picture of it.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have people make
what we call markers.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Markers are guideposts
or signposts.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.060 align:middle line:84%
They're evidence
that your passion

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:90%
is being lived full out.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: So for
instance, say that you

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:84%
write down, when
my life is ideal,

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I am filled with massive
amounts of energy every day.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So a marker would
be that thing that

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
would show that you are
doing that without a doubt.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So massive energy,
a marker would

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
be people comment every single
day on how much energy they

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.300 align:middle line:90%
get from me.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:90%
That's a marker.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what we call a marker.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
A marker says that
that passion is

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.584 align:middle line:84%
being lived full
out, no improvement.

00:32:31.584 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.795 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's reflected
back to you in some way?

00:32:33.795 --> 00:32:34.503 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Exactly.

00:32:34.503 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
kind of like-- you

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.106 align:middle line:84%
have to step back, you have
to look at that passion,

00:32:38.106 --> 00:32:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and you say, OK, if I'm really
living that passion full out,

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
what would have to happen--
what would happen to me?

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, I wake up every
morning ready to go.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like, I
never want to sleep.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.780 align:middle line:84%
All of these would be
a marker for having

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.890 align:middle line:84%
massive amounts
of energy, right?

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.642 align:middle line:84%
I love getting everything
done, and I still

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:90%
have the room for more.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I feel good,
yes, and I still have energy.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So that is less tangible than
something like finances, where

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:84%
you could see a number or have a
certain result of the finances.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:10.265 align:middle line:84%
But you get reflected
back to you, wow,

00:33:10.265 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:90%
you have a lot of energy.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Or you are more resilient
in stressful situations

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:90%
because you have more energy.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.634 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Well, the reason
that we have people

00:33:18.634 --> 00:33:20.930 align:middle line:84%
make markers is because
there's this beautiful saying,

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:84%
it's in the Vedas,
curving back on myself.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The Vedas, by the way,
are the most ancient form

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.160 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual literature
known to man,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and there's this saying,
"Curving back on myself,

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I create again and again."

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.290 align:middle line:84%
It means that it's
an inside out job.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Inside out job.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So the reason for the Passion
Test, writing your passions,

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.790 align:middle line:84%
writing them in a way that
you really resonate with them,

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:84%
scoring your passions,
markers-- all

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:84%
of these different
exercises are so

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that you'll have a clear
picture from within yourself.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the clearer
that picture is

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.210 align:middle line:84%
of your beautiful,
fabulous, ideal life,

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.490 align:middle line:84%
you start to magnify those
people, places, and things

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.700 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole formula
for this in the Passion Test--

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.116 align:middle line:84%
intention, attention,
no tension.

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:13.949 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We actually
have a video about that.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I want to show that.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.900 align:middle line:90%
You do a great job of this.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.043 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: All right, great.

00:34:18.043 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:26.739 align:middle line:84%
So intention, attention, first
two steps to a passionate life.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:90%
And then no tension.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.719 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most
important part of the formula.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:84%
And this is where everybody, you
know, I would say this is where

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:84%
about 80% of the
people kind of space.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.969 align:middle line:90%
They don't get this part.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:39.880 align:middle line:90%
No tension.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.959 align:middle line:84%
So you know your passions, you
put your attention on them,

00:34:42.959 --> 00:34:45.500 align:middle line:84%
you take action, you strike like
lightning in all directions.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.159 align:middle line:84%
You do everything
you know to do.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have done that
with something you want to do?

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.468 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the
most important part.

00:34:51.468 --> 00:34:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Really, the most important part.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
where the magic is.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.820 align:middle line:90%
The no tension is you surrender.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.480 align:middle line:90%
You let go.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:84%
You say, this or
something better.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean once you've done all
you can do, for God's sakes,

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.700 align:middle line:90%
what can you do?

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
If you keep doing, it's like
you're straining on the mantra,

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what I say.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.862 align:middle line:90%
Or you're stepping on the hose.

00:35:12.862 --> 00:35:14.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, a hose that's
fill-- you know, that's

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.970 align:middle line:84%
you turned on full blast
but you step on it,

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:middle line:90%
you know what happens, right?

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:90%
It can't flow.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So intention, attention--
the no tension part

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:84%
is saying this or
something better.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And finally, OK, I've
done as much as I can do,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and then it's time
for me to let go.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And what's so beautiful now--
my left brain guys and women,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, because
I'm not a scientist,

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.750 align:middle line:84%
but I get emails
every day-- really,

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.330 align:middle line:84%
sincerely, every day from all
over the world-- from someone

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:52.690 align:middle line:84%
or lots of people that say this
changed my life financially.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:90%
This changed my life, my health.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:84%
This changed my life,
my relationships.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.400 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
you surrender is

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.550 align:middle line:84%
you create what physics
calls a vacuum state where

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the people, and the places,
and things start to show up.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you're
straining and it's so tight,

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.314 align:middle line:90%
no energy can go through.

00:36:15.314 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed that?

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can come in.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So how can you notice the
gifts that's always there

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:25.176 align:middle line:90%
if you're so completely tight?

00:36:25.176 --> 00:36:26.655 align:middle line:90%
So this is the formula.

00:36:26.655 --> 00:36:27.641 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:27.641 --> 00:36:31.585 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:31.585 --> 00:36:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you say
your intention,

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and then you go
to the attention.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But what happens-- what's the
difference here between goals

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:42.251 align:middle line:90%
and passion?

00:36:42.251 --> 00:36:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Are they the same thing?

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Oh my God,
I love that question.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.636 align:middle line:84%
I'm so-- thank you,
thank you, thank you

00:36:46.636 --> 00:36:48.984 align:middle line:84%
for asking me that
question because, well,

00:36:48.984 --> 00:36:50.650 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
goal and passion,

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:53.490 align:middle line:84%
your passions are what you
love, what you care about.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So say your passion is to
be a Olympic skier, right?

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to be Olympic skier.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, what would your goal be?

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:06.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're a Olympic skier,
I think it would be,

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.452 align:middle line:84%
you know, for me, if I wanted
to be an Olympic skier,

00:37:08.452 --> 00:37:10.160 align:middle line:84%
let's see, I'd be
about 20 years younger.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.456 align:middle line:84%
But aside from
that, I would, you

00:37:13.456 --> 00:37:15.775 align:middle line:84%
know, OK, I'm going
to exercise, and--

00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, train, yeah.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, I'm going to
train my little brains out,

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:19.990 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Six days a week,
eight hours a day.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:84%
In the Passion Test,
remember, I shared with you

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:90%
that we have markers.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So that-- oftentimes, what
people ask us is, well,

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.210 align:middle line:84%
what's the difference
between goals and markers?

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So your-- you've
got your passion.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to be, when my life
is ideal I'm an Olympic gold

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.100 align:middle line:90%
medalist.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Your goal.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to work
my brains out six days

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:84%
a week training my
little tushy off.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And then a marker would
be, I'm at the podium

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.087 align:middle line:90%
receiving the gold medal.

00:37:52.087 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: See, the
marker, again, it

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.935 align:middle line:90%
shows you that you are there.

00:37:56.935 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:90%
You are there.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And why this is so
important, Lisa,

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.590 align:middle line:84%
it's so important because you
can, again, when you can really

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:06.270 align:middle line:84%
see it all the way to
the end, and that's

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:84%
what markers help a person
do-- they help them really

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:84%
see-- walk that passion
all the way to the end.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Then, because it's
an inside out job,

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:84%
you start attracting the
people, places, and things

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.240 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And you also know what to
go for at the same time.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So it gives you
just massive clarity

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.097 align:middle line:84%
to create that
thing in your life.

00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It helps you not
get off track, which is--

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: It totally-- it
totally helps you get off track.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you,
I'm the passion queen.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:90%
I am known as Le Passion Queen.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can write like, zip, zip,
zip, zip, a hundred passions.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.232 align:middle line:84%
But when I have to
stop and go, let's see,

00:38:44.232 --> 00:38:46.231 align:middle line:84%
when my life is ideal,
I'm present in the moment

00:38:46.231 --> 00:38:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and loving what is, which
is a top passion of mine--

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's your big?

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: OK, I have to think,
OK, I'm present in the moment,

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.780 align:middle line:90%
and I'm loving what is.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.280 align:middle line:90%
What would have to happen?

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.101 align:middle line:90%
And then, OK.

00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:90%
People say, geeze, Janet.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're so present.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:02.861 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: This has--

00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:05.148 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're so
present with me.

00:39:05.148 --> 00:39:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: You are so, like, here.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.700 align:middle line:84%
When you're here,
you are so here.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You are.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And I love how, Janet,
you just flow with everything,

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:14.900 align:middle line:90%
got it?

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:15.525 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do.

00:39:15.525 --> 00:39:16.462 align:middle line:90%
You absolutely do.

00:39:16.462 --> 00:39:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: So this
would be a marker.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.281 align:middle line:84%
People comment every
single day, wow.

00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:84%
You're in this moment with
me here, you're present,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.772 align:middle line:90%
you're flowing with what is.

00:39:25.772 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, and when you
can really, like, see it,

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to be
it, too, right?

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.962 align:middle line:84%
It's just so much easier,
so it's very, very cool.

00:39:32.962 --> 00:39:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Jack Canfield, you
know who he is, right?

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: He's
phenomenally successful,

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:84%
coauthor of the "Chicken
Soup for the Soul" series,

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.080 align:middle line:84%
"Guinness Book of
World Records."

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And I gave Jack
the Passion Test,

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and he actually said, after
taking the Passion Test,

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.890 align:middle line:84%
it changed the way
he lived his life.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And he also said it was markers.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.230 align:middle line:84%
He said Janet,
Janet those markers.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.500 align:middle line:84%
It was the markers that
separated the Passion Test

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:84%
from anything else out
there because it really

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.840 align:middle line:84%
gave a level of clarity
that wasn't there before.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I read
that, that he changed

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:84%
the way he related
with his family.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, he realized that
he wasn't spending as much time

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.670 align:middle line:84%
as he wanted to, and
he just went, zoop.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:84%
He's actually one of my
Passion Test facilitators.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, he is?

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:19.976 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Thank you,
Jack, I love you.

00:40:19.976 --> 00:40:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: He knows--

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, he
gives the Passion Test.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in India, I have people
come up to me, and they say,

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Jack Canfield gave
me the Passion Test.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:29.688 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're kidding.

00:40:29.688 --> 00:40:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Now you did recently
go to India?

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: I recently did, yeah.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you taught
the Passion Test to--

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.587 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: To 2,000 people.

00:40:36.587 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All at once?

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: All at once,
all these 2,000 Indians.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was so great,
it was such a blast.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.800 align:middle line:84%
It was an event put on
by Business Networking

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.060 align:middle line:90%
International.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It was the national
event in India.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was, like, such a raging
success they asked me to come

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.120 align:middle line:90%
back next year, and I'm--

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.195 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: I'm coming
back in March

00:40:58.195 --> 00:41:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to give a whole program for
women because they loved it.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean,
you can't not love it

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.780 align:middle line:84%
because number one-- remember,
my number two passion

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.730 align:middle line:84%
is having fun with
everything I do.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, everybody
there is having a blast.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.490 align:middle line:90%
But not only that.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.060 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're
walking out with something.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, how many times have
you gone to a conference,

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting there
and you're listening,

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.965 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening, and you're
listening, and you're excited,

00:41:23.965 --> 00:41:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited, but then
you walk out and you walk out.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But with the Passion
Test, they're like, OK,

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.470 align:middle line:84%
here's some information,
now write your passions.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Here's some information, let's
go and find your top five.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Here's some information, score.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Here's some information,
create your markers.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:45.755 align:middle line:84%
Here's some information, write
your hundredth birthday speech.

00:41:45.755 --> 00:41:46.296 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Cool.

00:41:46.296 --> 00:41:46.945 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:41:46.945 --> 00:41:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, your
hundredth birthday speech.

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So I tell everybody,
all right, once you've

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.060 align:middle line:84%
got all your passions, once
you know what your markers are,

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.720 align:middle line:84%
now write your hundredth
birthday speech

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.916 align:middle line:84%
as if someone that
you love is there

00:41:57.916 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:90%
at your hundredth birthday.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.440 align:middle line:84%
You're not dead-- good
news-- and they are just

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.470 align:middle line:84%
saying, you know, all
the wonderful things

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:90%
that you've done in your life.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:06.700 align:middle line:90%
And write it out.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like your script
for the next 100 years.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So again, and then
I say, you know,

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.520 align:middle line:84%
glorify all your passions and
your markers, just like whoa.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you put that
into, yeah, into the future,

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:17.580 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.955 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: That's
exactly it, yeah.

00:42:18.955 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But these-- this
whole idea of, first all,

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:84%
the people in India,
when they took this,

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.715 align:middle line:84%
they walked out probably
changing some way

00:42:27.715 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that they're living
their lives, right?

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Oh, massively.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, not just
them, I mean, Jack.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.020 align:middle line:90%
It's like people like Jack.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have
something tangible.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Here's a guy
at the top of his game,

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and he realizes, oh my God,
this is affecting my happiness.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
We have a friend, both of
us, Marci Shimoff, right,

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.850 align:middle line:84%
who we just love and adore,
who, New York Times bestselling

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:90%
author of "Happy for no Reason."

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:84%
When Marci was writing
"Happy for no Reason,"

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.280 align:middle line:84%
she went and interviewed the
happiest people she could find,

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and she calls them
her Happy 100.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And with her Happy
100, what she found

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.820 align:middle line:84%
was that they had two
things in common--

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.360 align:middle line:90%
this is what I remember.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Marc, I hope it's right.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.480 align:middle line:84%
One was that each
and every one of them

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:84%
had a way to tap
into self every day.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.284 align:middle line:84%
You know, mediation, some way
to have that direct contact.

00:43:14.284 --> 00:43:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Check back in.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: That direct
contact, right.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing
that they all had in common

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.300 align:middle line:84%
was they were all living
their passionate life.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.430 align:middle line:90%
So again, it's not personal.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.640 align:middle line:84%
It's important for
all of us to continue

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to clarify what are we
passionate about so that we can

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:36.220 align:middle line:84%
affect others in that really
wonderful, positive way.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
to do anything.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.510 align:middle line:90%
All we have to do is be.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I always call it,
this is the recipe

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.214 align:middle line:90%
of do less, accomplish more.

00:43:44.214 --> 00:43:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So have you
ever had anyone say,

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
I'm passionate about.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Oh, like
almost every day.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the survey finds
that four out of five

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.005 align:middle line:84%
working Americans
wake up every morning.

00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm constantly
meeting people like that.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I always intention,
OK, when I get on this plane,

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sit next to
the most beautiful person

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and say to them, so
what's your passion?

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I love to help
people, I mean, it's just fun,

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:84%
right, to just
doo, doo, doo, doo.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.660 align:middle line:90%
And this happens quite a lot.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of the times,
though, I mean, that I really

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.980 align:middle line:84%
found this to be so
was I was in Miami,

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:23.240 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking at an event
for 200 homeless women.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was so
excited, because one

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.980 align:middle line:84%
of the things that we say in the
Passion Test is your passions

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.920 align:middle line:84%
are like bread
crumbs that lead you

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.780 align:middle line:90%
onto the path of your destiny.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Your passions
aren't your destiny,

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
they're bread crumbs
that, as one door opens,

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.690 align:middle line:84%
another door closes,
and as you follow

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.827 align:middle line:84%
that, you find you're
there at one of your--

00:44:42.827 --> 00:44:43.910 align:middle line:90%
you know, at your purpose.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And it could be one of
your life purposes, that's

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.030 align:middle line:90%
what I found at this event.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm standing
there on this stage of 200

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:55.180 align:middle line:84%
homeless women, and I
think, my God my heart

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.980 align:middle line:90%
is going to fall out of my body.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, this is one of the
things I want to do in my life.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to work with
people that really

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.240 align:middle line:90%
feel like all hope is lost.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.716 align:middle line:84%
And so I look out at them, and
I'm giving the Passion Test,

00:45:07.716 --> 00:45:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually
going quite well.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I say OK, let's
write our passions.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And this one woman
just stands up

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.645 align:middle line:84%
and she goes, I-- and she's,
you know, tears in her eyes,

00:45:17.645 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm passionate about.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped for a minute and
I thought, I said, OK, so honey,

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I get this, you know, I just
felt like calling her honey.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I said, I've been there.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:32.400 align:middle line:90%
And I have been there, too.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so if you feel like
you have no idea what you're

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:84%
passionate about, and you
don't know what to write

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and you look at all this
and it's like really?

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.920 align:middle line:90%
How stupid.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Then think about
what you never want

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to have happen in
your life again.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, think of
something right now.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can
you find something

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.100 align:middle line:84%
you never want to
have happen again?

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.280 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is that?

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I never want
to live on the street.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, what
would be the best

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.160 align:middle line:84%
of the best, the 100%
opposite of that?

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said-- and it
was like a question

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.320 align:middle line:84%
for her-- I live in
a beautiful home?

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's right, honey.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.740 align:middle line:90%
You be you.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.320 align:middle line:84%
When you take the Passion
Test, don't compare yourself

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:84%
to others, don't
try to think you

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:29.800 align:middle line:84%
have to write this beautiful,
outrageously audacious life

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.100 align:middle line:90%
that's not yours.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.200 align:middle line:90%
But you be be.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.900 align:middle line:84%
You begin from where
you are right now.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So she wrote this
little thing down.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.800 align:middle line:84%
She got this biggest
smile on her.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aw, yeah.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: And it's real.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally real,
because the secret

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:48.639 align:middle line:84%
to living a passionate life
helps to redirect all of us.

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you think that
that would have redirected

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that woman to finding a
home because she had hope?

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Possibility?

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:56.760 align:middle line:90%
How is that--

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.343 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah.

00:46:57.343 --> 00:47:01.640 align:middle line:84%
What it does for anyone,
it puts their attention

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.170 align:middle line:84%
on what they choose
to create instead

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:06.789 align:middle line:84%
of what they don't
want to create--

00:47:06.789 --> 00:47:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is looping,
which is most likely looping.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: So what
is looping, right?

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:11.470 align:middle line:90%
What is that neural pathway?

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:12.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't want
to be on the street,

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.255 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be on the street.

00:47:14.255 --> 00:47:16.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a big groove
going in there.

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So all of sudden you
take the Passion Test,

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and we say put your attention
on those things, put it--

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:24.440 align:middle line:84%
take your little 3 x 5 card once
you know what you're passionate

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.530 align:middle line:84%
about, and you can
tattoo it on your arm--

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where do you put them?

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Anywhere?

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:29.410 align:middle line:84%
You put them on your
dashboard, put them--

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Keep them
next to your dresser.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.768 align:middle line:84%
No, don't put it
on your dashboard.

00:47:31.768 --> 00:47:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Put it on your dresser.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:34.830 align:middle line:84%
You could, but don't
drive and read.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And put it on your mirror, or
put it on your desktop at home,

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:41.720 align:middle line:90%
right, or in your office,

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And put your
attention-- remember

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I said earlier, just
easily and effortlessly

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.550 align:middle line:84%
put your attention on
what you choose to create.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
without straining is

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:55.580 align:middle line:84%
she's starting to
change, and others

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.070 align:middle line:90%
change those neural pathways.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the groove
that's going, I'm homeless,

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm homeless, I'm
homeless, I live--

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she's
truly doing that.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.386 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: -- in a beautiful home.

00:48:03.386 --> 00:48:04.580 align:middle line:90%
I live in a beautiful home.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And then what I say people,
to start consistently

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.730 align:middle line:84%
choosing in favor
of your passion,

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's not always
easy, you use the secret

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to living a passionate life,
which is simply, whenever

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.820 align:middle line:84%
you're faced with a choice, a
decision, or an opportunity,

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:26.340 align:middle line:90%
choose in favor of your passion.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Choose in favor of
your passion, right?

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So OK, right now she
may be living in a home.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.710 align:middle line:84%
She has a choice,
right, she's, you know,

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:35.930 align:middle line:90%
we always have choices.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, if I choose
this, it'll get that.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.570 align:middle line:90%
If I choose that, I'll get that.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Choose in favor of
the opportunities, then?

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, choose
in favor of the thing

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.110 align:middle line:84%
that's in the direction
of your passion.

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you're always choosing
in the direction of what you're

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:51.870 align:middle line:84%
most passionate about, what
happens is you automatically

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.070 align:middle line:84%
move your score up, remember,
we're scoring your passions,

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and eventually there you are
at the door of your passion.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.796 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the things that
you don't want to do fall off,

00:49:00.796 --> 00:49:02.660 align:middle line:84%
because you stay next to the
things you want to do more.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah, exactly.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is what people-- I
don't know why this happens,

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, I'm not a neuroscientist.

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, but I
get emails all the time,

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:13.970 align:middle line:90%
thank you Janet.

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I just got one the other day, my
husband and I were struggling,

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.710 align:middle line:84%
we read "The Passion Test,"
we just did what you said.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:25.730 align:middle line:90%
We were $500,000 in debt.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Our relationship was
just failing miserably.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we just started
using these very simple tools.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And I always say the
Passion Test is a system.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.530 align:middle line:90%
A system.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:40.650 align:middle line:84%
The acronym for system--
Save Yourself Time, Energy,

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.410 align:middle line:90%
and Money.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So the Passion Test, follow
the system of the Passion Test

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and it'll take you from
A to B to C to D to E.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.225 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason
it works that way.

00:49:51.225 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And I get to hear
from people who say it worked,

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:55.970 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: System-- save
yourself time, energy, money.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: The woman who said,
you know, I'm $500,000 in debt

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.040 align:middle line:84%
is no longer in debt
and we're in the black

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and living a happy
life together.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a
system, interesting.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Isn't that good?

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you also do
this for children, right?

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Yeah, oh my God.

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The Passion
Test for kids?

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:11.738 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, the
Passion Test for kids.

00:50:11.738 --> 00:50:14.141 align:middle line:84%
I mean, usually when the
parents bring the kids,

00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:14.890 align:middle line:90%
they're screaming.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't know
what they're coming to,

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.920 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to go, it's
going to take my whole weekend.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's hard to explain.

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: I can't
play with my friends.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I hate this.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: By the time
they leave, they're

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.740 align:middle line:84%
crying because they
don't want to go.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Because the Passion
Test programs,

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:30.390 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing that it
stands for is inspiring

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:32.600 align:middle line:90%
transformation through love.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So imagine walking into
a room full of people

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:39.610 align:middle line:84%
where all you're
getting told and all

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:43.000 align:middle line:84%
you're getting intentioned is
your greatness to come out.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and these kids,
kids are so much better

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.940 align:middle line:90%
than us adults, right?

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:49.000 align:middle line:90%
We get in our heads--

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They have more
of a clean slate, yes.

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:52.584 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: The kids don't
need three steps, you know,

00:50:52.584 --> 00:50:54.959 align:middle line:84%
like what's more important,
if you could have this or not

00:50:54.959 --> 00:50:55.458 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:56.700 align:middle line:90%
They don't need all of that.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Go they go straight to it.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they start getting
clear on what they're

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:04.805 align:middle line:84%
passionate about, they get
so happy and so excited,

00:51:04.805 --> 00:51:06.819 align:middle line:84%
and with the little kids,
what we have them do,

00:51:06.819 --> 00:51:08.610 align:middle line:84%
we have them come up
with only one passion,

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and we do it through-- we write
all these little passions down,

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and we go, all right,
if you could have

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.130 align:middle line:84%
this one, or this one,
or this one, right,

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and then we have them write
out their number one passion.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And then what we have
them do is they draw it.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.027 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Because most children
are really very, very visual,

00:51:23.027 --> 00:51:23.205 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:51:23.205 --> 00:51:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm visual, too.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:24.815 align:middle line:90%
I would love to draw it, too.

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: I'm visual.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.130 align:middle line:90%
I drew mine.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Draw fun.

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: I draw mine, and I'm
living in a log cabin house.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.990 align:middle line:90%
I did a vision board.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
There's my log cabin
house on it, right?

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.736 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And I'm living
in my log cabin house.

00:51:36.736 --> 00:51:37.620 align:middle line:90%
It was right on that.

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.410 align:middle line:84%
What you put your attention
on grows stronger.

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's just the way it works.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.796 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is practical
application of that,

00:51:43.796 --> 00:51:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and I really appreciate you
coming on and explaining it.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.338 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Oh, thank you.

00:51:47.338 --> 00:51:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's such
a great formula,

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and you can do it
over and over again.

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And how many of us
have lost our passion

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.430 align:middle line:90%
that needs to get back on?

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And they change and they morph
as you get what you want.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great, great system,
taught all over the world.

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:02.930 align:middle line:84%
You travel all over
the world teaching it,

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:04.682 align:middle line:90%
and it's a lot of fun.

00:52:04.682 --> 00:52:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, it's fun, and
you know what the most fun is?

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.187 align:middle line:90%
Back to the kids.

00:52:08.187 --> 00:52:10.270 align:middle line:84%
When you get the kids to
get clear on what they're

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:11.922 align:middle line:84%
passionate about,
you get their parents

00:52:11.922 --> 00:52:13.880 align:middle line:84%
to get clear on what
they're passionate about--

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's all aligned.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.048 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: --you have a bridge.

00:52:16.048 --> 00:52:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Because then your
parents can go, honey,

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make sure that
you live that passion full out.

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And there is the bridge.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:25.590 align:middle line:90%
There's the bridge.

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:26.256 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Support.

00:52:26.256 --> 00:52:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: And all of a
sudden-- I just wrote

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.550 align:middle line:90%
this beautiful ebook.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:32.930 align:middle line:84%
It's called, "I Want for
You What You Want for You."

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about this in
terms of the Passion Test,

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.240 align:middle line:84%
how can you want
for anyone what they

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.170 align:middle line:84%
want if you don't
know what they want?

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So the Passion Test
is the very first step

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to helping to support
anyone in the things

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.170 align:middle line:84%
that they have the
greatest passion for.

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And with your kids, if
you do that with them,

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:53.910 align:middle line:90%
give them this little test?

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's supportive.

00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:57.251 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: It's the only
test you will never fail.

00:52:57.251 --> 00:52:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, that's a good one.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a great one to talk to them
about while they're in school.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JANET: Thanks, Lis.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.201 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I've really
enjoyed talking with you.

00:53:05.201 --> 00:53:06.869 align:middle line:84%
I could talk to you
forever; you're fun.

00:53:06.869 --> 00:53:08.910 align:middle line:84%
We have that same thing
aligned, fun is our lead.

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JANET: Yeah, well,
you know, listen to me,

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that's your number one
or number two passion.

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Mine, too, so give
me five, sister.

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:14.264 align:middle line:90%
I love ya.

00:53:14.264 --> 00:53:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Love you, too.
