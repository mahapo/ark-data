He asks, “How can we make the greatest choices for our survival until we know the deepest truths of our existence?” He wrote his latest book, Deep Truth, because these are critical times; never has a generation been faced with so many crises all within the same window in time. \r\n\r\nGregg finds that society is stuck in outmoded ways of thinking because our media and educational institutions are failing to include the latest scientific discoveries in what they disseminate. He tackles our outdated myths head-on, including that nature is based on survival of the strongest or that war and competition are hard-wired into mankind. Cooperation, he insists, is a higher survival principle. And he points to excavations of civilizations twice as ancient as the ones we imagine to be the oldest, with elaborate cities that lack all evidence of war – no walls, no weapons, no mass graves. Looking at these ancient civilizations can reveal alternative approaches.

Do you want to learn how to be more positive or resilient, but don’t know how?  In this eye-opening and potentially life-changing interview with Lisa Garr, Dr Joe Dispenza, a neuroscientist, chiropractor and author, explains how our habits are wired into our brains and what we can do about them.\n\nHe notes, “Nerve cells that fire together, wire together.”  There is something of a feedback loop at work:  As you repeat your activities, the brain’s pathways stay wired to repeat that activity, and so it becomes even more difficult to change. Repetition reinforces brain behavior, and by, say, age 35, our identity becomes a set of memorized behaviors. \n\nChange is possible, but it takes some effort and stepping out of our comfort zone. But every time you have a new thought or new activity, the neurons create new pathways (and there is dramatic video showing this happening). Dr. Dispenza explains the steps you can take to change your life, how it works and why it can be beneficial beyond your ability to imagine.

In this wide-ranging and revealing conversation, Dr. Dossey and Lisa Garr discuss the past, present and future of healing and medicine.\r\n\r\nDr. Dossey describes his own skepticism in his early doctoring days, even resisting a case he observed of a man with terminal lung cancer who not only survived but was also restored to complete health when the only therapy the patient received was prayer. But when early studies produced data showing a positive impact for prayer on healing, Dr. Dossey realized he was not properly serving his patients if he ignored any effective treatment. The more deeply he looked into this power of prayer, the more he came to recognize its significance. Today, he remains one of the leading experts in this field, and he shares with us his belief that your healing intentions and prayers can and do make a difference – not only for you, but for the health of others as well.","teaser":"Do you think the power of prayer has an effect on healing?
