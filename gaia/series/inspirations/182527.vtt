00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Imagine
if you could manifest

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:90%
what you desire instantly.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
When you imagine Italy, you take
a trip to Italy in your mind,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if you
could take that trip

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to Italy several times a
day for 30 straight days?

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:84%
What if we are far more
powerful than we think?

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
and joining me

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:10%
is the founder of
auracolors.com, Pam Oslie, who

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:10%
is here to talk with
us about the five

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:10%
stages of manifestation
and how we

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:10%
can bring the things we
desire in life closer to us

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:10%
through a daily practice.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.432 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PAM OSLIE: Hi, Lisa,
it's great to be here.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So auric colors
and manifestation--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I can't see the link
between the two.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell me?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.832 align:middle line:10%
>>OSLIE: Oh, yeah, well, the
fact that I can see energy

00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:10%
fields, or auras, showed me from
the get-go that we're capable

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:10%
of doing more than
we thought we were,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:10%
that our brain or
our consciousness--

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:10%
it's more than our brain.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that I
can see energy fields

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and colors and psychically
know what those colors mean--

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I explored even more
to go beyond that.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Parallel universes and talking
to people on the other side

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and remote viewing--

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
it's all connected with
expanded consciousness.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you see things
in a different way.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I see things in an
expanded version.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And we all have the ability.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:90%
It's just I've practiced it.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:90%
I've exercised it.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Practiced it more.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So auric colors--
let's just start there.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
When did you first
start seeing auras?

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Was it unusual for you?

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.497 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, first, in 1984,
I went to hear a psychic speak.

00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled me up in front of
the group that night and said,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.288 align:middle line:90%
you know how to do this, too.

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:90%
So I got thrown in the water.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, start doing
readings on people.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And I found out I knew
things about people

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:90%
that I'd never met before.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I knew a woman over to
my right was pregnant

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
because I saw the spirit of
a little girl standing next

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:90%
to her--

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.390 align:middle line:84%
had never happened to
me before in my life.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
She went to the doctor later
and found out she was pregnant.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, she
didn't even know?

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: She didn't
know she was pregnant.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: So I started that way.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And then a year after doing
that, expanded consciousness,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I met a woman who
could see auras.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And I started working
with her and realized

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that what she was
seeing around people

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
matched what I had been picking
up psychically about people.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So then I went, oh,
that's a violet.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a blue.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, I get it.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So within a year of
working with her,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I developed the ability to
see and sense auras myself.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you are looking
at me, for example, right now,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
do you see colors
radiating off of me?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like light off
of a light bulb.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a glow.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I see are
different bands of color.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But when I talk to people,
the most significant bands

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.317 align:middle line:84%
are the two colors
closest to your body.

00:03:09.317 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Some people just have one.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Some have two.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:84%
The outer bands in the
aura, in my experience--

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:90%
other people see it differently.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
In my experience, the two
colors closest to your body

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
reveal your life purpose,
your personality,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
how you are in relationship,
money, potential health issues.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.503 align:middle line:84%
They all show up in what
I call your life colors.

00:03:28.503 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And when
you see this, you

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
don't see it with your
eyes, your physical eyes.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Oh, both.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I see it
with my physical eyes.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And otherwise, I
can tune into it.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
I can see it with an inner sense
with my intuition, which is

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:90%
why I can do it on television.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:90%
I can do it on the radio.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:90%
I can do it on the telephone.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
You can tell me the
name of somebody.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Give me their name, and
I'll go tune into them

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and tell you all about them
because I can see it remotely,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what colors am I?

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: You're
yellow and violet.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.363 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yellow and violet.

00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: I see 14
different aura colors,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:90%
but yellows are creative.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.990 align:middle line:84%
They're big kids at heart,
to tell you the truth.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
They want to do some of this and
some of this and some of this

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:90%
and some of this.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.827 align:middle line:90%
They've got a lot of energy.

00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
They either do creative work or
healing work or physical work,

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%
like they're yoga instructors.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, you're doing so much
violet in this lifetime.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
Violets are the spiritual
leaders and teachers

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and visionaries, not
always spiritual,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:90%
but they're visionaries.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Violets come from the third eye.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:84%
You see how fast I'm
talking with you?

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:90%
That's because you're a violet.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I can get it.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I am plagued by it, actually,
to be honest with you,

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
because I can't not see into
what the future needs to be.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:90%
That's a violet.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:84%
You have the same aura
colors as Oprah and Bono

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:90%
and George Clooney.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Violets came here to help
shift the consciousness

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's ridiculous.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah,
it's a big mission.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And yellows don't want
to work that hard.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
They're like, wait, I want
it to be fun and easy.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And violets go, no,
I have a big mission.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:90%
So it can create conflict.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, my God,
you just nailed me.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly judging
for working so hard.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, yellows have
a sense of humor,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and violets get very
serious and intense.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:90%
But if you put them together--

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.875 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You get
multiple personalities.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:10.937 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:05:10.937 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, they're
creative visionaries.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
They come up with
creative ways of reaching

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:90%
the masses or different things.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Violets get involved in
either the media or the arts,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
or they're teachers
or therapists,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.063 align:middle line:90%
or they get involved in causes.

00:05:25.063 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Some violets get involved
in politics and law,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
but usually yellows don't
like politics and law.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, we're too chill.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.035 align:middle line:84%
So you've been
able to identify--

00:05:33.035 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and there's all sorts
of YouTube videos

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:84%
around this, of you being able
to look at people's colors

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and then do the yellow,
and here's the blue,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and here's the violet.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
But how can we learn to
determine our own color?

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, first of all,
I have quite a free quiz

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:84%
on my website, in my books, so
people can go take the quiz.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
But what I've also noticed
is, once people learn

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
about the different
color personalities,

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
whether they watch the
videos or read the book

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, they tend to start
identifying-- like, they'll

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
read about a tan and go, oh,
my husband has so much tan.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:90%
He's a tan.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:90%
I recognize the qualities.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Or, oh, my son's a red.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I can tell because of what
you've described about a red.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It fits his
personality completely.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so does red
typically mean a specific like

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
anger or love, and
blue means something--

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.555 align:middle line:90%
how did you determine these?

00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Psychically.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, also the woman that
I work with got me started.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
She basically started
describing them.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
But then when I started
doing psychic work on people,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I went way beyond
anything she had told me.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So a red life
color personality--

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:84%
they're very
physical, and they do

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
have a tendency to
have hot tempers.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
truck drivers or dancers.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Madonna's a red.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Lady Gaga's a red.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Sean Penn is red.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
personality type to it,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
but they're very much about
physical beingness, where

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.275 align:middle line:84%
violets are more spiritual
or visionaries or leaders.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But we
can have multiple,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.645 align:middle line:84%
and usually people are
multiple colors, right?

00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, and that's
different than a red

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:90%
in the outer bands.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's got red
in the outer bands,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I know that they're
angry right now.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't always stay.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
That's just-- they're
momentarily angry,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:90%
and then that can go away.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:84%
The outer bands
change all the time.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.293 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's pick
some people that we

00:07:09.293 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
know that are public figures
so that the audience can

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:90%
So take Lady Gaga, for example.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
She did this beautiful
movie, "A Star is Born,"

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
where she was very soft and
very intimate and very feminine.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And then yet her outer
appearance as a celebrity

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
with the incredible
costumes and her dancers--

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:84%
so you see two different
sides of someone there.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Would you say she
has different--

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Well, she was acting.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
I saw her interviewed.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
well, is the woman

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:90%
in the movie more like you?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, no,
just the opposite.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not like that at all.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
No, she's very strong
willed and determined,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:90%
and reds can be very powerful.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would you
say Trump is a red?

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Trump is a
green with yellow.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Greens are businessmen, CEOs,
corporate ladder, money,

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:90%
driven.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I see greens getting
involved in the stock market

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:90%
or in real estate sales.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:90%
They want to accomplish.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:90%
They want to make money.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a positive side
to the colors and a downside.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
In power, greens can
accomplish anything

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:84%
they put their minds to, and
they create jobs for people.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Out of power, you don't
want to mess with a green.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They argue.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.080 align:middle line:90%
They blame.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:90%
They get frustrated.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:90%
They get irritated.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:90%
So violets have a positive side.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Violets have a downside.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They all have a shadow.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, you
want to learn how

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.453 align:middle line:84%
to do the positive side
of your aura colors.

00:08:27.453 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So personally,
you want to learn that.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Take someone
like Obama, for example.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you see his colors?

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: He's a violet yellow
with a little bit of indigo.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So violets are, again,
visionaries, leaders.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Violets usually
want global peace.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:90%
They want people to connect.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:90%
They're communicators.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Yellows are big kids--

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:90%
more playful, sense of humor.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Yellows do have to watch
out for addictions.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.203 align:middle line:90%
So he was smoking.

00:08:53.203 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a yellow thing.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Yellows either are very healthy.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:90%
They exercise.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:90%
They eat right.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:90%
They're very into nutrition.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
They typically don't
look their age,

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:90%
where violets are old souls.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So they go, I'm getting older
and running out of time.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And yellows are like,
no, I'm still a kid.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.260 align:middle line:90%
I haven't grown up yet.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:90%
There's still things to do.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.963 align:middle line:84%
And so yellows out of power,
though, meaning the downside--

00:09:13.963 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
they can get into
either-- and no,

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying Obama did this.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying
yellows, in general--

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
when they're not happy,
yellows procrastinate.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:90%
They run away.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:84%
They get into either drugs,
alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine,

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:90%
chocolate or sweets, overeating.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:90%
They avoid.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a yellow thing.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do we stay in
our power color, essentially?

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, in my books,
too, and on my website, I show--

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:84%
each one of the colors
has a different way

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:90%
of staying in power.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, yellows-- number
one, they have to exercise.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: If yellows don't
exercise, they get depressed.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And you don't tell a blue
to do that because blues

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.578 align:middle line:90%
don't like to exercise.

00:09:50.578 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: And yellows need
to connect with nature.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:90%
That's healthy for them.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.793 align:middle line:84%
And then yellows need to
keep a sense of humor.

00:09:57.793 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So if yellows can
keep a sense of humor,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:90%
they can get through anything.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Violets-- number one for
violets to stay in power,

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
hands down, is some
form of meditation.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Violets have to have quiet time.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They have to have
alone time where

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:84%
they can connect their vision
with their heart and soul

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.402 align:middle line:90%
and something higher than them.

00:10:14.402 --> 00:10:15.485 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And reground, yes.

00:10:15.485 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: It's imperative.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Where yellow sometimes can't sit
still long enough to meditate.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:90%
They need movement.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, OK, so then you
take somebody like Oprah--

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.503 align:middle line:84%
so I'm picking lots of
yellow violets, aren't I?

00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes, you are.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
She's also really
violet with yellow.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you give me another
example of other colors?

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: OK, so a blue yellow--

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Ellen DeGeneres is a blue
yellow, Kate Hudson, Meg Ryan,

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Goldie Hawn.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:90%
They're the girl next door.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Blues-- it's all about
love and helping,

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:90%
and blues get very emotional.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.203 align:middle line:84%
Blues value relationship
more than anything.

00:10:51.203 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're a blue.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.245 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: I'm a blue yellow.

00:10:53.245 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But blues-- it's home and
love and helping people.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They're typically teachers,
counselors, and nurses,

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:90%
but they can also be doormats.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:84%
But they're some of
the most emotional.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Violets are emotional,
but they run really deep.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:90%
They've got a passion to them.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So they don't like injustice or
global suffering, where blues--

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:90%
it's their home--

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
number one for a blue is
marriage, relationship.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, so interesting.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So you can take this and
you can find your partner

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
with various different types
of color matches, right?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that on
your auracolors.com.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, I
have love colors.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Love colors, yes.

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: People can
connect with other people

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:84%
with compatible
aura colors, friends

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:84%
or significant relationship,
because certain colors are very

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.910 align:middle line:84%
compatible, and other
colors are going

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
to have a really
rough time together.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, a green
with a yellow--

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.923 align:middle line:84%
so it's interesting that some
people are green and yellow.

00:11:49.923 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Meryl Streep has
green and yellow.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:84%
She uses that in an
empowered, creative way.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
The greens are driven
workaholics, money, accomplish.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:90%
They're workaholics.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:90%
And yellows want to go play.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Yellows out of power
can be big babies.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
They can pout and be babies,
and, I'm going to take my ball

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:90%
and go home.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want
to work that hard.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But when they're in
power, they're creative,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:90%
and they've got lots of energy.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:90%
So that can work.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.987 align:middle line:84%
But as a couple, that's
a real challenge.

00:12:18.987 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because one wants to
play and one wants to work.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: And the green can start
becoming a vindictive parent

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.140 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
They're like, you
should be doing this,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.345 align:middle line:84%
and you need to work hard,
and you need to do this.

00:12:29.345 --> 00:12:32.837 align:middle line:84%
And they can really break the
spirit of a little yellow.

00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's a personality
profiling in a sense

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
of understanding
yourself better,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
understanding other
people better.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it helps
you get a head start

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.840 align:middle line:90%
on who you're relating with.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, it helps
validate a person

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
so people have permission
to be who they really are.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I know that when people find
out about their aura colors

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:84%
they go, oh, no wonder I
felt that way my whole life.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:84%
No wonder that's what I
wanted to do for a career,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
but I was told I
couldn't do that.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:90%
It validates them.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It helps give them permission
to be who they really are.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And then it helps us
understand each other.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So instead of people
running around going,

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:90%
why can't you be more like me?

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Why can't you
think more like me?

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
You go, oh, you're a lavender.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Or, you're a crystal.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I understand what
your personality

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:90%
is now and your priorities.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:90%
You're different.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Then we start
honoring each other,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:90%
and we can speak their language.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.432 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever
look at the colors

00:13:24.432 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:84%
to someone who's done
something horrible,

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
like some of the shooters or
someone who's maybe committed

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:90%
suicide or something like that?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you look at that to
understand it better?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, and the
majority of people that are

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:90%
incarcerated--

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:84%
the majority of them
have red overlays.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of reds performing
acts of physical violence.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I see greens doing things
more like embezzling.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Bernie Madoff is green.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The shadow side.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.572 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, the shadow side.

00:13:51.572 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But most of the people
that I've seen incarcerated

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
have red overlays, and that's
different than a red life

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:90%
color.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.490 align:middle line:84%
When I see a red
overlay around someone,

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that's someone who's had some
trauma in their childhood.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
They were either
physically, mentally,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:84%
or emotionally abandoned,
rejected, abused,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:84%
or they had a
life-threatening situation

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and thought that they
were going to die.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they put red in the
outer bands for protection,

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:84%
but what it turns into
is either intense anger,

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:90%
or it turns into self sabotage.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, red overlays--

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and there is a way to heal that.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now, that's great.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.878 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic.

00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, if you could
tell someone that,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
then they could maybe prevent
a life of crime or something

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
where they get sucked into
the system, so to speak.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And then violets,
especially these days,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
because we're in a
violet age right now--

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.363 align:middle line:84%
one of the main things I've
seen with violets is depression.

00:14:47.363 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Violets have a
tendency-- if they're not

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
doing what they came
here to do, if they

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
can't live that huge vision
and huge life purpose,

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:90%
they get very depressed.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting an eagle in
a little, tiny hamster cage.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
they're so off purpose.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is happening
a lot lately.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.365 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So one of
the reasons why

00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I love doing this
show is because we're

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
living in such a
different time now,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.030 align:middle line:84%
even more different than
it was 10 years ago.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:90%
It's intense.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:90%
It's quick.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It's changing very
fast, and it's extreme.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we need these
tools and techniques

00:15:24.805 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
to be able to carry
us through these times

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.250 align:middle line:84%
so that we can be
the help to others

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that we want to be
and to ourselves

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
as well so we're
not falling prey

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:90%
to so many different agendas.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So how would you take what
you do with aura colors

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:46.928 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to suffering,
to pain, to extreme change?

00:15:46.928 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, if I'm just going
to focus on the aura colors,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I help each individual
with their colors

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:84%
know how to stay in balance,
because each one of them

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:90%
has a different way.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.297 align:middle line:90%
Greens have a different way.

00:15:57.297 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Blues have a different way of
staying balanced and in power.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going to
go to the big level--

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because what I believe is why
things are happening today--

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.645 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to wake up.

00:16:08.645 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to shift our
consciousness to a higher

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
level of being because,
Lisa, the old way's

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:90%
not working anymore.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's clear.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.492 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: The old paradigm
is falling apart.

00:16:16.492 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's happened over history.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through different
eras where things fall apart.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:90%
So it looks scary.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And every time
there's a major shift,

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:90%
there's always chaos, always.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the way I see
it is the old concrete

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:84%
is breaking loose so that
new growth can come through.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's scary when people want
things to maintain the same.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
They want security
and stability,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and yet, the way I see
it-- because, again, I

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:90%
can do psychic work.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I've proven to
myself that we are

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:84%
more than we've been
raised to believe,

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that we're way more
expansive, way more powerful.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like the key is to
really discover who we really

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:84%
are so we're not creating the
same painful, drama, victim

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:90%
consciousness--

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
it's more awake and
aware and evolved

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.097 align:middle line:90%
and that we start realizing--

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I know this will
blow some people out.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But some of your listeners
already know this.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.279 align:middle line:90%
We're actually creators.

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: We're creating
our experiences.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:90%
We're creating our reality.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's quantum physics.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:84%
It's not just woo woo, some
sort of spiritual, ungrounded.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:90%
It's actually quantum physics.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's also
like we're trying to build

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:90%
the Colosseum with chopsticks.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're creating, but we
don't have the tools quite yet

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
to create at the level
that we need to create at.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.435 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: The tools
are available.

00:17:39.435 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:90%
We have the tools.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.785 align:middle line:90%
I've learned a lot of the tools.

00:17:43.785 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So even though I'm a blue
yellow, I've added violet.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
My whole thing is I go inside
first to see how I can evolve,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:84%
what I know, a higher truth,
a more loving, more advanced

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and
then I teach that.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is around the
five levels of manifestation

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:90%
that you teach now.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Your work has evolved from the
aura colors and still the aura

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:84%
colors, but this is
the secret sauce here.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, it's really
about consciousness.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, I get so excited
to see who we really are.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
We're so busy being
little ants on the planet,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
worrying about how we make
money and filling up our cars

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
with gas instead
of really realizing

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.380 align:middle line:84%
how magical and
amazing we really are.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So yes, my focus is on
shifting the consciousness.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to get into that
five levels of manifestation?

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, definitely.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: OK, now, I'm borrowing
this from Deepak Chopra,

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
but it still fits with a lot
of stuff I've been doing.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:90%
So he uses the example--

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:84%
let's say you have the
desire for ice cream.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, level one consciousness,
the way we think and the way we

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:90%
believe--

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:84%
at level one, we have to go out,
interview for a job, get a job,

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.297 align:middle line:84%
work hard, make the money, get
the paycheck, get in the car,

00:19:04.297 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:84%
drive to the ice
cream store, and then

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.463 align:middle line:84%
you finally get to
get your ice cream,

00:19:07.463 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:90%
and then you get to eat it.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, we're living at level
one state of consciousness,

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:90%
which is hard work.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of activity,
a lot of action.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's linear.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And and so level two--

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:90%
and I do this one a lot.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:90%
It's so much fun, Lisa.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:90%
So level two is--

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
you have the desire
for ice cream,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and a friend stops by
on that day and goes,

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I was just in the neighborhood
and I just went to the store

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:90%
and I bought some ice cream.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:90%
You want to have it with me?

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:90%
There was no effort.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
There was the desire to have
ice cream, and it showed up.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Somebody else cooperated.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:84%
There was a synchronicity that
showed up, and a lot of us

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
have had those
experiences, many ways.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.843 align:middle line:90%
We call them weird.

00:19:45.843 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
intentional, huh?

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
They're how we
manifest at a level

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:84%
when we stop believing
that level one is

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
the only way that reality
works but that there's

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:90%
another level of how we create.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Then level two becomes
easier and more fun.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, level three
consciousness is--

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.733 align:middle line:84%
you have the desire
for ice cream.

00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:90%
You go to the freezer.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:90%
You open it up.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.632 align:middle line:90%
And there's ice cream in there.

00:20:09.632 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And you go, I don't
remember buying ice cream.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.713 align:middle line:90%
But there it is, right?

00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It manifested.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've had experiences in
level two and three a lot,

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're becoming more and
more ingrained in my lifestyle.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you,
Lisa, it's so much more fun.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:90%
It's easier.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:90%
There's less drama.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:84%
When it shows up it's
like, oh, my gosh.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.813 align:middle line:90%
That really happened.

00:20:29.813 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:90%
And so I play with it a lot.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.768 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
things you have

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
to shift your beliefs of
reality to be able to operate

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:90%
at these different levels.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Level four is-- you have
the desire for ice cream.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And you open your
hand, and it's there.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the great master
teachers on the planet--

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Christ, for example--

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I understand Sai Baba
knew how to do that.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The water into wine.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, water into
wine, walking on water,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.100 align:middle line:90%
fishes and loaves--

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:90%
that's level four.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I haven't gotten there yet.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'd like to learn
how to turn water into wine.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.277 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: That would be fun.

00:21:06.277 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, we've changed the weather.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
We've done things
with the weather

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
by knowing these different
principles of consciousness

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and quantum physics.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:90%
And then level five--

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:84%
we've come from, so level
five's not that exciting to us.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Level five is-- you have
the desire for ice cream,

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that you
and the ice cream are one.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:90%
It's all just thought.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Its energy.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like, eh, I
want to taste ice cream.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to know I'm
one with the ice cream.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.510 align:middle line:90%
I want to taste it.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be able
to have the ability

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
to know how to go
from one, two, three,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:90%
or four with conscious choice.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Yes, there's so
many questions I have for you.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So the level one
is the more linear.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And the level two we've
evolved every now and then

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
into because we call them
synchronicities or coincidences

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But we, on this
show, really act as

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
if it's possible to
begin to manifest that.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.238 align:middle line:90%
How do you get from one to two?

00:22:05.238 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, the first
thing you've got to know

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.470 align:middle line:84%
is you've got to
believe it's possible.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And second of all,
learning that we've been

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:90%
taught that this is physical.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything's physical
and separate from us.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.995 align:middle line:90%
That's very Newtonian physics.

00:22:18.995 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds
like a big word,

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:24.050 align:middle line:84%
but it just means Newton, that
the universe is mechanistic,

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and it deteriorates, and
it dies, and all that bit.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.552 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught that,
and we've bought into it.

00:22:28.552 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:90%
We've believed that.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics is saying
something entirely different,

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
that it's energy
and consciousness.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So most people are not going
to read quantum physics.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:90%
They can't even grasp it.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But when you understand
that there's atoms in space

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and then in the atoms,
it's subatomic particles,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:90%
there's really nothing solid.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:84%
When you start getting that
it's all energy and that

00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, our beliefs,
which give rise to our emotions,

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:90%
which is energy in motion--

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:90%
that's what creates things.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Once you really get that
that's a truth, not a woo woo--

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.980 align:middle line:90%
that's an actual fact.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a truth.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And you start
experimenting with it

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and you allow for that
possibility to happen.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.448 align:middle line:84%
That's why the law of
attraction operates out of that.

00:23:21.448 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a good idea.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.365 align:middle line:90%
It's a great concept.

00:23:23.365 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: And it works.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.915 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't just
tell other people,

00:23:25.915 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:84%
well, you've got
to believe this.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I actually go out and experiment
with it to see if it's real,

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:90%
and it is.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And so the more evidence I
get, the more I see it's real.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways to
really shift into that, too,

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed, is
quiet, detaching.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:84%
It's called going
into the field,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
because the other thing
that quantum physics says

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:90%
is there's no empty space.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:90%
This looks empty, but it's not.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you get quiet and
you detach from the drama,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:90%
from the story--

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:84%
because, Lisa, we get so
wound up in our stories.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:84%
We get emotionally
charged by our stories.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I want to talk with
you about that interference.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I just want the
listeners to know

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that, as you're going through
this experience with Pam,

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.730 align:middle line:84%
treat this as a
masterclass today.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Treat this as a way
where you can really

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:84%
learn to go from level
one to level two,

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
go through this.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.552 align:middle line:84%
I want you apply yourself
as you're listening to this.

00:24:22.552 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So we go from level
one, which is linear.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.663 align:middle line:84%
We go to level two,
which is in the quantum.

00:24:26.663 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
someone shows up and then

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:90%
the ice cream.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, it's a
coincidence, right?

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go to
level three and you open

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
your eyes and the
ice cream is there,

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
how do you get by all of
the interferences in the way

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:84%
between the field, where
you have the fear coming in

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:84%
or the disbelief or
somebody else's disbelief

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
or you have a tragic
incident, a crisis?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.665 align:middle line:90%
All of these are interferences.

00:24:56.665 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you're
sitting here trying

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
to protect you're a
little vision of the ice

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
cream appearing, and it's
like everything around you.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.122 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, and
that's what it is.

00:25:06.122 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
All the master teachers
have all said, be still.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Be still and know.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, be still
and know I am God.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Be still and know thyself.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So a key is what I just said,
is detaching from the story,

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:84%
from the drama, which
is challenging to do

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:90%
because some of those stories--

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:90%
they scare us.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.060 align:middle line:90%
They're very convincing.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:90%
We are really good storytellers.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You said
we're creating them.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: We are.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How?

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:90%
How are we creating devastation?

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Sometimes we
create it for the emotion,

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.640 align:middle line:90%
for the experience of it.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we create
drama to see who

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
we are, to see if
we can overcome it,

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.337 align:middle line:84%
for the same reason
we go to movies.

00:25:44.337 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
people that actually

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
like going to horror
movies or war movies

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:52.110 align:middle line:84%
or slash and burn things or
chase and gunfire and whatever,

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:90%
and I go, ah!

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But people like the
adrenaline rush of that.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.172 align:middle line:84%
So to say, why would
we create drama?

00:25:58.172 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
We want to know
what it feels like.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:90%
We want the story.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:84%
If everything was la-le,
la-le, la-le all the time,

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
we might be afraid we
were going to get bored.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The wildfires were
happening at the same time

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.650 align:middle line:84%
my father was going
through heart surgery,

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:90%
lifesaving heart surgery.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And this adrenaline
was running in my body.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, it allowed
me to be so focused.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, I couldn't
tell, because it was maybe

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:84%
too much focus and too
on task, but I felt

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:90%
like I could handle it all.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, I did
on a different level

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.220 align:middle line:84%
than I think I've
handled it before.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: And that's the other
reason we do this, Lisa.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time we're
creating unconsciously.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that
we're creating it

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.105 align:middle line:84%
because, at level one,
everything looks separate.

00:26:49.105 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that
that's separate

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.740 align:middle line:90%
and I have no say over that.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm not connected.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing I
can do about it.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:90%
That's victim and separation.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, a lot of
times we create these things

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:90%
unconsciously.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that
we're creating them.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So becoming more and
more aware that this

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.610 align:middle line:84%
is our manifestation,
first of all.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Then you get to step
back and go, OK,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:84%
am I doing this to help
me learn something?

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.715 align:middle line:84%
Am I doing this to bring
me up to a higher level?

00:27:16.715 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you've
been through the fires.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: I'm in Santa Barbara.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
How could you possibly say
that those fires are a creation

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:90%
or a manifestation of our own?

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
They seem so external,
the circumstances.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Right, and most
people don't like hearing this

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because we've gotten so
into blame and and victim

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that people don't
want to own responsibility.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But the more I
own responsibility

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
for what's going on, creative
power over what's going on,

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:90%
the less I'm afraid of it.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So I can tell you my theory of
why these fires are happening.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:90%
We're very connected.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Look at-- we've got cell
phones and the internet,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and we just accept that that
energy is waves of information

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:90%
going across the ethers, right?

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.465 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All day long.

00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: And it
affects things, right?

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed how much
anger is going on on the planet

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
right now and how much anger
is going on in this country?

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Divisiveness.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: It's created fire.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:90%
The grief.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.885 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
felt waves of grief--

00:28:17.885 --> 00:28:18.685 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hurricanes.

00:28:18.685 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: --at the water,
the floods, the hurricanes.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
That's an indication
of grief, the tears.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So we are all connected,
and a lot of people--

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
they're not ready
to hear that yet.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I offer what I've learned, what
I've discovered for myself,

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
what I've experimented
and proved to myself.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.338 align:middle line:84%
I don't expect other
people to get that, one,

00:28:41.338 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:84%
if they're not ready
for that; two, if they

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.750 align:middle line:90%
don't want to think that way.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.865 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I mean, if
you've lost your home,

00:28:46.865 --> 00:28:48.740 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be
going into this higher

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.823 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness of
the grief and the tears.

00:28:50.823 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be in survival.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.027 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
be at that moment.

00:28:54.027 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Although
some people are not.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Some people are going--

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I've seen that.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: --OK, I get it.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing to me.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's incredible.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: One of the reasons
we create some of these things

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.600 align:middle line:84%
even subconsciously,
unconsciously-- as mile markers

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:90%
to see how far we've come.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:84%
You reacted differently
to the trauma

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that just happened to you than
you would have 10 years ago.

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For sure.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have friends
who have lost their homes,

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:90%
and their perspective's amazing.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:90%
They say, it's OK.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:90%
We'll start over.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:90%
We're being taken care of.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.587 align:middle line:90%
We've had so many friends.

00:29:25.587 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's giving
us an opportunity

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:90%
to walk our talk, Lisa.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
communities that are

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.222 align:middle line:84%
being built around these
natural disasters are amazing.

00:29:32.222 --> 00:29:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, and connection
and compassion and awareness

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and waking up.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: People wanting to
help, truly wanting to help.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what's
happening with the government

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:84%
or anything, they really want
to be a part of the solution.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Right, so sometimes
it's a way to wake us up.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a
way to connect us.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a way
for us to show ourselves

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:90%
how far we've come.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if we can also
be creative and powerful

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:84%
manifestors, if we
manifest something

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:02.250 align:middle line:84%
like a divorce, a bankruptcy, a
job, loss a death, and disease,

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:06.210 align:middle line:84%
yet we can also creatively
manifest a different result,

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.060 align:middle line:90%
We're that powerful.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.420 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing, Lisa.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Look at all the movies that
have taught us, oh, power's bad.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Power is greedy, and
people abuse power.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So we've actually been
taught to fear our power.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:10%
And if we knew what absolute
loving, light filled,

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:10%
amazing, divine
beings we really are,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:10%
we wouldn't fear our power.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.060 align:middle line:10%
We would relish it.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.380 align:middle line:10%
We would celebrate it.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.470 align:middle line:10%
We'd be so much happier
and so much more alive.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And there would be less poverty,
less suffering, less trauma

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:43.002 align:middle line:84%
going on because we
realize who we really are.

00:30:43.002 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Girl, I look at this
in the women's movement.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at
how long women have

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.935 align:middle line:84%
wanted to play small, needed
to play small, needed to hide.

00:30:49.935 --> 00:30:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Were told
that they needed to.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.518 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Taught to hide.

00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And now women are coming
into this beautiful power.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it gets
a little crazy.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's this wielding of
a sense of divine power,

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.690 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to get balanced.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: That's what
we're going for.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.725 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing the
whole thing up.

00:31:06.725 --> 00:31:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's all
violet energy coming up.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Violet is the power female.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the feminine.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the goddess Diana.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.890 align:middle line:90%
It's the power female.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So violets are speakers and
communicators and teachers

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and leaders, and they want
fairness and bring it up

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level
of consciousness.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this goes for
men, too, that are coming out

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're speaking in their
corporations or platforms

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:84%
or wherever they are, and
it's OK to be vulnerable.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to be sensitive.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to lead from that
perspective as a male as well.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, and I see it
as a balance between the male

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and female within each one of
us, the yin and yang within.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we start balancing
our own yin and yang within,

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:90%
then that's what shows up.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just men or women.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.963 align:middle line:90%
It's the inner.

00:31:51.963 --> 00:31:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Isn't it interesting now
that gender neutrality has come

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:90%
into play and all of that--

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: That's all indigo.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --fluidity?

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: That's Indigo Age.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into
the Indigo Age.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:01.373 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's that?

00:32:01.373 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Indigos
are very spiritual,

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:84%
but they tend to be
very androgynous.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Michael Jackson was
an indigo with violet.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And they're here to teach--

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to live, not to teach
us-- to live soul to soul.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not about if
somebody's gay,

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.030 align:middle line:84%
straight, male,
female, black, white.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not any of that.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
They're showing us how
to live soul to soul.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, human to human.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And what it does,
in my perspective,

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:84%
is it illuminates
and almost turns it

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.230 align:middle line:84%
into a fury of
those that are still

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:38.270 align:middle line:84%
in that divisiveness,
that racist perspective.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
more and more angry.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Anger stems from fear.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Anger always stems from fear.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Around the neutrality.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:84%
The more the neutrality
becomes expanded,

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:54.650 align:middle line:84%
the more the divisiveness
gets like a monster,

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.550 align:middle line:90%
in my perspective.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: The fear comes up.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:90%
People are afraid of change.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of survival.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.750 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of loss.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:05.010 align:middle line:90%
It's all fear.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:09.742 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I don't
have fear around any of this.

00:33:09.742 --> 00:33:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I have places where I
used still have judgment.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I see a
judgment, I look inside.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I go, where am I holding those
same qualities, maybe not

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:84%
to that extreme, but it's
still an aspect of me.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:84%
When I shift inside, then
the outer things shift.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't it Wayne
Dyer that said, when

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:84%
you change the things you look
at, the things you look at

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:90%
change?

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.520 align:middle line:90%
So we are connected.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.320 align:middle line:84%
That's spiritual teachings,
that we're all connected.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's literal.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.900 align:middle line:90%
It's quantum physics.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're getting to that
third level of manifestation.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.770 align:middle line:90%
We are, as a culture--

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:90%
we want to go there.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're having that
push, pull, that fight,

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.680 align:middle line:84%
that inner fight, that
tantrum as a society

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.610 align:middle line:90%
before we get there.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.152 align:middle line:84%
Many people I've
heard say that we're

00:33:55.152 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:84%
in an adolescent
phase of society

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and that we are
having those fits

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and tantrums as a
culture as we go

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:90%
through these different changes.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.505 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: And I think we're
tired of the old way, Lisa.

00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, I don't
know about you,

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.677 align:middle line:84%
but I'm tired of
working that hard.

00:34:11.677 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
supposed to be that way.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing some of
the young kids going,

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:16.469 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
work at a job that I

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:18.475 align:middle line:90%
don't like like my parents did.

00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be chained to
a desk doing something just

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:90%
for money.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.409 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I want more fun, more freedom.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that shows that
we're moving from level one,

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:32.639 align:middle line:84%
only out of choice if we want to
do level one, to two and three

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:33.760 align:middle line:90%
because it's easier.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I'm tired
of working that hard,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't feel right.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.219 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let's talk about that.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:41.490 align:middle line:90%
So there's that density of--

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:90%
not density.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.679 align:middle line:90%
It's almost a reality.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:90%
You have to work to make money.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Really.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:48.769 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:34:48.769 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
that's a belief?

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.238 align:middle line:84%
And we've always--
the work ethic.

00:34:53.238 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And the harder you
work, the more you make.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And I go, really?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.858 align:middle line:84%
Do you know the hardest
working people on this planet

00:34:57.858 --> 00:34:59.910 align:middle line:84%
are probably coal miners
and ditch diggers,

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and they make the
least amount of money?

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.920 align:middle line:84%
We actually pay the
most amount of money

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:90%
to people who play for a living.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Google.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Amazon.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: They play sports.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.450 align:middle line:90%
They play roles in movies.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:90%
They play music.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So on some level,
on some deep level,

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:84%
we acknowledge that
play is important.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We do.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.010 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's true.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So now that punches holes in
that belief system right there.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: And I mean, I've shared
with you many stories of how,

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.020 align:middle line:90%
instead of working real hard--

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:90%
I had the desire to go to Maui.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.858 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, God, how am
I going to pull that off?

00:35:34.858 --> 00:35:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cost
money, blah, blah, blah.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:37.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I
went, no, I'm not

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.580 align:middle line:84%
going to do it the old
way, because then I

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:90%
have to work hard.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:41.200 align:middle line:90%
I have to navigate it.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I have to figure out
how to pay for it.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.093 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do it that way.

00:35:44.093 --> 00:35:45.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to shift to level two.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And a brand new client
called me up right

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.203 align:middle line:84%
after I did a session
for him and said,

00:35:50.203 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:90%
I really liked that reading.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.328 align:middle line:90%
I have a condo in Maui.

00:35:52.328 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:90%
You want to go stay there?

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes, please.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening
more and more and more.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
you believe it can.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, because,
more than just believe,

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:90%
I have a sense that's the truth.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:84%
It's more the
truth about reality

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that our thoughts
and our beliefs

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and our emotional energy create.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And so if we believe
we have to work hard

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:15.910 align:middle line:84%
or that we're going to get
sick or that we're going to age

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:84%
or that we're going to die,
that's what we're going to do.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are people that
don't do it that way.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Haven't you seen people
that seem blessed?

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Things just come easy to them?

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.942 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, it's interesting.

00:36:26.942 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I've mean, I was watching a
lot of our aging population

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.030 align:middle line:90%
aging in a very unhealthy way.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And I understand there's so
much more toxicity in our world

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.460 align:middle line:90%
than we've ever had.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And I look at that,
and I think to myself,

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:90%
I am going to age gracefully.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I am going to age healthy.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I am going to exercise
until my last days.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I want that perspective,
and I want to shift.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Despite everything
around me, I really

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.470 align:middle line:90%
want that to be the case.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.905 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying I have to
have more than the desire.

00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: You don't have to.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.110 align:middle line:90%
You get to.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to say is you have

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:06.885 align:middle line:84%
a belief that people around
you are aging unhealthily.

00:37:06.885 --> 00:37:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I look at it.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: I have the
opposite belief.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And I see people
around me going, wow,

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:14.245 align:middle line:84%
they look way younger than my
grandparents did at their age.

00:37:14.245 --> 00:37:16.120 align:middle line:84%
They look way younger,
and they're healthier,

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're more aware of
their health than my parents

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:90%
and my grandparents ever were.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So I see a shift in people
getting more health conscious

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and living longer.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.710 align:middle line:90%
We are living longer.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True, for sure.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: So when
you have a belief,

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.220 align:middle line:84%
you are going to gather
evidence to support that belief.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:84%
When you have a belief,
you will gather evidence

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:90%
to support that belief.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways
to shift a belief--

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote this in my book
"Make Your Dreams Come True"--

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.220 align:middle line:84%
when you have a belief
that's limiting you,

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.052 align:middle line:84%
find a different belief, even
though it looks opposite.

00:37:51.052 --> 00:37:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, no,
but this is the one.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.218 align:middle line:84%
This is the real
one because you've

00:37:54.218 --> 00:37:55.390 align:middle line:90%
gathered so much evidence.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:90%
You've made it very real.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:84%
If you start looking
for a different belief,

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.220 align:middle line:84%
start gathering evidence to
support that belief is true,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:90%
and watch how your life changes.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Watch how your
perspective changes.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Watch how everything changes.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.320 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people like
Anita Moorjani shifting--

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.990 align:middle line:84%
she died of cancer and came
back with no cancer in her body.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In a matter of weeks.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: That shows us that
what we believe about the body

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and health and aging and what
we have to do to stay healthy--

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.950 align:middle line:84%
there's something else
going on, and there

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
are living examples to show
us that something else is

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.790 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.832 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, we might
see that for other people.

00:38:32.832 --> 00:38:34.390 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it ourselves?

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a matter of
switching your belief?

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Is there a practice?

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, number
one, it's awareness.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.192 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it's awareness,
because what I do now

00:38:42.192 --> 00:38:43.442 align:middle line:90%
is I go, oh, blah, blah, blah.

00:38:43.442 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And I go, wait, is
that reality or is

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.822 align:middle line:90%
that just my belief about it?

00:38:46.822 --> 00:38:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, if
I have a belief,

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to see it that way.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'll stop myself and
go, is that a reality

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:90%
or is that my perception?

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Am I creating a story around it?

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And then I stop.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.308 align:middle line:90%
I go, I don't like that story.

00:39:00.308 --> 00:39:01.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do that.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:84%
No, but Pam, it's
very convincing.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:90%
That's reality.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.050 align:middle line:90%
And people will tell you that.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.730 align:middle line:90%
No, Pam, that's reality.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I go, it's just a
story about reality.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:84%
How about if we start
telling a different story?

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But you understand how
people are attached to it?

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.400 align:middle line:90%
So I stop.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:90%
I question it.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:18.250 align:middle line:90%
I detach from the story.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I get calm.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.390 align:middle line:84%
What I do is I go
into the field.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.910 align:middle line:90%
I go into that quantum field.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.290 align:middle line:90%
I connect with it.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I release all the old stuff.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Like when whales go
really deep, they're

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.240 align:middle line:90%
releasing barnacles off of them.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They dive really deep, and the
barnacles can't stay on them.

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.690 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the ways
they get rid of barnacles.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:39.560 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, I go really deep.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.360 align:middle line:90%
I connect.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I go, it's just a story.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.200 align:middle line:84%
What story do I want
to have instead?

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And I start imagining
a different truth,

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:51.340 align:middle line:84%
a different story, a different
movie, a different scenario.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not, Lisa, it happens.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even if it involves
other people, like a boss?

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Oh, yeah,
parallel universes.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so
say there's a boss

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.050 align:middle line:84%
or there's a job that is going
away or layoffs are happening,

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and you think you're
going to get fired.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
How do you go into this--
what did you call it?

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Parallel universes?

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I'm really going
to challenge people,

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.250 align:middle line:90%
but this is scientific.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Hawking was even talking
about parallel universes.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:84%
They have scientific evidence
that parallel universes exist.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, so what I'm going
to do is give you an example,

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.842 align:middle line:90%
and people understand this.

00:40:28.842 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Right now, in the room
you're sitting in,

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:84%
there's at least 10 radio
stations broadcasting around,

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and those radio waves
are around us right here.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't know they're
going on because we're not

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.800 align:middle line:90%
tuned into them.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.600 align:middle line:84%
If you turned on
a radio right now

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.732 align:middle line:84%
and, say, adjusted
it to 99.9, you're

00:40:44.732 --> 00:40:46.190 align:middle line:84%
going to hear the
show that's going

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.867 align:middle line:90%
on there-- the music, the talk.

00:40:47.867 --> 00:40:48.950 align:middle line:90%
That becomes your reality.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's your frequency

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: It's a frequency.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you adjust it and
turn it to, say, 107, now

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
that's your reality.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You're hearing the music and the
talk that's on that frequency.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, 99.9 is still
all around you.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:04.580 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.320 align:middle line:84%
But you're not tuned
into it right now.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You're not set to
that frequency.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's not part of your
reality, but it still exists.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.010 align:middle line:90%
So there are parallel universes.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing is I
studied it in quantum physics.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.067 align:middle line:84%
I learned it, and I
went, OK, if that's true,

00:41:19.067 --> 00:41:20.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to experiment with it.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And I have done dramatic proof
that those are real, dramatic.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have time to
go into all the stories,

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.410 align:middle line:84%
but I think I wrote about
some of them in my book.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You just tune
into the different levels

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.560 align:middle line:84%
of creation, different
levels and frequencies.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: What I do is I
know every time you have

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:84%
a thought or an imagination,
believe it or not,

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:84%
according to
spirituality and physics,

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that image becomes
reality immediately.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:47.930 align:middle line:90%
It already exists.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:84%
That's even in
law of attraction.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.330 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you use
your imagination

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:90%
to imagine something--

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.462 align:middle line:84%
there's a you that got
married to somebody else

00:41:57.462 --> 00:41:58.670 align:middle line:90%
when you were in high school.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a you that never
got married at all.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.260 align:middle line:84%
For every time
you make a choice,

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.368 align:middle line:84%
another you splits off and goes
off and has that whole reality.

00:42:06.368 --> 00:42:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds like
science fiction, but it's real.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, because
how can I tap into that?

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: You can if
you believe it exists.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: No, I can't tap into
my high school boyfriend

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:17.870 align:middle line:90%
and be married to him right now.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.327 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:42:19.327 --> 00:42:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Because you
don't believe it.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:23.000 align:middle line:90%
But I've done that.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I've shifted from one reality
where I wasn't with somebody

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:90%
and they said, no way.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be with you.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.362 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in love with you.

00:42:29.362 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Went to the east
coast, went far away.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.112 align:middle line:84%
And I went, OK, that's
in reality one over here.

00:42:35.112 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm in love with this person.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I really believe I
choose to be with him.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I used my imagination to go
into a different frequency

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.520 align:middle line:90%
where we were together.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We have been together
now for 35 years.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was that
his will or yours?

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: There's two him.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.780 align:middle line:84%
There's still a one that
exists on the east coast,

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.238 align:middle line:84%
having a whole life
off on his own.

00:42:58.238 --> 00:42:59.038 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:42:59.038 --> 00:43:00.690 align:middle line:84%
There's "Sliding
Doors," "Frequency."

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.148 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
movies about this.

00:43:02.148 --> 00:43:03.510 align:middle line:90%
"Back to the Future."

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.750 align:middle line:84%
That's all about
parallel universes.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So in this reality,
I chose to align

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.290 align:middle line:84%
with the one that loved me
and wanted to be with me

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and wanted to hang out with me.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.362 align:middle line:90%
I chose that one.

00:43:15.362 --> 00:43:17.570 align:middle line:84%
He's in that one, but he's
also in this one over here

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:18.830 align:middle line:90%
we chose not to.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have to change him.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds
weird, but it works.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I've done it with
life and death.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:90%
I've done it with the weather.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.080 align:middle line:90%
I've done it with home.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I've proven this parallel
universe stuff all the time.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But the key is you
have to so believe

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:37.670 align:middle line:84%
that this reality is real
and completely drop this one.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.830 align:middle line:90%
And we do it all the time.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:84%
We're changing
realities all the time.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.483 align:middle line:84%
We're changing
channels all the time,

00:43:44.483 --> 00:43:46.400 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know it
because they're seamless.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no walls.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So we think we're
just in one, but we're

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.380 align:middle line:90%
shifting all the time.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's like time zones.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:84%
They shift, and you
can fly across them.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, radio stations.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:58.470 align:middle line:90%
You adjust it.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We can tell the
difference, but we

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.638 align:middle line:84%
believe there's
different radio stations.

00:44:01.638 --> 00:44:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, how did you
do it with the weather?

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.615 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: I went to Hawaii once.

00:44:06.615 --> 00:44:08.240 align:middle line:84%
That's one of my
favorite places to go.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I was landing, and the
pilot said, by the way,

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.700 align:middle line:84%
the weather forecast is
rain this entire week.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, no, no, no,
no, no, not on my vacation.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm not spending a
week here in the rain.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So that night I
did a visualization

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.570 align:middle line:84%
where I went into
a reality where

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.660 align:middle line:84%
it was beautiful sunshine, and
I believed that really exists,

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.550 align:middle line:90%
just like this one exists.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The quantum field is
all possibilities.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:84%
In spirituality, they say, with
God, all things are possible.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.600 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics,
it's all unmanifest.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.760 align:middle line:84%
It's our thoughts that
bring things into manifest.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.310 align:middle line:90%
But we're infinite beings.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:44.450 align:middle line:90%
We're infinite.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:48.050 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean we're just a
little soul trapped in a body.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So I believed that there was a
reality where it was sunshine.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So the next morning I woke
up, beautiful blue sky.

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:56.690 align:middle line:90%
I went, yahoo!

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:90%
It worked!

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I went out onto the beach,
put my towel out there.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was on a
little private beach.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.820 align:middle line:84%
We were in a private condo
complex, private beach.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Within an hour, all these people
were coming through the bushes

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.630 align:middle line:90%
onto my little beach.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:09.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, OK.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:90%
I'll share it with these people.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.270 align:middle line:84%
This newlywed couple
came up to me and went,

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.770 align:middle line:84%
we have driven around
this entire island.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.300 align:middle line:84%
It is pouring rain everywhere
except for this beach.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHING].

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: True story.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I could imagine.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: And you looked up,
and all you saw was blue sky.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And they went, we
don't understand it.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:90%
How can you only see blue sky?

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:90%
We were just out there.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.050 align:middle line:90%
It's raining.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's your reality, and
you're invited other people in.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:32.530 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.115 align:middle line:90%
That's very sharing of you.

00:45:34.115 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a look here
at this video where Pam is

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.180 align:middle line:90%
talking about the little dot.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a great story.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: So imagine
you're a dot.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.000 align:middle line:90%
You're a one-dimensional being.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.100 align:middle line:84%
That means basically that you're
a dot, a little flat dot on one

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.020 align:middle line:84%
line, and all you can
do is go back and forth

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.580 align:middle line:90%
on that one line.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.380 align:middle line:90%
That's your world, right?

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.473 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine you're a
two-dimensional being.

00:45:57.473 --> 00:45:58.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're a
two-dimensional being,

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.290 align:middle line:84%
you're a flat dot on
a flat piece of paper.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can go side to
side, back and forth,

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:07.890 align:middle line:84%
around in circles,
but you're a flat dot

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.500 align:middle line:84%
on that one piece of paper,
and that's your world.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.100 align:middle line:90%
That's all you can do.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:17.357 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine one day that a
little dot is really tired--

00:46:17.357 --> 00:46:18.690 align:middle line:90%
this is all of you, by the way--

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:21.535 align:middle line:84%
really tired of just being a
two-dimensional little being

00:46:21.535 --> 00:46:23.160 align:middle line:84%
stuck to that piece
of paper and that's

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.050 align:middle line:84%
all you can do-- back
and forth, side to side,

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:90%
around in circles.

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:26.670 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So one little dot one day
gets really bored with that

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.945 align:middle line:84%
and goes, there's gotta
be something else,

00:46:30.945 --> 00:46:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and musters all her strength
together and just believes

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.530 align:middle line:84%
this is possible and
leaps up into the air

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and comes back
down and goes, oh,

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:44.070 align:middle line:84%
my gosh and then does it
again and then does it

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.900 align:middle line:90%
again and goes, oh, my gosh.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.130 align:middle line:90%
There's something more.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:90%
There's a third dimension.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.630 align:middle line:84%
We're not just stuck to this
two-dimensional little flat

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.900 align:middle line:90%
piece of paper.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.460 align:middle line:90%
There's something more here.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.085 align:middle line:84%
And that little dot
gets really excited

00:46:56.085 --> 00:46:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and goes all the other little
dots and goes, hey, you guys,

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:59.770 align:middle line:84%
we're not stuck to
the piece of paper.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:01.187 align:middle line:84%
You can go into a
third dimension.

00:47:01.187 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And they'll go, get out of here.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You're crazy, crazy,
because all they've known

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.020 align:middle line:90%
is that flat piece of paper.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.620 align:middle line:90%
That's their entire world.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.160 align:middle line:84%
That's all they've known, so
they shun that little dot.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Little dot comes back
again-- no, you guys, really.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.455 align:middle line:90%
You really can do this.

00:47:14.455 --> 00:47:15.330 align:middle line:90%
I've jumped up there.

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I know there's
another dimension.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.535 align:middle line:84%
And they get so frustrated
with this little dot

00:47:19.535 --> 00:47:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that they send her off to
the far side of the paper

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.800 align:middle line:90%
and go, get out of here.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Leave us alone.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:24.960 align:middle line:90%
You're bugging us.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.760 align:middle line:90%
You're insane.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not careful,
we'll lock you up.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the little dot just keeps
jumping up and down on her own

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and goes, OK, I'll be in the
three dimension by myself.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, some
other little dots

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.700 align:middle line:90%
start believing her.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they also jump
up and go, oh, my gosh.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.360 align:middle line:10%
It's possible.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.020 align:middle line:90%
You really can do this.

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.360 align:middle line:90%
So then they start jumping up.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.190 align:middle line:10%
And of course, it upsets
all the rest of the two

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.065 align:middle line:10%
little dimensional
things-- like, oh my gosh,

00:47:49.065 --> 00:47:52.380 align:middle line:10%
we've got a bunch of kooky,
hippy, California weirdo,

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.140 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.145 align:middle line:84%
But the point is is
then more and more

00:47:58.145 --> 00:47:59.520 align:middle line:84%
of these little
dots start seeing

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.050 align:middle line:90%
there's a third dimension.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the point.

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:05.580 align:middle line:84%
We think that we're
three dimensional beings,

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:09.180 align:middle line:84%
so we're living in this little
three dimensional thing.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.610 align:middle line:84%
After a while, this
little dot jumps up

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and pauses and looks down
and goes, oh, my gosh.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just jumping
into a third dimension.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.700 align:middle line:90%
I am three dimensional.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I have height and weight
and inside and outside.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:10%
There is more to me.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to be doing today

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:31.320 align:middle line:84%
is noticing that you are not
just three dimensional beings.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.330 align:middle line:84%
You are
multi-dimensional beings,

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to have
experiences of going

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.120 align:middle line:90%
into these other dimensions.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:37.920 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You obviously have been
able to use this in your life.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And you've been on CNN
and Whoopi Goldberg's

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.100 align:middle line:84%
show and Ricki
Lake and "The Talk"

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and so many different shows
talking about aura colors.

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:53.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:55.740 align:middle line:90%
CNN, really?

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.230 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing-- on the news.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And you've been able to
create and manifest your work

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:05.520 align:middle line:84%
in the world and across all
sorts of different platforms.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Was that an intention
you specifically sent?

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Absolutely.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.552 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:49:10.552 --> 00:49:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I've got yellow in my
aura, too, and we yellows

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.250 align:middle line:84%
don't like being told what
to do, just so you know.

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.050 align:middle line:90%
We're pleasers.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:16.800 align:middle line:84%
We want everyone to
be happy and like us,

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.480 align:middle line:84%
but we don't like
being told what to do.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as someone told
me I couldn't do something,

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, watch
this, including myself.

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I would question it.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I manifested all
those things intentionally,

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.480 align:middle line:90%
specifically.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did?

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, I did.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Give us an
example of how it worked.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The CNN spot.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.505 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:49:37.505 --> 00:49:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: I don't remember
how the CNN one happened.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:41.230 align:middle line:90%
That was so long ago.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:42.700 align:middle line:90%
But "The View"--

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I adore Whoopi
Goldberg, another violet yellow.

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:48.618 align:middle line:84%
And I went, I'd like to be on
"The View" or George Noory.

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And people are like,
oh, no you can't

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.110 align:middle line:84%
get on George Norry,
"Coast to Coast."

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.020 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.772 align:middle line:84%
And I envisioned myself there,
let it be really simple.

00:49:57.772 --> 00:49:58.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't struggle against it.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go, oh,
you're dreaming.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Everyone says it's hard.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do that.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.815 align:middle line:84%
I just set the intention, did
the vision, and let it happen.

00:50:08.815 --> 00:50:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you do
anything physically,

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.320 align:middle line:84%
like pitch him your book or have
your publicist talk to them?

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: I didn't.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.550 align:middle line:90%
I had a publicist.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I hired a publicist.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But the publicist even went,
don't hold your breath.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:21.955 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHING].

00:50:21.955 --> 00:50:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is a perfect
example of other influences

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and interferences.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: But I don't
listen to that.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.250 align:middle line:84%
When I do that, I
go, OK, that's just

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:30.540 align:middle line:90%
a reflection of me doubting it.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.080 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:31.990 align:middle line:90%
I can overcome that.

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:33.660 align:middle line:90%
But Lisa, look at our past.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.360 align:middle line:84%
People used to believe
the world was flat.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.783 align:middle line:84%
And can you imagine the first
person that came back and went,

00:50:39.783 --> 00:50:40.700 align:middle line:90%
we just sailed around?

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It's round.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.000 align:middle line:90%
It's round.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.680 align:middle line:90%
People are going to go, no way.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I can see it right there.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.360 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.568 align:middle line:84%
And how could somebody be
on the other side the world

00:50:48.568 --> 00:50:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and not fall off?

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.850 align:middle line:90%
It sounds just as crazy.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Or flight-- it's
like, oh, my gosh.

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I still look at those
giant jumbo jets up there

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and go, how are they getting
those things up in the air?

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Every time I'm on one
of them, I think, my goodness.

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:04.480 align:middle line:90%
We're defying gravity here.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well,
because we understood

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.600 align:middle line:90%
the principle of aerodynamics.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But before that, it
looked impossible.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.640 align:middle line:90%
So I've studied quantum physics.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.050 align:middle line:90%
And I go, oh, my gosh.

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:16.160 align:middle line:84%
It says all of these
things are possible.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.913 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to go for it.

00:51:17.913 --> 00:51:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the
way you create.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So other dimensions--
is that the same thing

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:23.560 align:middle line:90%
as parallel realities?

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah,
parallel universes--

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:27.490 align:middle line:90%
it's just a different frequency.

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:30.310 align:middle line:90%
And people can go read my book.

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:31.330 align:middle line:90%
They can research it.

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:34.720 align:middle line:84%
They can go Google it,
parallel universes.

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.547 align:middle line:84%
It's also with people
who've crossed over.

00:51:37.547 --> 00:51:38.380 align:middle line:90%
They're still alive.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I talk to their
souls all the time.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:42.310 align:middle line:90%
We're infinite beings.

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:45.070 align:middle line:84%
They might not appear to
have a physical body anymore,

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:49.280 align:middle line:84%
but I've got enough evidence
that I can communicate

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.530 align:middle line:90%
with people on the other side.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I have hospice sending
me people because I've

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:57.370 align:middle line:84%
been so successful at being able
to communicate with lost loved

00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:01.710 align:middle line:84%
ones, and I've been doing
it for 34 years now.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So like anything,
it's a practice.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And you have involved yourself
in this practice for so long,

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.070 align:middle line:90%
you've become a master at it.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:11.030 align:middle line:90%
How do you teach us to do this?

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It's belief, you said
once, and it's awareness.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Number one that's
important is the willingness

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:19.470 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.010 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people--

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:22.000 align:middle line:90%
"help me see auras."

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.527 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are afraid
to go to this level.

00:52:24.527 --> 00:52:26.110 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid bad
things will happen,

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:27.568 align:middle line:84%
or they're afraid
they can't do it,

00:52:27.568 --> 00:52:30.160 align:middle line:84%
or they're afraid
they shouldn't do it

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.820 align:middle line:90%
because of their upbringing.

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So the first stage in opening
up your consciousness to all

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:38.827 align:middle line:84%
of this-- because once you start
opening this up, it's amazing.

00:52:38.827 --> 00:52:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've helped
doing search and rescue.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to find people
whose plane went down in Panama

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and knew exactly
who still survived

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.400 align:middle line:84%
because I was communicating
with her remotely.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So once you open up to this
expansion, it's amazing,

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:53.930 align:middle line:90%
but it's more loving.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:55.030 align:middle line:90%
It's more fun.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So the first stage is
a willingness to do it.

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:00.520 align:middle line:84%
The second stage is
believing it's possible

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and then basically
allowing yourself

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.200 align:middle line:84%
to be quiet enough
that you shift off

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.930 align:middle line:90%
the doubtful chattering mind.

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:10.690 align:middle line:84%
We've got so much
chatter going on now just

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:14.167 align:middle line:84%
with the internet and the
media and the phones and the--

00:53:14.167 --> 00:53:15.250 align:middle line:90%
chatter, chatter, chatter.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It's busy.

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.240 align:middle line:90%
So I intentionally get quiet.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you learn how to
get quiet, you can hear.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle line:90%
And then practice.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Practice getting quiet.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, so it's awareness.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:30.250 align:middle line:90%
It's getting quiet.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:31.888 align:middle line:90%
It's belief that you can do it.

00:53:31.888 --> 00:53:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's a
willingness to do it.

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Willingness,
and it's trust.

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's practicing
and trusting, especially

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.310 align:middle line:90%
if you do get something.

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.703 align:middle line:90%
Don't discount it.

00:53:40.703 --> 00:53:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, I picked that
up, even if it starts small.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We didn't start walking the
very first time we tried.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.123 align:middle line:84%
Everything we've learned
we've done with practice.

00:53:48.123 --> 00:53:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And don't
let it scare you

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:84%

we intuitively

We can use it to shift things.

And we can do it
from level one of,

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get out
there and help people,

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.255 align:middle line:84%
which then we have
the experience

00:54:50.255 --> 00:54:52.930 align:middle line:84%
of expressing ourselves
with compassion

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:55.130 align:middle line:90%
and humanitarian kindness.

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.302 align:middle line:90%
So we get that experience.

00:54:58.302 --> 00:55:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And people aren't going
to like me saying this,

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:04.130 align:middle line:84%
but I trust people's souls
know what they're doing.

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.310 align:middle line:84%

out there suffering

or in third world countries
and they're starving,

00:55:10.672 --> 00:55:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I think they volunteered to
do that, one, to see what

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.440 align:middle line:84%
the experience was
like, but, two,

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.710 align:middle line:84%
to give us an opportunity
to be compassionate.

We're playing movie
roles, and our souls

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.230 align:middle line:90%

I don't try to talk
people into this.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:38.490 align:middle line:90%

again, not getting
religious, but I

in different workshops.

01:00:25.228 --> 01:00:27.067 align:middle line:90%
So each group is different.

01:00:27.067 --> 01:00:27.900 align:middle line:90%
But it was so funny.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:31.750 align:middle line:84%
In that particular video, there
were two young kids in there,

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:32.550 align:middle line:90%
very young.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:33.943 align:middle line:90%
Their parents had brought them.

01:00:33.943 --> 01:00:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
do the spoon bending.

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Come on, let's get on with it.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.630 align:middle line:90%
So I moved it up.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And we just do a meditation.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
You understand that you
feel that it's energy.

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.878 align:middle line:84%
You feel that it's soft and
liquid, not a solid thing.

01:00:44.878 --> 01:00:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that, it's
really easy to bend it

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:50.490 align:middle line:84%
when you think it's just a
piece of rubber or it's liquid.

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you just do.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.875 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's just, for
me, everything I do now,

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.370 align:middle line:84%
anything I teach, has
to do with showing--

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is teaching expanded
consciousness,

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
is getting us out of our
old limited thinking.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Because first of
all, it's boring.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, it's
causing a lot of suffering.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm on the
planet in this lifetime

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.728 align:middle line:84%
to help shift that
consciousness.

01:01:18.728 --> 01:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the only
one that's doing this.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Which is great.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.400 align:middle line:90%
We need a team.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.210 align:middle line:90%
We need a whole tribe.

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you
have a cold coming on,

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
do you shift into another
state of consciousness

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.730 align:middle line:90%
and it goes away?

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah.

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.035 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you have
a job that got lost,

01:01:34.035 --> 01:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
you shift into another
state of consciousness

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%
and make up another possibility?

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: I do that.

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Or I play with it.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I go-- like if a
client was supposed to call

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't call in, I
go, I could go, oh, my gosh,

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:47.760 align:middle line:90%
I can't even--

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.177 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, you
know what, good,

01:01:49.177 --> 01:01:50.385 align:middle line:90%
that gives me some free time.

01:01:50.385 --> 01:01:51.540 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes I go with it.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.023 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh, I manifested
some free time.

01:01:54.023 --> 01:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I really didn't want
to talk to someone right now.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go out and sit
in the sun for a little bit

01:01:58.210 --> 01:01:59.210 align:middle line:90%
or something.

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So if I've created
something, I'll

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
go, no, am I going to use
that for the positive,

01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and go have fun with it and
trust I did it for a reason.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.172 align:middle line:84%
Or do I want to create
a different reality?

01:02:09.172 --> 01:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you've touched
on this just a little bit.

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But what is your biggest
why, with everything

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:15.430 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing?

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:16.980 align:middle line:90%
What is Pam's biggest why?

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.212 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: My biggest why
that I used to have,

01:02:19.212 --> 01:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like I've answered
it, is what we're doing here.

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Why we're on the planet and what
this life experience is about.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm comfortable with
my answer for that now.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
My biggest why that
I struggle with still

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
is why don't I stay in levels
2, 3 and 4 all the time?

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Because I find myself--

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.520 align:middle line:84%
because it's very easy to
get sucked back into level 1.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And I go, uh, like,
I know better,

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:44.080 align:middle line:90%
I know 2 and 3 are real.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I had so much training in
level 1 thinking that sometimes

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I go, OK, you're
back in 1 because you

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.700 align:middle line:84%
want to experience it,
or don't beat yourself up

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
because that'll
just keep you there.

01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's what we're taught.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: But my
biggest struggle why

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:02.020 align:middle line:84%
is why don't I stay in
levels 2 and 3 more often.

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so we barely
touched on 4 and 5,

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
by the way, which is
the miracle zone, which

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
is the miraculous, the
enlightened zone, which is also

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.860 align:middle line:90%
obtainable.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
We've all had experiences
of level 1, 2, and 3.

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:19.055 align:middle line:84%
The thought and the work towards
it, then the ability for it

01:03:19.055 --> 01:03:21.180 align:middle line:84%
to show up at your door
and then the ability for it

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.180 align:middle line:90%
to show up in your hand.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:26.955 align:middle line:84%
But 4 and 5 is that
leap, that quantum leap.

01:03:26.955 --> 01:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, 4 is it
shows up in your hand.

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
3 is when it shows
up in the freezer.

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, right.

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:33.652 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's already there but
you don't remember buying it.

01:03:33.652 --> 01:03:35.100 align:middle line:10%
4 is in the hand.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.240 align:middle line:10%
And I haven't gotten there yet.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.260 align:middle line:10%
And when I ask myself why, I
go, am I afraid to do that?

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.020 align:middle line:10%
No, my biggest thing is, I don't
know if I'm powerful enough

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:44.820 align:middle line:10%
to do that yet.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
My level of beliefs
haven't attained

01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that level of frequency
yet, that power yet.

01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then level
5 is you're one with it.

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: You're one with it.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.865 align:middle line:90%
And we've all been there.

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, we have.

01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: We come from that.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's like we came
here for the experience.

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:00.225 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, we have.

01:04:00.225 --> 01:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: We came here to be able
to experience compassion, love,

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:04.860 align:middle line:84%
walking on the beach,
tasting ice cream,

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.920 align:middle line:90%
being on the carousel.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, I encourage you to
take this conversation

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and expand it in your own
life, in your own world.

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Find out where you play in
level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and start

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
to experiment, just
as Pam is doing.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for sharing
the levels of manifestation

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.600 align:middle line:90%
with us.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to try this myself.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: I know.

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people, argue
for your limitations

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and they're yours.

01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to try and tell
people, you have to do this.

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling
you it's possible.

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So thanks for letting me
talk about this, Lisa.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.085 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

01:04:33.085 --> 01:04:33.885 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

01:04:33.885 --> 01:04:36.075 align:middle line:10%
This conversation just
leapt out in time.

01:04:36.075 --> 01:04:36.950 align:middle line:10%
So thank you so much.

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:37.868 align:middle line:10%
I appreciate it.

01:04:37.868 --> 01:04:40.410 align:middle line:10%
And thank you for sharing this
conversation with me, as well.
