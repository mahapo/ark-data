00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:14.315 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.217 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
learn how to clear

00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:18.386 align:middle line:84%
a negative thought
in just minutes?

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:20.187 align:middle line:84%
Or would you like to
learn how to change

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.623 align:middle line:90%
your language in 21 days?

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:25.092 align:middle line:84%
Well, get ready do some
exercises in this show,

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.795 align:middle line:84%
and be ready to learn,
because joining me today

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.164 align:middle line:84%
is a very well-respected
communications

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:32.266 align:middle line:90%
expert, Dr. Yvonne Oswald.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:37.371 align:middle line:84%
She pays very careful attention
to her words and her thoughts,

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.274 align:middle line:84%
thus the title of her book,
"Every Word Has Power."

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:41.208 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.576 align:middle line:84%
>>YVONNE OSWALD:
Thank you, Lisa.

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:43.511 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:44.578 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I'm so
glad you're here.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I know.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.782 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we get to do
some exercises on this show.

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:48.783 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: OK.

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you have
this unique ability

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.587 align:middle line:84%
to combine hypnotherapy and
neurolinguistic programming.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:54.655 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.157 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you come
up with that concept?

00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:58.659 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: What happened was I
started-- I did plenty of work

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.261 align:middle line:84%
on myself because I had
an interesting childhood,

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:00.828 align:middle line:90%
shall we say.

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:01.896 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:04.465 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, wait, you
cannot just say that.

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.033 align:middle line:84%
What was the
interesting childhood?

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.501 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: The
interesting childhood

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.571 align:middle line:84%
was abuse from my
father for three years.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.373 align:middle line:90%
And then my sister died.

00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:14.442 align:middle line:84%
And he told me he wished
I'd died instead of her.

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:15.543 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:17.511 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: So through my
teens, through my 20s,

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.013 align:middle line:84%
I knew something
wasn't quite right.

00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:20.281 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't catch on.

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.515 align:middle line:84%
And then as I came into my
30s, I thought, you know what?

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.819 align:middle line:84%
I need to start doing
some work on myself.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And I did talk therapy.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.854 align:middle line:90%
And I did Gestalt.

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:28.422 align:middle line:90%
And I did scream therapy.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:29.289 align:middle line:90%
And I did rebirthing.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.925 align:middle line:90%
You name, I did it.

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:32.993 align:middle line:90%
And then I discovered hypnosis.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.728 align:middle line:84%
And I took a little
certification program,

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:90%
a little three days.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.132 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I have to
learn everything about this.

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:40.401 align:middle line:90%
It's so sweet, so easy.

00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.837 align:middle line:84%
And I went on to
take my PhD in it.

00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:43.904 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, that's good.

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe that hypnosis
and anything that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.211 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
subconscious is the only way

00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.847 align:middle line:84%
to effectively have
lasting change.

00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:54.715 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to get
to the deep programs.

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:55.783 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: You do.

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.852 align:middle line:84%
And all change and all
learning is unconscious.

00:01:57.852 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're setting
up the bridge again

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.122 align:middle line:84%
between your conscious mind
and your unconscious mind

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.491 align:middle line:90%
to make that program change.

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:06.193 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the NLP
is fantastic for that.

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.963 align:middle line:84%
The NLP simply deletes the
files, deletes the files.

00:02:08.963 --> 00:02:09.964 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Does it really?

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:11.499 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It really does.

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing lot
of work recently

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.437 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of suicidal
people, and a lot of cutters,

00:02:16.437 --> 00:02:17.938 align:middle line:90%
teenagers particularly.

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:18.973 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:20.875 align:middle line:84%
Three hours of post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:22.009 align:middle line:90%
it will be gone.

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.643 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:23.644 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yep.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:24.745 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that you
could see instantly?

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:26.347 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Instantly.

00:02:26.347 --> 00:02:27.781 align:middle line:84%
I get people to
send me three pages

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:29.283 align:middle line:84%
of what's not working
in their life.

00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:31.685 align:middle line:84%
And I read back at the end
of it, what about this?

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:32.753 align:middle line:90%
Do you still believe that?

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.054 align:middle line:90%
And they go, I didn't say that.

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:35.723 align:middle line:90%
Did I really say that?

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.892 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: And it's that quick.

00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:38.626 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:39.727 align:middle line:90%
I love that, though.

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:40.594 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're really
helping a lot of people.

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:41.929 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Oh, it's wonderful.

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.329 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's
talk a little bit

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.468 align:middle line:84%
about the foundational process
here that you discovered

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:50.538 align:middle line:90%
through Raymond Birdwhistell?

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:51.539 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.073 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who was he?

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:54.275 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: He was a professor.

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:56.744 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
discovered-- he did a study.

00:02:56.744 --> 00:03:01.015 align:middle line:84%
And he said that 55% of our
communication is body language.

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:03.851 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important,
when someone's saying,

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.786 align:middle line:84%
oh, I love this,
and they're shaking

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:09.023 align:middle line:84%
their head the not right way,
you will believe automatically

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:11.458 align:middle line:84%
the body language
over the words.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.861 align:middle line:90%
38% is the tonality you use.

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:15.996 align:middle line:90%
And then only 7% is the words.

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:19.033 align:middle line:84%
However, the words are
really, really important.

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:22.903 align:middle line:84%
Because 20% of those words,
those key words we use,

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:24.471 align:middle line:90%
have emotional weight.

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:26.473 align:middle line:84%
And the unconscious
mind is programmed

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.742 align:middle line:84%
to search for and
produce emotions

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:30.344 align:middle line:90%
to let you know if you're safe.

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:33.914 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So 55% is
the body language.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:34.515 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:35.482 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.817 align:middle line:84%
then the rest is
basically the tonality.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:40.588 align:middle line:84%
And then a small
percentage are the words.

00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:43.057 align:middle line:84%
But yet the 7% of
the verbal words

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.159 align:middle line:90%
that you say impact you 100%.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.726 align:middle line:90%
Don't they?

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.727 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.696 align:middle line:84%
Because your self talk
literally produces

00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:50.297 align:middle line:84%
100% of the results
in your life,

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:52.031 align:middle line:90%
whether it's good or not good.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.368 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these aren't
necessarily the words you say.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:55.202 align:middle line:90%
It's the thoughts you think.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:56.203 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yes,
it's the thoughts.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:57.404 align:middle line:84%
And it's the intent
behind the thoughts.

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.206 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
low energy words,

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:02.343 align:middle line:84%
if you think low energy
words, such as bad, problem,

00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
difficult, hard, what happens is
you're using your limbic brain.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.648 align:middle line:84%
And that limbic
brain is directly

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:08.816 align:middle line:90%
in touch with your amygdala.

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:11.752 align:middle line:84%
So you're in touch with the
fight or flight response.

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:14.922 align:middle line:84%
When you use high energy words
like excitement, joy, freedom,

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:17.891 align:middle line:84%
happiness, you're using
your prefrontal cortex.

00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:21.428 align:middle line:84%
And that has no access
to the lower brain, which

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.564 align:middle line:84%
means that you're feeling
good all the time.

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:27.167 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So let's talk about a
perfect example, weight loss.

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.135 align:middle line:90%
Why so many people--

00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:28.869 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Weight release.

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Weight release, OK.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.704 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Because
anything you lose,

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.539 align:middle line:84%
you go finding
again, like our keys.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.842 align:middle line:90%
So we say weight release.

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how about
permanent weight change?

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.046 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Permanent weight
change is really interesting.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.748 align:middle line:84%
Because what people
don't do-- when

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:42.616 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with someone
with weight release,

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.219 align:middle line:84%
I always say to them, you
need to cleanse first.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Number one job is
you need to cleanse.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.923 align:middle line:84%
If you have any belly fat at
all, it says you're toxic.

00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:52.693 align:middle line:84%
And the second I see someone
with a belly, I'm like,

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:54.061 align:middle line:90%
you need to see me once.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:56.897 align:middle line:84%
And then next time, I want
to see this belly fat gone.

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.399 align:middle line:84%
The belly fat's
there for protection

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.668 align:middle line:90%
of all the toxins in your body.

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:01.735 align:middle line:90%
So I know it's not--

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.003 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It holds on to
the toxins, too, yeah.

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:04.838 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It holds on to the
toxins as a protective device.

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.241 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not healthy for
you to have that going around

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.275 align:middle line:90%
your body.

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:11.278 align:middle line:84%
And I make sure they
have a liver cleanse.

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:13.547 align:middle line:84%
And they sometimes do
the master cleanse.

00:05:13.547 --> 00:05:15.516 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll see them.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:18.319 align:middle line:84%
Because every major
religion has cleansing

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.122 align:middle line:84%
involved in the whole ritual--
40 days of Lent, et cetera.

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.191 align:middle line:90%
And we don't do it these days.

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.428 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you think that
when you hold on to toxins

00:05:27.428 --> 00:05:30.464 align:middle line:84%
and to excess body
fat, that it's also

00:05:30.464 --> 00:05:32.533 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts, the
excess thoughts?

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Definitely, yes.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.034 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's all connected?

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's all connected.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.539 align:middle line:84%
And it's all done before
you're seven years old.

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.174 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is, you

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.475 align:middle line:84%
don't know what you
thought before you

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:41.942 align:middle line:90%
were seven years old.

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:42.943 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:45.446 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: You have
no way of remembering

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.481 align:middle line:90%
what decisions you made.

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.983 align:middle line:84%
And you made those decisions
with this much information

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:51.018 align:middle line:90%
available, remember.

00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:53.554 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, no
critical thinking factors.

00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.522 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: There's
no filter at all.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.624 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is you live your life

00:05:57.624 --> 00:05:59.993 align:middle line:84%
based on those
little assumptions.

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:03.564 align:middle line:84%
How you know they're there is
very much like quantum physics.

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.065 align:middle line:90%
You can see the leaves moving.

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:07.534 align:middle line:90%
You know there must be a breeze.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:11.238 align:middle line:84%
With the words, you know there's
something not working for you.

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Because there's something
not working in your life,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.075 align:middle line:84%
you know you've made
a limiting decision.

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:17.745 align:middle line:84%
So if you want $1 million and
you haven't got $1 million,

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:19.213 align:middle line:90%
you've made a limiting decision.

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.648 align:middle line:84%
If you want health,
and your not healthy,

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:23.617 align:middle line:84%
you've made a
decision somewhere.

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:25.219 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
easy to find them.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.488 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So then can you
reverse that and actually make

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:29.089 align:middle line:90%
the decision to be healthy?

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.857 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: 100%.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:30.957 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Make the decision to--

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:31.992 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Unconsciously.

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.026 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Unconsciously.

00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:35.429 align:middle line:84%
So make the decision
to break the pattern,

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:38.499 align:middle line:84%
but embed a new pattern
of healthy food.

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.267 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, and not even.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:41.935 align:middle line:84%
Once you've released
those emotions.

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:43.771 align:middle line:84%
Because, obviously,
weight release

00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:45.506 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
holding on to stuff.

00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:47.641 align:middle line:84%
Stuff is like the
technical word for it.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:50.978 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is you
have those decisions

00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:52.446 align:middle line:84%
like little clouds
above your head.

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:55.048 align:middle line:84%
So when you send up a thought to
the abundant universe and say,

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:57.683 align:middle line:84%
I want this please, if
those clouds are there,

00:06:57.683 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
then it can't find
its way there.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.356 align:middle line:84%
Or it finds its way there, and
it can't find its way back.

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:03.824 align:middle line:84%
If you get excited
about something,

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.593 align:middle line:84%
you get interested in
going towards something,

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:10.597 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly, Bob's your
uncle, it comes back to you.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:13.634 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you have to go
into a hypnotic state in order

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:15.469 align:middle line:90%
for this change to be effective?

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:17.805 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: You can do it
with NLP linguistically.

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:18.472 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can?

00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:19.439 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: You can, yes.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.441 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really interesting.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.278 align:middle line:84%
There's a mathematical equation
called a Cartesian coordinate,

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.713 align:middle line:84%
which is what would happen if
you did release weight, what

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:28.549 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't happen if you did
release weight, what would

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.617 align:middle line:84%
happen if you didn't release
weight, what wouldn't happen

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.019 align:middle line:90%
if you didn't release weight.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:34.288 align:middle line:90%
And it opens up possibilities.

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:36.423 align:middle line:84%
Instead of people searching
over and over again

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:39.726 align:middle line:84%
for those little seven bits
of information out of the two

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:42.329 align:middle line:84%
million that the
unconscious is aware of,

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:45.465 align:middle line:84%
it opens up the unconscious so
that it can get new solutions.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.501 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've heard of the
Cartesian coordinates--

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:48.435 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's amazing.

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:49.903 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the four
segments, and you

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:53.006 align:middle line:84%
can convince the
unconscious-- that

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:54.374 align:middle line:90%
unravels the unconscious mind.

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:55.275 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It does.

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:56.409 align:middle line:84%
It loosens the
model of the world.

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:57.978 align:middle line:84%
And once you've
loosened the model,

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.646 align:middle line:90%
you have every possibility.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.647 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.082 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Causes confusion, too.

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:03.417 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It does.

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:05.686 align:middle line:84%
You know, most people when they
get caught up in this closed

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:09.189 align:middle line:84%
loop, it's looking for a door in
a closed room, in a dark room.

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:11.758 align:middle line:84%
And you can go round, and round,
and round, and never find it.

00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
You only need one
flash of lightning

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.962 align:middle line:90%
to show you where the door is.

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And, suddenly, there
you are at the door.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.999 align:middle line:84%
And you can open it, even
when it's dark again.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.468 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And sometimes when
you have confusion, just

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:25.906 align:middle line:84%
like the chaos theory, the mind
attempts to chunk itself up

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.608 align:middle line:84%
to the highest possible
sense of order.

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:28.775 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: That's right, yes.

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.577 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then resolves
itself if it can.

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:33.347 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Exactly, goes
up to highest values.

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:34.948 align:middle line:84%
And then brings
you new solutions.

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The chaos
theory to undo it.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.885 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:39.586 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, well, if you were to
work with someone on something

00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:40.354 align:middle line:90%
like weight loss.

00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:41.388 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Weight release.

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:44.258 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Weight
release, thank you.

00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:46.927 align:middle line:84%
Would you have to know-- and I
appreciate your attentiveness

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:48.328 align:middle line:90%
to my words.

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:50.497 align:middle line:84%
Would you have to know the
person's story around it?

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:51.498 align:middle line:90%
Would you undo that?

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:52.766 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: That's an
interesting idea.

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.234 align:middle line:84%
Because what used
to happen is when

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.536 align:middle line:84%
I'd do a session with someone,
I'd get the whole story.

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.472 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be sitting there
taking notes, thinking

00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:90%
this is really not interesting.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.341 align:middle line:90%
And then I said to one person.

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, to save us
time-- and me time,

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.546 align:middle line:84%
and you money-- send me
three pages ahead of time.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.515 align:middle line:90%
Send me a story.

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:10.751 align:middle line:84%
And they would actually
write three to ten pages.

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:13.053 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly it's like,
oh, I know you so well.

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.155 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
thinking of me all the time.

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:17.257 align:middle line:84%
And, literally, I would
spend the first hour

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:20.994 align:middle line:84%
on that story just
deleting the files.

00:09:20.994 --> 00:09:23.564 align:middle line:84%
Very simple, when we've deleted
the files, when we have them

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:26.199 align:middle line:84%
in that state where they're
not sure where they're going

00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:28.001 align:middle line:84%
or who they are
anymore, suddenly

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:29.469 align:middle line:84%
then we can actually
get to where

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:31.672 align:middle line:84%
we want to go and really
set them on a new path.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:32.773 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:32.773 --> 00:09:35.776 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a wonderful
commitment to words.

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:41.348 align:middle line:84%
And I have a video here of you
changing somebody's pattern

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:42.549 align:middle line:90%
into optimistic thinking.

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:43.884 align:middle line:90%
Now, take a look at this video.

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:46.353 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do this
exercise along with Dr. Yvonne.

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:48.088 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.756 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Hello,
Dr. Yvonne here.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Every word has power.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk today
about optimistic thinking.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.096 align:middle line:90%
How do you get optimistic?

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.532 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about optimism.

00:09:58.532 --> 00:10:01.702 align:middle line:84%
You know, you show optimism
in your physiology as well.

00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
You can show it with
your body language.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.206 align:middle line:84%
And you can change your mind
by changing your physiology.

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:07.541 align:middle line:90%
Quite amazing.

00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:84%
When someone's down,
literally, what happens

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.311 align:middle line:90%
is their head is down.

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:12.646 align:middle line:90%
Their shoulders are down.

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.147 align:middle line:90%
They're slumped.

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:16.216 align:middle line:84%
And their breathing
becomes very shallow.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:19.987 align:middle line:84%
And you can see from their
face, it doesn't look great.

00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:21.054 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:23.156 align:middle line:84%
Because even as
I'm down here, I'm

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:25.425 align:middle line:90%
not feeling very good right now.

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:28.061 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you
a better physiology.

00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:31.164 align:middle line:84%
Chin up, back
straight, feeling good.

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:34.835 align:middle line:84%
Nice, deep breaths, remember
that the deep breath relaxes

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:37.804 align:middle line:84%
the diaphragm, tells the
unconscious mind, we're safe.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.506 align:middle line:90%
Everything's cool.

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:42.309 align:middle line:84%
And just simply by staying
physiologically upright,

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:90%
you actually feel a lot better.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.277 align:middle line:90%
I feel great now, actually.

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:45.579 align:middle line:90%
I feel really good.

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:48.115 align:middle line:84%
And funnily enough, I'm starting
to remember beautiful times

00:10:48.115 --> 00:10:48.982 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:51.251 align:middle line:84%
You start to
remember sunny days.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead
and get you anchored

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.256 align:middle line:84%
into a beautiful
time in your past.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to simply put
your chin up, back straight.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.595 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:03.597 align:middle line:84%
And think of the
most amazing time

00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:84%
you ever had in your whole
life, a beautiful day when

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.504 align:middle line:84%
you were calmly at the
beach or in a forest,

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.539 align:middle line:84%
listening to the
sounds of nature.

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:13.673 align:middle line:90%
Turn all the colors up.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:14.574 align:middle line:90%
Turn the sounds up.

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:16.343 align:middle line:90%
Turn the feelings up.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.445 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you,
actually, to find out

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:21.548 align:middle line:84%
where you're holding that
memory in your physical body.

00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:26.286 align:middle line:84%
I have a memory of
the beach, right here.

00:11:26.286 --> 00:11:28.789 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why it's there.

00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:31.358 align:middle line:84%
My unconscious mind
knows why it's there.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:34.528 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually going to plant
that memory of the beach right

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:35.862 align:middle line:90%
here on my shoulder.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.898 align:middle line:84%
And every time I think
of my right shoulder,

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be thinking of
the beach and relaxation.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.904 align:middle line:84%
I can even touch that area and
find that I will immediately

00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:45.772 align:middle line:90%
become optimistic.

00:11:45.772 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions are stored
in your physical body.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.077 align:middle line:84%
That's the only place your
unconscious mind knows

00:11:50.077 --> 00:11:52.779 align:middle line:84%
where to store your
emotions and your memories.

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:55.148 align:middle line:84%
The memories have emotions
associated with them.

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:58.518 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually plant new
memories in our physical body

00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:00.187 align:middle line:84%
and release the
old memories, too.

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We can do mind magic from the
book "Every Word Has Power"

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.892 align:middle line:90%
to clear the negative emotions.

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.528 align:middle line:84%
To really gets
into optimism, it's

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:12.199 align:middle line:84%
as simple as sitting up
straight, back straight.

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:14.568 align:middle line:84%
Going into Hakalau, going
into the learning state, where

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:16.703 align:middle line:84%
you see the left and
the right on both sides.

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:18.839 align:middle line:84%
And touching that
beautiful memory.

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.808 align:middle line:84%
Deep breath, feeling
good for the day.

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:23.543 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, this is Dr. Yvonne.

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:25.846 align:middle line:84%
It was great being
with you today.

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:28.181 align:middle line:84%
Pass along my tips to
everybody you know.

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:30.417 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking forward
to seeing you next time.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.785 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:33.153 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so
that was the first

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:35.489 align:middle line:84%
of a couple of videos where
we can actually do exercises

00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:37.090 align:middle line:90%
with you, which I love.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.227 align:middle line:84%
So you talk about what
you call the happy brain.

00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:42.229 align:middle line:84%
Is that where the
programming is going into?

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:43.363 align:middle line:90%
What is the happy brain?

00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.332 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: The happy brain
is the prefrontal cortex.

00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:46.366 align:middle line:90%
It's up here.

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:48.902 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is when
you sit up straight,

00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:51.805 align:middle line:84%
when you put your chin up,
when you go into Hakalau,

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
you're actually using
the prefrontal cortex.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.209 align:middle line:84%
It then has no access
to the amygdala.

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:59.412 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're consciously
using the prefrontal cortex.

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.082 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The limbic
system of the brain

00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:03.717 align:middle line:84%
is where the old
storage is, right?

00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:05.852 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: That's right,
the old family brain.

00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:07.254 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The survival
brain, right?

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:08.321 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.924 align:middle line:84%
And language is only
about 65,000 years old.

00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:12.025 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a long time.

00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.293 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's not.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.595 align:middle line:84%
In the broader scheme of things,
it's really not that long.

00:13:15.595 --> 00:13:16.897 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:18.965 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In my lifetime,
it's a really long time.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:19.466 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly, I know.

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.435 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so let's
undo some words here,

00:13:22.435 --> 00:13:25.705 align:middle line:84%
or find some alternatives
to certain words.

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:28.208 align:middle line:90%
So for example, failure.

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.877 align:middle line:84%
When I failed at
something, what could we

00:13:30.877 --> 00:13:33.547 align:middle line:84%
switch it to instead
of the word failure?

00:13:33.547 --> 00:13:36.183 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I didn't have
enough information.

00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:38.084 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I didn't get
enough information.

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So instead of I failed
that test, I didn't get--

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.289 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Exactly, I didn't
have enough information.

00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:43.757 align:middle line:84%
Or I didn't know
my stuff enough.

00:13:43.757 --> 00:13:46.526 align:middle line:84%
See, when a child
falls down, you

00:13:46.526 --> 00:13:48.395 align:middle line:84%
don't stand there and
go, aw, look at that.

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:50.797 align:middle line:84%
You stand there and
say, hey, you can do it.

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:51.698 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:53.333 align:middle line:84%
And then the child
stands and walks.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.868 align:middle line:90%
And then falls down again.

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:56.336 align:middle line:90%
And you don't say, aw.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:57.604 align:middle line:90%
You actually say, it's OK.

00:13:57.604 --> 00:13:58.939 align:middle line:90%
You'll do it next time.

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:01.841 align:middle line:84%
So it's just when you don't do--
if this person does something

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
great, and I don't
do something great,

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.245 align:middle line:84%
it means I don't have
enough information.

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.482 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, I mean, what, for
example of running for office?

00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
When a person doesn't win,
or a contest or something,

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.656 align:middle line:84%
can you turn that into a
learning experience with that?

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:18.792 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying I
failed, I learned--

00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:19.459 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:20.093 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:21.228 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's OK.

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:22.395 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, and, of
course, I learned more.

00:14:22.395 --> 00:14:23.697 align:middle line:90%
I learned about myself.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:25.532 align:middle line:84%
I learned what I
need to know more

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:28.034 align:middle line:90%
about what I was aiming towards.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.402 align:middle line:90%
Did I appeal to highest values?

00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:33.406 align:middle line:84%
Did I help the people
understand my message?

00:14:33.406 --> 00:14:34.908 align:middle line:84%
Because the meaning
of communication

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:36.576 align:middle line:90%
is it's a response you get.

00:14:36.576 --> 00:14:38.245 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get
the right response,

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
then you're not communicating
your point well enough.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.015 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting,
very interesting.

00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:43.683 align:middle line:84%
It'd be good to
know before you run

00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:45.018 align:middle line:90%
for that office or contest--

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:46.353 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:14:46.353 --> 00:14:48.455 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is to do your speech,
or your whatever you're doing,

00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:50.257 align:middle line:84%
with the meaning
associated with it.

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:51.958 align:middle line:84%
And make sure that
that drives home.

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And you need to do it in the
format of why am I doing this?

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.064 align:middle line:90%
What is it about?

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
go about doing it?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.336 align:middle line:84%
And does anybody
have any questions?

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:05.705 align:middle line:84%
If you simply apply that
to everything you say,

00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:08.408 align:middle line:84%
speak, or write, you've got
the way the brain works.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.876 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Think about
job interviews.

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:11.244 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.679 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: People are always trying
to figure out how do I get this

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:13.947 align:middle line:84%
job over the millions
of applicants, and--

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:14.914 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.283 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And if you
can actually come in

00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:19.819 align:middle line:84%
with your intentionality, it'll
go through to the employer.

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:22.355 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, and match or
mirror the people employing.

00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:24.357 align:middle line:84%
If you've got three
people interviewing you,

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and one of them is mismatching
your body language,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.497 align:middle line:84%
your job is to talk to
the ones who love you,

00:15:30.497 --> 00:15:32.966 align:middle line:84%
and match the body language
of the person who doesn't.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:35.802 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually bring
them into the club.

00:15:35.802 --> 00:15:37.037 align:middle line:90%
It's so cool when you do that.

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:37.904 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:39.539 align:middle line:84%
So two people
could be receptive.

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
One could have
their arms closed.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.642 align:middle line:84%
So if they've got
their arms closed,

00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:44.144 align:middle line:84%
you would sit there
with your hands

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:45.512 align:middle line:90%
closed on your lap like that.

00:15:45.512 --> 00:15:47.614 align:middle line:84%
Not like this, obviously
not copying them directly,

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:48.581 align:middle line:90%
but matching them.

00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:50.583 align:middle line:84%
And then as you're
talking to the two,

00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:52.185 align:middle line:84%
you will then bring
in the third one.

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:54.387 align:middle line:84%
Say, and this--
and bring them in.

00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:56.289 align:middle line:90%
They have to open their hands.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.557 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting to do.

00:15:57.557 --> 00:15:58.558 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fascinating.

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:00.226 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: They absolutely
have no option.

00:16:00.226 --> 00:16:02.996 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, they
want to keep them closed.

00:16:02.996 --> 00:16:04.597 align:middle line:84%
And you've brought
them into the club.

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:06.199 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's
how you're basically

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:08.735 align:middle line:84%
using neurolinguistic
programming hypnotically.

00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:09.736 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:11.137 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By matching
and mirroring them.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:13.139 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, and in hypnosis
it's called pacing and leading.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.541 align:middle line:84%
You join them all
over the world,

00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:16.076 align:middle line:84%
and then bring them
into yours, which

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%
is what all therapy is about.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.412 align:middle line:84%
When I do work
with people, to me,

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.047 align:middle line:84%
all therapy is a
parts integration.

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:22.716 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing
the bits back home

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:24.451 align:middle line:90%
that were separated off somehow.

00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:25.151 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:25.985 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.355 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's reframe
the word "lazy."

00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:29.622 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:30.957 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I'm relaxing.

00:16:30.957 --> 00:16:31.424 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:34.027 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:16:34.027 --> 00:16:36.062 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want to
sit down and do nothing

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:38.832 align:middle line:84%
if your unconscious mind
wasn't saying, I need a rest.

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about bored?

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.201 align:middle line:90%
Can you reframe bored?

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:42.669 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I'm not
very interested.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.037 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not interested.

00:16:44.037 --> 00:16:45.271 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:47.307 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: So the unconscious
mind doesn't hear the not.

00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:50.777 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, if you, don't
touch that to a five-year-old,

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:52.312 align:middle line:84%
the five-year-old's
going to do this.

00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:53.546 align:middle line:90%
And you say, don't touch that.

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:54.647 align:middle line:90%
And it goes, yeah.

00:16:54.647 --> 00:16:56.249 align:middle line:90%
Because it hears the word touch.

00:16:56.249 --> 00:16:57.784 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't hear grammar.

00:16:57.784 --> 00:16:59.519 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't compute grammar.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't understand context.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.422 align:middle line:90%
It computes keywords.

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:04.758 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just like the internet
search, basically, right?

00:17:04.758 --> 00:17:06.393 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yes, exactly, just
like an internet search,

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.361 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when
you say don't, it

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.063 align:middle line:84%
deletes the don't, and
just hears the keyword.

00:17:10.063 --> 00:17:10.997 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:12.198 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so if you're
a parent, the word

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:15.167 align:middle line:84%
don't needs never to
come out of your mouth.

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.103 align:middle line:84%
Because what follows is
it is exactly what you

00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:17.737 align:middle line:90%
don't want them to do.

00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:18.938 align:middle line:90%
And they'll do it.

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:21.775 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Go back to the
concept every word has power.

00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:23.108 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, so
body, how could you

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.883 align:middle line:90%
reframe your body image?

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:33.653 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Just about saying I
feel slim and beautiful today.

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.188 align:middle line:84%
And the unconscious
mind is searching

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:38.291 align:middle line:84%
for slim and beautiful, and
will bring you more of the same.

00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:38.925 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:40.026 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:40.994 align:middle line:90%
Bad.

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:42.595 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Not good.

00:17:42.595 --> 00:17:43.863 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I did a not good job?

00:17:43.863 --> 00:17:44.864 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I didn't do a good Job

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:46.232 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I didn't do a good job.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.635 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I actually have
worked so much with these words,

00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:49.736 align:middle line:90%
it's really interesting.

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:52.172 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching at the
Harvard Medical School.

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:54.507 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so,
the word not good.

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:55.809 align:middle line:90%
The word not good.

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:57.977 align:middle line:84%
And I literally didn't
have that word in my head.

00:17:57.977 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I had to ask someone
what word not good was.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.381 align:middle line:90%
And they said, bad.

00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:03.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, ah, that one, yes.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.219 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- when you actually
start working with them.

00:18:06.219 --> 00:18:08.121 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been
doing it for years now.

00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:10.223 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
access to those words.

00:18:10.223 --> 00:18:12.058 align:middle line:84%
Or here's the
interesting thing, you

00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:14.627 align:middle line:84%
don't have access
the concepts either.

00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:16.996 align:middle line:84%
So, theoretically, according
to quantum mechanics,

00:18:16.996 --> 00:18:19.632 align:middle line:84%
what we don't observe
doesn't exist.

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:21.868 align:middle line:84%
If we can release the word
"hate" from our language,

00:18:21.868 --> 00:18:23.403 align:middle line:84%
then the whole
concept will exist.

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:25.238 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what's
another word for hate?

00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:26.206 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I don't like.

00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:27.273 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't like.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.209 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: We say, I
hate that TV show.

00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:30.343 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:31.778 align:middle line:84%
The unconscious mind isn't
searching for TV show;

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.646 align:middle line:84%
it's searching for the
emotional word, which

00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:37.584 align:middle line:84%
is where this job is to give
you emotions as messaging system

00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:40.086 align:middle line:84%
to let you know you're
safe or not safe.

00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:43.089 align:middle line:84%
So when it's searching for
something you don't want to,

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:45.358 align:middle line:84%
the next day you wake up
feeling not good because it's

00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:47.594 align:middle line:84%
gone off searching for
something you don't want it to.

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:49.596 align:middle line:84%
So you mildly
dislike that TV show.

00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Or you don't like the TV show.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't-- that's too strong
a word to use in that context.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.034 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, it's
a strong word.

00:18:55.034 --> 00:18:55.635 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It is.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:56.703 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Definitely.

00:18:56.703 --> 00:18:57.837 align:middle line:84%
And it carries weight
to it, as you're saying.

00:18:57.837 --> 00:18:59.138 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It does.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.142 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the brain feels
the emotion behind the weight.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:04.444 align:middle line:84%
And probably neurochemically,
it creates more--

00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:06.546 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It lowers your
immune system, literally.

00:19:06.546 --> 00:19:08.448 align:middle line:84%
It physically lowers
your immune system.

00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:10.717 align:middle line:84%
When you use high energy words,
it boosts your immune system.

00:19:10.717 --> 00:19:13.286 align:middle line:84%
When you use low energy words,
it gets you directly in contact

00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:14.988 align:middle line:84%
with your lower
brain, your amygdala,

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.823 align:middle line:90%
and lowers your immune system.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's probably
because of, what?

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:20.293 align:middle line:84%
Stress hormones
that are released

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:21.728 align:middle line:84%
when it hears those
types of words?

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:23.463 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It puts the
unconscious on high

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:25.565 align:middle line:84%
alert, which is
what the PTSD does.

00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:28.101 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a situation
where you may be killed,

00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:31.137 align:middle line:84%
the unconscious mind's
going, [SIRENS].

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:33.806 align:middle line:84%
And it's not ever told
you to stand down.

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:36.476 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm working with people,
I just get the unconscious mind

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:37.176 align:middle line:90%
to stand down.

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.379 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:41.314 align:middle line:84%
If you repress it, and
say talk to the hand,

00:19:41.314 --> 00:19:43.616 align:middle line:84%
it's going to get a stronger
and stronger signal.

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:45.451 align:middle line:84%
And all we have to do
is say, you know what?

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:46.185 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.887 align:middle line:90%
We can calm down now.

00:19:47.887 --> 00:19:50.657 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and
then you can impact

00:19:50.657 --> 00:19:51.991 align:middle line:90%
the conscious a lot easier?

00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:53.059 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Totally.

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:53.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Without the
unconscious in the way.

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:54.894 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: There's
no reason for it

00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:57.063 align:middle line:84%
to be there if the
unconscious mind believes

00:19:57.063 --> 00:19:59.265 align:middle line:90%
the story's finished.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, what about
the word difficult?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.035 align:middle line:90%
Or that's hard?

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:03.069 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Not easy.

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:04.003 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not easy.

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:06.105 align:middle line:84%
But it still says
the same thing.

00:20:06.105 --> 00:20:07.607 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It says
the same thing.

00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:09.909 align:middle line:84%
It's just moving a bit more
towards where you want.

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:12.145 align:middle line:84%
So the old-fashioned idea
was with psychotherapists

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.547 align:middle line:84%
is they'd say, I'm
feeling really angry.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.215 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're feeling really angry.

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:17.383 align:middle line:90%
And they'd repeat it.

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:20.186 align:middle line:84%
Well, all we're doing is
going backwards into anger.

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:22.755 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you say,
I realize that.

00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:23.656 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel good.

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:25.091 align:middle line:90%
Does sit?

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:26.893 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
the unconscious mind

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:27.794 align:middle line:90%
is searching for good.

00:20:27.794 --> 00:20:29.295 align:middle line:84%
It automatically
turns the person

00:20:29.295 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:90%
in a different direction.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.164 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:32.432 align:middle line:90%
That's a great example.

00:20:32.432 --> 00:20:34.734 align:middle line:84%
So instead of the word
angry, you would say not--

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.469 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I'm not
feeling great right now.

00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:37.804 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not great, OK.

00:20:37.804 --> 00:20:39.939 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Or I'm having a really
interesting emotion coming up

00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:40.907 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:41.741 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it grabs
on to interesting?

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:42.976 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:44.877 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ah, and I'm not feeling
great grabs on to great?

00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:45.912 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:46.579 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not feeling
good grabs on to good.

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:47.146 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly, yes.

00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:47.947 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:49.082 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: And here's the thing.

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:50.783 align:middle line:84%
The thing about emotion
that's really interesting

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:53.853 align:middle line:84%
is that the negative
emotions are not real.

00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:55.154 align:middle line:90%
They feel real.

00:20:55.154 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
However, it simply
shows us an absence

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.126 align:middle line:84%
of love, joy, happiness,
and excitement.

00:21:00.126 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you have anger, it says
you haven't got your passion.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.798 align:middle line:84%
You're not able to
control your life.

00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:09.168 align:middle line:84%
If you have fear, it's
the absence of power.

00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:10.603 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well,
undoubtedly, you had

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.672 align:middle line:84%
anger from your
childhood situation.

00:21:12.672 --> 00:21:14.273 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, rage, rage.

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:16.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rage, of course.

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.244 align:middle line:90%
So how did you reframe that?

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:19.912 align:middle line:90%
And how long did that take?

00:21:19.912 --> 00:21:21.914 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It took a long
time until I discovered

00:21:21.914 --> 00:21:23.983 align:middle line:84%
the hypnosis and
the NLP, actually.

00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:26.252 align:middle line:84%
And then when I discovered
that, it was instantaneous.

00:21:26.252 --> 00:21:27.086 align:middle line:90%
It was like, wow.

00:21:27.086 --> 00:21:29.122 align:middle line:90%
This is so cool.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:31.724 align:middle line:84%
I'd worked on going into the
emotion, into the emotion,

00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:32.825 align:middle line:90%
into the emotion.

00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:34.394 align:middle line:84%
And all that does,
like talk therapy,

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:36.296 align:middle line:90%
it just expands the emotion.

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:39.065 align:middle line:84%
And it's like opening a
virus file on your computer.

00:21:39.065 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do that?

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.668 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:41.668 --> 00:21:43.236 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: You want to just
get the name of the file,

00:21:43.236 --> 00:21:44.037 align:middle line:90%
delete it.

00:21:44.037 --> 00:21:45.638 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, moving on.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.641 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
the whole situation, when

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.943 align:middle line:84%
you can see it from
all perspectives,

00:21:50.943 --> 00:21:52.712 align:middle line:84%
there's no possibility
of anger or fear.

00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:54.213 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, not only do
you have to understand it,

00:21:54.213 --> 00:21:55.481 align:middle line:90%
but you also have to believe it.

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.616 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:21:56.616 --> 00:21:57.984 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to believe
that it's this easy.

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:00.753 align:middle line:84%
And there's a belief system that
I have that it's not that easy.

00:22:00.753 --> 00:22:01.854 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Ooh.

00:22:01.854 --> 00:22:03.589 align:middle line:84%
I can so prove that
to you after the show.

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:05.892 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, well,
could we do it now?

00:22:05.892 --> 00:22:08.227 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It would take a
little while to do it now, so.

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:09.195 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:22:09.195 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It'll take
10 minutes or so.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so where
did I hear in my life

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.168 align:middle line:90%
that life wasn't easy?

00:22:15.168 --> 00:22:16.436 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:22:16.436 --> 00:22:19.038 align:middle line:84%
So basically I would take the
strongest memory you have,

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:21.174 align:middle line:84%
which keeps coming back
over and over again

00:22:21.174 --> 00:22:22.775 align:middle line:90%
because it's not complete.

00:22:22.775 --> 00:22:26.112 align:middle line:84%
And we simply just change the
place it is in your brain,

00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:27.747 align:middle line:90%
and delete the file.

00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:29.716 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We could do that.

00:22:29.716 --> 00:22:32.251 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: If you got a piece of
paper, I can write that down.

00:22:32.251 --> 00:22:33.019 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Wow, interesting.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.322 align:middle line:84%
So take the memory
that I had where

00:22:36.322 --> 00:22:39.025 align:middle line:84%
I saw in my childhood
life is not easy.

00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:39.759 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.961 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I can do it now.

00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:43.563 align:middle line:84%
We can do a one
minute thing, which

00:22:43.563 --> 00:22:46.366 align:middle line:84%
is the mind magic, which
is what I actually invented

00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:48.434 align:middle line:84%
to clear a negative emotion
or a limiting belief

00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:49.001 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:49.535 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: OK.

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:50.002 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that.

00:22:50.002 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: So what you want
to do is sit up straight,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.275 align:middle line:90%
chin up a little bit.

00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:58.244 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:22:58.244 --> 00:23:00.513 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually
in that nice position

00:23:00.513 --> 00:23:03.282 align:middle line:84%
where we're saying to the
unconscious mind, we're ready.

00:23:03.282 --> 00:23:03.983 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:03.983 --> 00:23:04.817 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: OK.

00:23:04.817 --> 00:23:06.753 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
you to do is think

00:23:06.753 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:90%
about that whatever it was.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.955 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know.

00:23:08.955 --> 00:23:12.291 align:middle line:84%
What's your phrase
for the situation?

00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:13.526 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not easy.

00:23:13.526 --> 00:23:15.795 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: No, what's your
phrase for the situation we want

00:23:15.795 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:84%
to clear, the memory
you want to clear?

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.599 align:middle line:90%
What emotion is it?

00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:21.434 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Hard,
difficult, struggle.

00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:22.301 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Struggle?

00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:23.536 align:middle line:84%
That life is hard
and a struggle?

00:23:23.536 --> 00:23:24.036 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:24.036 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.138 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Good.

00:23:25.138 --> 00:23:25.505 align:middle line:90%
So we can do that.

00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:25.972 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:23:25.972 --> 00:23:26.839 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.174 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: So what
you're gonna do

00:23:28.174 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to lay your left
hand in a loose fist-- that's

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.978 align:middle line:90%
it-- on your lap.

00:23:31.978 --> 00:23:33.413 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
going to be putting

00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:35.081 align:middle line:90%
your finger on the knuckle.

00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:35.748 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:36.883 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: That's right.

00:23:36.883 --> 00:23:38.184 align:middle line:90%
Finger up the knuckle.

00:23:38.184 --> 00:23:39.385 align:middle line:90%
Take it off.

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:41.154 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is we're
telling the unconscious mind

00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:43.189 align:middle line:84%
to release the negative
emotion and preserve

00:23:43.189 --> 00:23:45.591 align:middle line:84%
the positive lesson for
your health and benefit.

00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:47.894 align:middle line:84%
And this,
neurologically, ends up

00:23:47.894 --> 00:23:50.296 align:middle line:84%
in your gut, which is
where the emotion is.

00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:52.398 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually telling
the unconscious mind,

00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:53.933 align:middle line:84%
this meridian--
follow this meridian.

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And find it.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.535 align:middle line:90%
And delete it.

00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:56.235 align:middle line:90%
OK, you ready?

00:23:56.235 --> 00:23:56.569 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:23:56.569 --> 00:23:57.703 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:57.703 --> 00:23:59.338 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: So we're going
to look up at the ceiling.

00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:00.506 align:middle line:90%
Choose your spot.

00:24:00.506 --> 00:24:02.775 align:middle line:84%
Because you're actually
in your prefrontal cortex.

00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:05.611 align:middle line:84%
Right up at the
ceiling, OK, good.

00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:06.779 align:middle line:90%
Keep your eyes open.

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:09.682 align:middle line:84%
Because we're releasing
the emotions peripherally.

00:24:09.682 --> 00:24:10.216 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Look up.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.054 align:middle line:84%
Finger on the knuckle,
take a deep breath.

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:16.455 align:middle line:84%
And as you release
the breath, let

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:17.924 align:middle line:84%
go of the root
cause of the belief

00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:19.792 align:middle line:84%
that life is difficult
and not easy.

00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Take your finger
off the knuckle.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.829 align:middle line:90%
Release.

00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:23.329 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:24.397 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: OK.

00:24:24.397 --> 00:24:25.464 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and find where
it is in your body.

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.266 align:middle line:84%
You'll only find it a
little bit right now.

00:24:27.266 --> 00:24:27.967 align:middle line:90%
OK go ahead.

00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:28.868 align:middle line:90%
Look up.

00:24:28.868 --> 00:24:29.969 align:middle line:84%
A little bit higher
than that, Lisa.

00:24:29.969 --> 00:24:30.803 align:middle line:90%
That's it, perfect.

00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:32.772 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:24:32.772 --> 00:24:33.573 align:middle line:90%
Hold it.

00:24:33.573 --> 00:24:34.473 align:middle line:90%
Put your finger on the knuckle.

00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:35.741 align:middle line:84%
And as you release
the breath, let

00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:37.143 align:middle line:84%
go of the root
cause of the belief

00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:39.612 align:middle line:84%
that life is difficult
and not easy.

00:24:39.612 --> 00:24:40.847 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Take your finger off?

00:24:40.847 --> 00:24:42.148 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Take your finger off.

00:24:42.148 --> 00:24:44.383 align:middle line:84%
Last time, three times, because
it's like deleting a file.

00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:45.518 align:middle line:90%
It says, are you sure?

00:24:45.518 --> 00:24:46.886 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes into recycling.

00:24:46.886 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:90%
And then it's gone.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.254 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:24:48.254 --> 00:24:49.222 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: OK, go
ahead, last time.

00:24:49.222 --> 00:24:50.823 align:middle line:90%
Look up, finger on the knuckle.

00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:53.292 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:24:53.292 --> 00:24:55.928 align:middle line:90%
Release it.

00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Release the root
cause of the belief.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.333 align:middle line:84%
And release the-- finger
on the knuckle-- release

00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:02.935 align:middle line:84%
the root cause of the thing--
put your finger on the knuckle.

00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:04.103 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:25:04.103 --> 00:25:06.439 align:middle line:84%
Again, release the root
cause of the belief

00:25:06.439 --> 00:25:10.076 align:middle line:84%
that life is not easy
and has to be difficult.

00:25:10.076 --> 00:25:13.579 align:middle line:84%
OK, now how do you
feel about that belief?

00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:15.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's very,
very far, far away.

00:25:15.815 --> 00:25:17.049 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It makes it neutral.

00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:20.086 align:middle line:84%
So what would happen if
you did have that belief?

00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:22.989 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh, good question.

00:25:22.989 --> 00:25:25.625 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: What wouldn't
happen if you had that belief?

00:25:25.625 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't
have any idea-- I

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.362 align:middle line:84%
would be-- have an
easier lifestyle.

00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:32.064 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:34.734 align:middle line:84%
What wouldn't happen if you
didn't have that belief?

00:25:34.734 --> 00:25:37.536 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Um, I would stress less?

00:25:37.536 --> 00:25:38.804 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: OK.

00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:40.406 align:middle line:84%
And what wouldn't happen if
you didn't have that belief?

00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:42.508 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What wouldn't
happen-- what wouldn't happen

00:25:42.508 --> 00:25:44.176 align:middle line:84%
is that I wouldn't
have that belief.

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:45.077 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:46.312 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
just about realizing

00:25:46.312 --> 00:25:47.947 align:middle line:84%
that belief isn't
valid, isn't it?

00:25:47.947 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Because anything other than
realizing that that belief has

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.754 align:middle line:84%
no use in your life isn't going
to allow you to follow your joy

00:25:54.754 --> 00:25:57.256 align:middle line:84%
and find yourself wonderfully
relaxed and enjoying life,

00:25:57.256 --> 00:25:57.757 align:middle line:90%
is it?

00:25:57.757 --> 00:25:58.658 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:25:58.658 --> 00:25:59.225 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:00.927 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:26:00.927 --> 00:26:02.128 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it--

00:26:02.128 --> 00:26:05.798 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Now, go ahead and

00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:06.832 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It wasn't mine.

00:26:06.832 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.367 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:26:08.367 --> 00:26:09.602 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: That's how easy it is.

00:26:09.602 --> 00:26:11.337 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just, bam.

00:26:11.337 --> 00:26:12.038 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:26:12.038 --> 00:26:13.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, interesting.

00:26:13.105 --> 00:26:15.141 align:middle line:84%
Because it was-- it
puts it in perspective.

00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:16.442 align:middle line:90%
It was a long, long time ago.

00:26:16.442 --> 00:26:17.209 align:middle line:90%
It was my Mom.

00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:18.511 align:middle line:90%
And my father was in the war.

00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:19.545 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:20.479 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, so that
was difficult for--

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:22.048 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly, not easy.

00:26:22.048 --> 00:26:22.915 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:24.383 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
difficult for her.

00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure as a child I was
not realizing all of that.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.622 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And you
were being imprinted

00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:30.656 align:middle line:90%
with the whole system.

00:26:30.656 --> 00:26:32.124 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:32.124 --> 00:26:33.859 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: We copy our
mothers and fathers.

00:26:33.859 --> 00:26:35.394 align:middle line:84%
We model the person
we admire the most.

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:36.729 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of course.

00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:37.596 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And we also some model
their negative traits, as well

00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:90%
as their positive ones.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.065 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh yeah.

00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:40.366 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: So the
job that I-- when

00:26:40.366 --> 00:26:42.601 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with teenagers, I
love working with teenagers.

00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:44.203 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll say to
them, what did you

00:26:44.203 --> 00:26:45.838 align:middle line:90%
get DNA-wise from your parents?

00:26:45.838 --> 00:26:48.140 align:middle line:84%
What genetically
did you inherit?

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.009 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, Mom had
a sense of humor.

00:26:50.009 --> 00:26:50.843 align:middle line:90%
Dad was intelligent.

00:26:50.843 --> 00:26:52.611 align:middle line:90%
He was a good worker.

00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:54.413 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I'll just
say, you know what?

00:26:54.413 --> 00:26:56.148 align:middle line:84%
You chose really good
parents then, right?

00:26:56.148 --> 00:26:59.618 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go, I never
thought of it like that.

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.687 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what were the
good traits, basically?

00:27:01.687 --> 00:27:02.688 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:27:02.688 --> 00:27:03.889 align:middle line:84%
What did they need
from both parents that

00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:06.025 align:middle line:84%
would help them
with this lifetime.

00:27:06.025 --> 00:27:08.561 align:middle line:84%
And once you've got
that, it's easy.

00:27:08.561 --> 00:27:11.864 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can you
resolve addiction?

00:27:11.864 --> 00:27:12.732 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:27:12.732 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And deep,
deep DNA strains?

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.368 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:27:15.368 --> 00:27:15.868 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:15.868 --> 00:27:17.203 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You can?

00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:20.172 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And the thing is that
any addiction, sexual abuse,

00:27:20.172 --> 00:27:24.043 align:middle line:84%
even diabetes, it's like a virus
going through the family group.

00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:26.445 align:middle line:84%
Someone decided way back
to decide to get it.

00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:29.849 align:middle line:84%
Someone made a limiting
decision and then passed it on.

00:27:29.849 --> 00:27:32.518 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us to release
those limiting decisions.

00:27:32.518 --> 00:27:35.588 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can clear the
DNA as a direct result of that.

00:27:35.588 --> 00:27:37.423 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So what about pain?

00:27:37.423 --> 00:27:38.791 align:middle line:90%
What about physical pain?

00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:39.792 align:middle line:90%
Back pain, specifically?

00:27:39.792 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Physical
pain is two things.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.295 align:middle line:84%
It's toxins in your
physical body-- you're not

00:27:43.295 --> 00:27:45.431 align:middle line:90%
exercised out-- and emotional.

00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:49.201 align:middle line:84%
So any back pain--
Upledger said that-- you

00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:52.705 align:middle line:84%
know, the guy who did
craniosacral therapy--

00:27:52.705 --> 00:27:56.876 align:middle line:84%
that any back pain longer
than six weeks is emotional.

00:27:56.876 --> 00:27:58.177 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So chronic?

00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:00.513 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Chronic, and if you,
of course, read your Louise

00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:02.715 align:middle line:84%
Hay, she says lower
back pain is self worth.

00:28:02.715 --> 00:28:04.617 align:middle line:90%
Middle back pain is guilt.

00:28:04.617 --> 00:28:06.352 align:middle line:90%
And upper back pain is, um--

00:28:06.352 --> 00:28:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Overwhelmed.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.455 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It's too
much responsibility.

00:28:09.455 --> 00:28:10.689 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, OK.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:14.026 align:middle line:84%
So you could-- I mean,
maybe the first person that

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:16.729 align:middle line:84%
comes to mind of who you
have a responsibility over.

00:28:16.729 --> 00:28:18.497 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yes, so it's
who is in your back,

00:28:18.497 --> 00:28:19.532 align:middle line:90%
not what is in your back.

00:28:19.532 --> 00:28:20.933 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who is in your back.

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:22.401 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And who
are you angry at.

00:28:22.401 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You see, because
depression, to me,

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.072 align:middle line:84%
is not what are you
depressed about?

00:28:26.072 --> 00:28:27.339 align:middle line:90%
But who are you angry at?

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:30.443 align:middle line:84%
Who are you long-term angry
at that you didn't resolve?

00:28:30.443 --> 00:28:31.477 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:28:31.477 --> 00:28:32.511 align:middle line:84%
And then you can go
through the processes.

00:28:32.511 --> 00:28:34.046 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And it's
easy to clear.

00:28:34.046 --> 00:28:35.114 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:28:35.114 --> 00:28:36.482 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And taking
drugs isn't the answer.

00:28:36.482 --> 00:28:38.184 align:middle line:90%
It may be a short-term fix.

00:28:38.184 --> 00:28:39.552 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't help long-term.

00:28:39.552 --> 00:28:41.554 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The anti-inflammatory
doesn't get rid of the emotion.

00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:42.154 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: No

00:28:42.154 --> 00:28:43.089 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:28:43.089 --> 00:28:44.056 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And
something like grief.

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:45.858 align:middle line:84%
You know, you need
to grieve for a year.

00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Over a year, you need to
get back to your life.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.029 align:middle line:84%
And these techniques
are fantastically

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:51.197 align:middle line:90%
simple for clearing them.

00:28:51.197 --> 00:28:53.866 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A year, that's a
great way of looking at it.

00:28:53.866 --> 00:28:55.935 align:middle line:84%
Some people try to
run away from grief

00:28:55.935 --> 00:28:57.403 align:middle line:84%
and don't know
what to do with it.

00:28:57.403 --> 00:28:58.404 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Get right into it.

00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:00.039 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge the
unconscious mind's need

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:01.907 align:middle line:90%
to release that emotion.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It's saying there's a big
package of stuff here.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.244 align:middle line:90%
Can we clear it, please?

00:29:05.244 --> 00:29:07.313 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if somebody has
the loss of a loved one,

00:29:07.313 --> 00:29:09.615 align:middle line:84%
they should really
set aside a year?

00:29:09.615 --> 00:29:10.249 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:11.517 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To grieve?

00:29:11.517 --> 00:29:15.087 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: To grieve it, to
remember-- six months minimum.

00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:16.622 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's like, go ahead.

00:29:16.622 --> 00:29:17.756 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.191 align:middle line:90%
Really get into it.

00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:20.359 align:middle line:90%
Feel sorry for yourself.

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:21.961 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
grief is about, really.

00:29:21.961 --> 00:29:24.396 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can still continue
with your responsibilities.

00:29:24.396 --> 00:29:25.498 align:middle line:90%
But not overdo it, right?

00:29:25.498 --> 00:29:26.365 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:29:26.365 --> 00:29:27.166 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and after a
year, we're done.

00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:31.804 align:middle line:84%
All right, this
word, no problem.

00:29:31.804 --> 00:29:32.838 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Oh, I know.

00:29:32.838 --> 00:29:33.239 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't like that one.

00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:34.306 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:29:34.306 --> 00:29:35.374 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: That's my
biggie I want to clear.

00:29:35.374 --> 00:29:37.943 align:middle line:90%
It means you're welcome.

00:29:37.943 --> 00:29:41.113 align:middle line:84%
It literally says,
you're welcome.

00:29:41.113 --> 00:29:43.015 align:middle line:90%
Or, it's all good.

00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:46.986 align:middle line:84%
Why would you mention problems
when there's no problem?

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:47.686 align:middle line:90%
The interesting--

00:29:47.686 --> 00:29:48.521 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:49.421 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: --thing
is, when I teach

00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:51.657 align:middle line:84%
hypnosis to people,
what I realized

00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:53.425 align:middle line:84%
during the training
was people were leaning

00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:55.528 align:middle line:84%
forward and saying,
so just let go

00:29:55.528 --> 00:29:57.062 align:middle line:90%
of all the worry, and anxiety.

00:29:57.062 --> 00:29:58.497 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, whoa,
we didn't even

00:29:58.497 --> 00:29:59.832 align:middle line:90%
have that before you said it!

00:29:59.832 --> 00:30:01.934 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, where's the mouth?

00:30:01.934 --> 00:30:03.068 align:middle line:90%
Where's the mouth?

00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:05.504 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized the
whole four-day training--

00:30:05.504 --> 00:30:06.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: [LAUGHS]

00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:07.506 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I know.

00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:10.743 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling good,
actually, two minutes ago.

00:30:10.743 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And I give them 20 poker chips,
or little coins, or whatever.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.881 align:middle line:90%
And we play it as a game.

00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:17.683 align:middle line:84%
And I say, whenever
you say a low energy

00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:19.552 align:middle line:84%
word for the next
four days, someone's

00:30:19.552 --> 00:30:21.420 align:middle line:84%
going to chip you,
and switch you.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.923 align:middle line:84%
And you have to replace it
with a high energy word.

00:30:23.923 --> 00:30:25.357 align:middle line:90%
So if someone says, don't worry.

00:30:25.357 --> 00:30:26.458 align:middle line:90%
And someone says, switch.

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:28.327 align:middle line:90%
They have to give a coin.

00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:31.263 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to
say, you'll be fine.

00:30:31.263 --> 00:30:33.065 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is a great game.

00:30:33.065 --> 00:30:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It treats--
it really does.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.001 align:middle line:84%
You can play it
with your friends.

00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:37.136 align:middle line:84%
You can play it
with someone there.

00:30:37.136 --> 00:30:38.571 align:middle line:84%
You need to have an
agreement with them

00:30:38.571 --> 00:30:40.105 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to do it though.

00:30:40.105 --> 00:30:41.941 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise people
take it personally.

00:30:41.941 --> 00:30:43.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, it
could be annoying.

00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:44.643 align:middle line:84%

00:30:44.643 --> 00:30:46.712 align:middle line:84%
I can't say anything

00:30:46.712 --> 00:30:47.846 align:middle line:90%
It's like, yes.

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.448 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what you're doing
to your unconscious mind.

00:30:49.448 --> 00:30:50.816 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great idea.

00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:53.519 align:middle line:84%
But can you really
change an old, old habit?

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.486 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes, you can.

00:30:54.486 --> 00:30:55.454 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In four days?

00:30:55.454 --> 00:30:56.555 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's really fast.

00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:57.556 align:middle line:90%
It's really fast.

00:30:57.556 --> 00:30:59.725 align:middle line:90%
And it took me a long time.

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:02.595 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, the more I
teach it, the faster it gets.

00:31:02.595 --> 00:31:04.296 align:middle line:84%
The changes occur
really quickly.

00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:06.899 align:middle line:84%
And people on the third
day will be saying,

00:31:06.899 --> 00:31:09.868 align:middle line:84%
I'll get back to you
when I've rethought it.

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:10.703 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:31:10.703 --> 00:31:12.238 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's very fascinating.

00:31:12.238 --> 00:31:15.841 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you just need to,
by habit, change your language?

00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yes, and you're not
aware of your own language.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.712 align:middle line:90%
So you do need a switch buddy.

00:31:19.712 --> 00:31:20.946 align:middle line:90%
I call it a switch buddy.

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:22.314 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A switch buddy, yeah.

00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, so get someone
in to help you so that you say,

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.387 align:middle line:84%
every time I say a low energy
word, could you switch me?

00:31:28.387 --> 00:31:30.789 align:middle line:84%
And I use low energy words
and high energy words

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:32.825 align:middle line:84%
rather than positive
and negative.

00:31:32.825 --> 00:31:35.294 align:middle line:84%
Because when I looked up the
word positive on the internet,

00:31:35.294 --> 00:31:36.195 align:middle line:90%
guess what came back?

00:31:36.195 --> 00:31:37.162 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: High energy.

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:37.696 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: No.

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:38.497 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What?

00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:40.566 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Hepatitis C, HIV--

00:31:40.566 --> 00:31:41.333 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:42.301 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I know.

00:31:42.301 --> 00:31:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It's got a whole
different connotation now

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.604 align:middle line:90%
than it used to have.

00:31:45.604 --> 00:31:46.772 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:31:46.772 --> 00:31:48.574 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, and of
course negative and positive

00:31:48.574 --> 00:31:50.542 align:middle line:84%
are polarity-based
again, which is limbic.

00:31:50.542 --> 00:31:53.012 align:middle line:90%
So we want to get variations.

00:31:53.012 --> 00:31:56.548 align:middle line:84%
So love has a different
energy than excitement.

00:31:56.548 --> 00:31:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.753 align:middle line:84%
So when you looked up
negative, what is that?

00:32:00.753 --> 00:32:02.588 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It brings
up all the negative.

00:32:02.588 --> 00:32:03.789 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.991 align:middle line:90%
Easy enough.

00:32:05.991 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, forgot, this is great.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.761 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Didn't remember.

00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:09.828 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I didn't remember.

00:32:09.828 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
fear of forgetting.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.098 align:middle line:90%
As we age, the memory quote--

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:15.301 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I'm going to say
to you, don't remember it.

00:32:15.301 --> 00:32:16.435 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You don't remember.

00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:17.903 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Don't remember it.

00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:19.171 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, when, ah!

00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:20.272 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Do not remember.

00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:20.806 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go, what do
you mean, don't remember?

00:32:20.806 --> 00:32:21.573 align:middle line:90%
Don't remember?

00:32:21.573 --> 00:32:22.274 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Remember.

00:32:22.274 --> 00:32:23.242 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Oh, remember.

00:32:23.242 --> 00:32:24.943 align:middle line:84%
You've got to say
it three times.

00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:27.579 align:middle line:84%
So if I say don't forget
your lunch to a child,

00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:28.681 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
forget their lunch.

00:32:28.681 --> 00:32:30.349 align:middle line:84%
Because you've given them
a direct instruction.

00:32:30.349 --> 00:32:32.618 align:middle line:84%
If I say, don't remember
your lunch, they'll go, what?

00:32:32.618 --> 00:32:33.519 align:middle line:90%
Don't remember.

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:34.753 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or just,
remember your lunch.

00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:35.654 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Remember your lunch.

00:32:35.654 --> 00:32:36.355 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Remember your keys.

00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:36.855 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: That's right.

00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:37.289 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:38.057 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:32:38.057 --> 00:32:39.458 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I know it's simple.

00:32:39.458 --> 00:32:40.125 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:42.094 align:middle line:90%
But it's good.

00:32:42.094 --> 00:32:43.195 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's all good.

00:32:43.195 --> 00:32:47.099 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so now let's
talk about anxiety, fear.

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:50.336 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Right, anxiety
is-- fear and anxiety,

00:32:50.336 --> 00:32:52.104 align:middle line:84%
people get mixed up
about fear and anxiety.

00:32:52.104 --> 00:32:53.539 align:middle line:90%
Fear is a past-based emotion.

00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:55.474 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety and worry
are future-based.

00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:56.575 align:middle line:90%
They haven't happened yet.

00:32:56.575 --> 00:32:57.776 align:middle line:90%
They haven't concluded.

00:32:57.776 --> 00:32:59.411 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's a
never-ending story.

00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:00.412 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:00.412 --> 00:33:02.247 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: So what's
very interesting is

00:33:02.247 --> 00:33:05.984 align:middle line:84%
your unconscious mind perceives
it as a, are we safe yet?

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:06.652 align:middle line:90%
Are we safe yet?

00:33:06.652 --> 00:33:07.519 align:middle line:90%
Are we safe yet?

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:09.655 align:middle line:84%
And you get caught
up in the loops.

00:33:09.655 --> 00:33:12.491 align:middle line:84%
So very easily, I invented a
thing called personal freedom

00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:13.292 align:middle line:90%
matrix.

00:33:13.292 --> 00:33:14.259 align:middle line:90%
So you want to do that?

00:33:14.259 --> 00:33:14.993 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:16.395 align:middle line:90%
Personal freedom matrix, OK.

00:33:16.395 --> 00:33:18.397 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Because
I realized if past,

00:33:18.397 --> 00:33:20.332 align:middle line:90%
present, and future are a one.

00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:24.069 align:middle line:84%
And we have really no--
it's just a convenience.

00:33:24.069 --> 00:33:26.538 align:middle line:84%
If the future is the
same as the past,

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:28.574 align:middle line:90%
it's the same energy area.

00:33:28.574 --> 00:33:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we do, we tend to think
of the past and the present.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:34.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't tend to think
of the future as real.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.116 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not in our
physical body as a memory.

00:33:37.116 --> 00:33:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:38.784 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: We have our past.

00:33:38.784 --> 00:33:39.885 align:middle line:84%
We hold our emotions
in our body--

00:33:39.885 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Unless you do
visualization, but yeah.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.889 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, we hold
our emotions in our body.

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:45.624 align:middle line:84%
And the visualization
leaves the memory

00:33:45.624 --> 00:33:47.426 align:middle line:90%
floating out there somewhere.

00:33:47.426 --> 00:33:49.194 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, why don't
we get that memory

00:33:49.194 --> 00:33:50.963 align:middle line:90%
and bring it back to the body?

00:33:50.963 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And plant it in the body along
with the fabulous emotion?

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.735 align:middle line:84%
The unconsciousness
mind says, awesome.

00:33:56.735 --> 00:33:57.870 align:middle line:90%
We had a happy ending.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.072 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to do any
worry or anxiety anymore.

00:34:00.072 --> 00:34:01.607 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you would,
of course, find

00:34:01.607 --> 00:34:04.543 align:middle line:84%
the positive or the
feel good situation

00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:05.711 align:middle line:90%
and bring it into the body?

00:34:05.711 --> 00:34:06.578 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yes, and
bring it into the body.

00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:07.045 align:middle line:90%
Bring it in.

00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.414 align:middle line:90%
Lock it in.

00:34:08.414 --> 00:34:09.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what anxiety is
is usually a negative situation

00:34:09.815 --> 00:34:11.417 align:middle line:84%
that's floating out there
that hasn't happened yet.

00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:12.684 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: That's right.

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:14.652 align:middle line:84%
You have all these case
scenarios of what would happen.

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:16.755 align:middle line:84%
If you already know
it's a happy ending,

00:34:16.755 --> 00:34:18.322 align:middle line:84%
you're not even
thinking about it.

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:19.491 align:middle line:90%
So you want to do it?

00:34:19.491 --> 00:34:19.992 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:19.992 --> 00:34:20.525 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: OK.

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:21.427 align:middle line:90%
Takes two minutes.

00:34:21.427 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.829 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: This is
something we can do.

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:25.898 align:middle line:84%
So think of how old
you are at the moment.

00:34:25.898 --> 00:34:26.764 align:middle line:90%
We won't display it.

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.135 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: How many
years will it be

00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:32.471 align:middle line:84%
before you are absolutely
free on every level,

00:34:32.471 --> 00:34:37.376 align:middle line:84%
physically, emotionally,
financially, everything?

00:34:37.376 --> 00:34:39.445 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many
years will it be?

00:34:39.445 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, realistically.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.648 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't know.

00:34:42.648 --> 00:34:43.581 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: First number that
comes into your head is?

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:44.483 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 15?

00:34:44.483 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Wow, OK.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.185 align:middle line:90%
We can so change that.

00:34:46.185 --> 00:34:46.652 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:34:46.652 --> 00:34:47.252 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:48.719 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: OK, Good.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.856 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and close
your eyes briefly.

00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:53.125 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else
watching can do this, too.

00:34:53.125 --> 00:34:54.493 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and close your eyes.

00:34:54.493 --> 00:34:57.463 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and float above your
body all the way to the future.

00:34:57.463 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And find that you of the future,
who is happy, free, slim,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.568 align:middle line:90%
joyful.

00:35:02.568 --> 00:35:04.903 align:middle line:84%
And watch her as she goes
about her everyday life.

00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:07.639 align:middle line:84%
As you're watching her,
I want you to see her

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:11.643 align:middle line:84%
with her wonderful daughter and
her wonderful house, absolutely

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:14.413 align:middle line:84%
fabulous friends,
amazing career where

00:35:14.413 --> 00:35:15.781 align:middle line:90%
you're traveling the world.

00:35:15.781 --> 00:35:17.349 align:middle line:90%
You've got your book out there.

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:19.918 align:middle line:84%
You've got videos,
TV, everything,

00:35:19.918 --> 00:35:21.553 align:middle line:90%
all really wonderful.

00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:23.956 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually see
the joy and the confidence

00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:26.525 align:middle line:90%
emanating from yourself.

00:35:26.525 --> 00:35:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.862 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And as you're watching
that, she suddenly spots you.

00:35:29.862 --> 00:35:30.796 align:middle line:90%
And she says, Lisa.

00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:32.798 align:middle line:90%
You took your time to find me!

00:35:32.798 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I've been waiting for you here!

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.335 align:middle line:90%
Look at what we've got!

00:35:36.335 --> 00:35:37.302 align:middle line:90%
It's fabulous.

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to
show you the house,

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.771 align:middle line:90%
show you where she's living.

00:35:39.771 --> 00:35:41.840 align:middle line:84%
She's going to show you
the second and third house

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.543 align:middle line:84%
in different countries,
the beautiful travel,

00:35:44.543 --> 00:35:46.178 align:middle line:84%
the way you're
impacting the world,

00:35:46.178 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:84%
the way you're really
making a difference

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.448 align:middle line:90%
and how wonderful it is.

00:35:49.448 --> 00:35:51.617 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to say, let
me give you some advice.

00:35:54.219 --> 00:35:56.722 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you what I need
to do, what you need to do,

00:35:56.722 --> 00:35:59.625 align:middle line:84%
to make us get here
faster than this.

00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:02.427 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that
comes into your head is?

00:36:02.427 --> 00:36:03.095 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Relax.

00:36:03.095 --> 00:36:04.263 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Relax, OK.

00:36:04.263 --> 00:36:05.531 align:middle line:90%
So time for you to relax.

00:36:05.531 --> 00:36:08.467 align:middle line:84%
Because you want to make
changes right now, haven't you?

00:36:08.467 --> 00:36:11.537 align:middle line:84%
And as you take that advice,
she's going to give you a box.

00:36:11.537 --> 00:36:12.871 align:middle line:90%
She's going to give you a gift.

00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:15.507 align:middle line:84%
So take something
out of the box.

00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:17.042 align:middle line:90%
What are you taking out?

00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:17.843 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Keys.

00:36:17.843 --> 00:36:18.477 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Keys?

00:36:18.477 --> 00:36:19.378 align:middle line:90%
What kind of keys?

00:36:19.378 --> 00:36:23.615 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Keys to
unlock your future.

00:36:23.615 --> 00:36:25.217 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: OK, what
color are the keys?

00:36:25.217 --> 00:36:25.851 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yellow.

00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:26.418 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Good.

00:36:26.418 --> 00:36:27.286 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:29.388 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
self-empowerment.

00:36:29.388 --> 00:36:30.856 align:middle line:84%
And also, she's
going to give you

00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:34.226 align:middle line:84%
the gift of everything she knows
then that you don't know yet,

00:36:34.226 --> 00:36:36.161 align:middle line:90%
the resource, the information.

00:36:36.161 --> 00:36:38.096 align:middle line:84%
And we always say, if
we were 20 years old

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:39.731 align:middle line:84%
and we had the
information we have now,

00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:40.933 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't life have
been different.

00:36:40.933 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.534 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:43.802 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: So she's
going to give you that.

00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:45.404 align:middle line:84%
I want you to lock
that into your body.

00:36:45.404 --> 00:36:46.538 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:36:46.538 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Lock it in.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.977 align:middle line:84%
And then literally color the
whole picture with one color.

00:36:51.977 --> 00:36:53.412 align:middle line:90%
Choose a color from the rainbow.

00:36:53.412 --> 00:36:55.314 align:middle line:84%
What color would
you like to choose?

00:36:55.314 --> 00:36:56.014 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Purple.

00:36:56.014 --> 00:36:57.349 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Purple, awesome.

00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:59.418 align:middle line:84%
Color the whole
thing with purple.

00:36:59.418 --> 00:37:03.622 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath of that
purple into your heart,

00:37:03.622 --> 00:37:05.691 align:middle line:84%
along with the keys,
along with the resources,

00:37:05.691 --> 00:37:06.625 align:middle line:90%
along with the advice.

00:37:06.625 --> 00:37:07.993 align:middle line:90%
Lock it into your heart.

00:37:07.993 --> 00:37:09.962 align:middle line:84%
And then find the one
little cell in your heart

00:37:09.962 --> 00:37:12.364 align:middle line:84%
that has the most of
that purple in it.

00:37:12.364 --> 00:37:14.666 align:middle line:84%
And put a face, and two
little arms and legs on it.

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:17.102 align:middle line:84%
And see it high-five and hug
every cell in your heart,

00:37:17.102 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:84%
in your lungs, in
your liver, right down

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.673 align:middle line:84%
your spine through your legs
to your toes, up your toes,

00:37:21.673 --> 00:37:24.443 align:middle line:84%
up your spine, strengthening
and uplifting your spine

00:37:24.443 --> 00:37:27.145 align:middle line:84%
to your shoulders, your
fingers, your neck, your face,

00:37:27.145 --> 00:37:29.881 align:middle line:84%
every hair follicle tingling
and alive with that freedom

00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:31.049 align:middle line:90%
and that purple.

00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:32.217 align:middle line:90%
Lock it into your body.

00:37:32.217 --> 00:37:33.218 align:middle line:90%
And open your eyes.

00:37:33.218 --> 00:37:33.719 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:34.786 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:36.321 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Now, how many
years before you're

00:37:36.321 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:90%
going to be happy and free?

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.157 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Now?

00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:40.025 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's different.

00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:40.659 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:40.659 --> 00:37:41.493 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is great.

00:37:41.493 --> 00:37:42.661 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Isn't it?

00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:44.363 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because I was just
recently working on this.

00:37:44.363 --> 00:37:45.764 align:middle line:90%
I have a book coming out.

00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:47.566 align:middle line:90%
And I am nervous about it.

00:37:47.566 --> 00:37:50.736 align:middle line:84%
And you think, how is
it going to be received?

00:37:50.736 --> 00:37:53.705 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I've
been thinking of, well,

00:37:53.705 --> 00:37:55.173 align:middle line:90%
what if someone doesn't like it?

00:37:55.173 --> 00:37:57.476 align:middle line:84%
More than I've been
thinking of, how many people

00:37:57.476 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:90%
will be impacted and love it?

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.445 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Exactly, what
difference can you make?

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:02.114 align:middle line:84%
And once you get
to highest values,

00:38:02.114 --> 00:38:04.650 align:middle line:84%
once you get to that idea
of helping the planet

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.418 align:middle line:84%
and helping people,
nothing else matters.

00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:07.619 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking about
this on the way here today.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.321 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Isn't that cool?

00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:10.055 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is great.

00:38:10.055 --> 00:38:10.622 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's awesome.

00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Fantastic.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:12.224 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: That's how fast it is.

00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:13.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it's great.

00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:14.192 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I know.

00:38:14.192 --> 00:38:15.494 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:38:15.494 --> 00:38:17.095 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're going to take
a look at another video here

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:19.197 align:middle line:84%
of Dr. Yvonne taking us
through another process.

00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:19.698 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:38:20.766 --> 00:38:22.768 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Hello,
this is Dr. Yvonne.

00:38:22.768 --> 00:38:24.936 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Every
Word Has Power."

00:38:24.936 --> 00:38:28.206 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to
learn mind magic, how

00:38:28.206 --> 00:38:31.643 align:middle line:84%
to release a negative emotion
in less than a minute.

00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:34.012 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions are your
survival mechanism.

00:38:34.012 --> 00:38:36.448 align:middle line:84%
Your unconscious
mind uses emotions

00:38:36.448 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:84%
as a messaging
system to you to let

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:41.319 align:middle line:84%
you know whether you're
safe or not safe.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.722 align:middle line:84%
All those emotions are
attached to the word you use.

00:38:43.722 --> 00:38:45.557 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn
about the words later.

00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
For now, we're going to release
those emotions as they come up

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.928 align:middle line:90%
on a day-to-day basis.

00:38:49.928 --> 00:38:50.796 align:middle line:90%
This is magic.

00:38:50.796 --> 00:38:53.231 align:middle line:84%
You'll find it
works really well.

00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:55.267 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to release
them in a set order.

00:38:55.267 --> 00:38:57.436 align:middle line:84%
We're going to release them
first of all with anger,

00:38:57.436 --> 00:39:01.239 align:middle line:84%
then sadness, then
fear, then guilt.

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:03.075 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is a whole
other emotion.

00:39:03.075 --> 00:39:04.342 align:middle line:90%
It's a future-based emotion.

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:06.478 align:middle line:84%
So we'll deal with
that at a future time.

00:39:06.478 --> 00:39:08.280 align:middle line:84%
For now, I'd like
to teach you how

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.149 align:middle line:84%
to relax your body so that
you can talk to your mind.

00:39:11.149 --> 00:39:13.585 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead initially,
and back straight.

00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:14.953 align:middle line:90%
And put your chin up.

00:39:14.953 --> 00:39:17.422 align:middle line:84%
And the expression "keep your
chin up" means stay optimistic.

00:39:17.422 --> 00:39:20.225 align:middle line:84%
Use a different part of your
mind, the prefrontal cortex,

00:39:20.225 --> 00:39:22.661 align:middle line:84%
which is what I call
the happy brain.

00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:25.897 align:middle line:84%
So as we get our chin
up and back straight,

00:39:25.897 --> 00:39:27.833 align:middle line:84%
you're going to actually
take a deep breath

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:30.168 align:middle line:90%
to relax your diaphragm here.

00:39:30.168 --> 00:39:32.237 align:middle line:84%
And if you put your hand
on your stomach like this

00:39:32.237 --> 00:39:36.742 align:middle line:84%
and take a deep breath so
that the hand comes out,

00:39:36.742 --> 00:39:38.009 align:middle line:90%
that's the correct breath.

00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:41.179 align:middle line:84%
Because what that does is
it pushes the diaphragm down

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:42.848 align:middle line:84%
and actually tells
your unconscious mind

00:39:42.848 --> 00:39:43.815 align:middle line:90%
that the danger's over.

00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:44.382 align:middle line:90%
We're good.

00:39:44.382 --> 00:39:45.484 align:middle line:90%
We can relax.

00:39:45.484 --> 00:39:47.652 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and make
sure your tongue's

00:39:47.652 --> 00:39:48.854 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of your mouth.

00:39:48.854 --> 00:39:52.557 align:middle line:84%
And your mouth is nice
and relaxed, like that.

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:53.859 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:39:53.859 --> 00:39:55.994 align:middle line:84%
And you'll already be feeling
a lot more calm, a lot more

00:39:55.994 --> 00:39:57.362 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:39:57.362 --> 00:39:59.698 align:middle line:84%
And as you're looking at
me, and I'm looking at you,

00:39:59.698 --> 00:40:00.899 align:middle line:84%
I want you to become
aware of what's

00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:02.267 align:middle line:84%
on the right and
the left of you.

00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:04.102 align:middle line:84%
I can see a lamp here
and a mirror here,

00:40:04.102 --> 00:40:06.271 align:middle line:90%
even while I'm looking at you.

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:08.673 align:middle line:84%
And that takes me into
the peripheral vision,

00:40:08.673 --> 00:40:11.209 align:middle line:84%
and actually takes me
into the state of alpha.

00:40:11.209 --> 00:40:14.446 align:middle line:84%
The Hawaiians call that
Hakalau, the learning state.

00:40:14.446 --> 00:40:17.449 align:middle line:84%
So if you know any kids,
or you're actually in class

00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:19.885 align:middle line:84%
learning anything, this
is a great place to be.

00:40:19.885 --> 00:40:21.887 align:middle line:84%
Just actually looking
forward and being

00:40:21.887 --> 00:40:25.323 align:middle line:84%
aware of the whole room
allows you to access directly

00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:26.758 align:middle line:84%
to the unconscious
mind and allows

00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:29.494 align:middle line:84%
you to feel good and get
that information stored.

00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:32.864 align:middle line:84%
So next stage, what
we're going to do

00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:34.833 align:middle line:90%
is teach you how to anchor.

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:36.701 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
NLP technique that

00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:40.138 align:middle line:84%
anchors the memory and the
instruction into your body.

00:40:40.138 --> 00:40:42.007 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
take your left hand.

00:40:42.007 --> 00:40:44.342 align:middle line:84%
And place it in a loose
fist on your knee,

00:40:44.342 --> 00:40:45.777 align:middle line:90%
or wherever you want to.

00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:47.312 align:middle line:90%
And take you right finger tip.

00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:49.214 align:middle line:84%
And place the tip
of the fingertip

00:40:49.214 --> 00:40:51.817 align:middle line:84%
on the knuckle,
the first knuckle.

00:40:51.817 --> 00:40:54.219 align:middle line:84%
This meridian actually
leads all the way

00:40:54.219 --> 00:40:55.954 align:middle line:84%
to your stomach
and those emotions.

00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:58.757 align:middle line:84%
So you actually have
a direct contact

00:40:58.757 --> 00:41:00.792 align:middle line:84%
with emotions when
you actually do this.

00:41:00.792 --> 00:41:02.127 align:middle line:90%
So that's anchoring.

00:41:02.127 --> 00:41:03.495 align:middle line:84%
You're going to place
this finger on the knuckle

00:41:03.495 --> 00:41:04.863 align:middle line:84%
whenever you're
speaking, whenever you're

00:41:04.863 --> 00:41:06.698 align:middle line:84%
giving the unconscious
mind the instruction.

00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:09.167 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
release the hands.

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:10.468 align:middle line:90%
We're going to work with anger.

00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:12.103 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I'd
like you to think

00:41:12.103 --> 00:41:15.006 align:middle line:84%
of a time when you were angry,
a time when you were frustrated.

00:41:15.006 --> 00:41:17.909 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you
put your head down.

00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:19.578 align:middle line:84%
And that's the easiest
way to access it.

00:41:19.578 --> 00:41:21.313 align:middle line:90%
Find where it is in your body.

00:41:21.313 --> 00:41:23.014 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you don't
even need the memory.

00:41:23.014 --> 00:41:25.517 align:middle line:84%
You can just find the
space in your body.

00:41:25.517 --> 00:41:27.752 align:middle line:84%
And I've got something
happening around here.

00:41:27.752 --> 00:41:29.154 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:41:29.154 --> 00:41:30.288 align:middle line:90%
Now I know where it is.

00:41:30.288 --> 00:41:32.757 align:middle line:84%
I can know that when I've
released it, it's gone.

00:41:32.757 --> 00:41:34.693 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to look up.

00:41:34.693 --> 00:41:36.461 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose a
spot on the ceiling.

00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of what's on
the right and the left.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.831 align:middle line:90%
Put my finger on the knuckle.

00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:42.801 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:45.604 align:middle line:84%
And as I release the
breath, I'm going to say,

00:41:45.604 --> 00:41:48.173 align:middle line:84%
I'm letting go of the root cause
of the anger and frustration

00:41:48.173 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:84%
preserving the positive lessons
for my health and benefit.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.844 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:41:52.844 --> 00:41:54.246 align:middle line:90%
It already feels better.

00:41:54.246 --> 00:41:58.383 align:middle line:84%
When I look down and access it,
it's just kind of waving at me.

00:41:58.383 --> 00:42:00.051 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
that three times.

00:42:00.051 --> 00:42:01.419 align:middle line:90%
The third time, it will be gone.

00:42:01.419 --> 00:42:03.588 align:middle line:84%
This is like deleting a
file on your computer.

00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:05.090 align:middle line:90%
You know the name of it.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.324 align:middle line:90%
You access it.

00:42:06.324 --> 00:42:08.126 align:middle line:84%
And it says, are you sure
you want to delete that file?

00:42:08.126 --> 00:42:09.861 align:middle line:90%
And you say, yes, thank you.

00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes into
recycle, and out.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.199 align:middle line:84%
So three times
with each emotion.

00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:15.967 align:middle line:90%
Second time for anger, ready?

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:16.468 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:42:16.468 --> 00:42:17.469 align:middle line:90%
Look down.

00:42:17.469 --> 00:42:19.504 align:middle line:84%
It may not be there
very much right now.

00:42:19.504 --> 00:42:20.772 align:middle line:90%
And look up.

00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:22.073 align:middle line:90%
Choose a spot on the ceiling.

00:42:22.073 --> 00:42:23.008 align:middle line:90%
Finger on the knuckle.

00:42:23.008 --> 00:42:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:27.078 align:middle line:84%
Release the root cause of
the anger and frustration.

00:42:27.078 --> 00:42:30.582 align:middle line:84%
Preserve the positive lessons
for my health and benefit.

00:42:30.582 --> 00:42:31.883 align:middle line:90%
I look down.

00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:34.653 align:middle line:84%
It's barely there
at all, if at all.

00:42:34.653 --> 00:42:37.789 align:middle line:84%
And then last time-- it's
in the recycle box now.

00:42:37.789 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:90%
I look up.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.125 align:middle line:90%
Choose a spot on the ceiling.

00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:41.226 align:middle line:84%
Finger on the
knuckle, become aware

00:42:41.226 --> 00:42:42.294 align:middle line:90%
of the right and the left.

00:42:42.294 --> 00:42:43.962 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:42:43.962 --> 00:42:46.665 align:middle line:84%
Release the negative emotion
of anger and frustration.

00:42:46.665 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Preserve the positive lessons
for my health and benefit.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:52.837 align:middle line:90%
And it's gone.

00:42:52.837 --> 00:42:54.806 align:middle line:90%
It actually is completely gone.

00:42:54.806 --> 00:42:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it magic?

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.841 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was fabulous.

00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is great,
when we can actually

00:42:58.410 --> 00:42:59.477 align:middle line:90%
turn this into a workshop.

00:42:59.477 --> 00:43:00.078 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:43:00.078 --> 00:43:01.413 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I know.

00:43:01.413 --> 00:43:02.747 align:middle line:90%
I'm all into practicality.

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.783 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is an
interactive show.

00:43:04.783 --> 00:43:07.752 align:middle line:84%
So one of the biggest things
that you hear about is what?

00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:08.587 align:middle line:90%
Procrastination?

00:43:08.587 --> 00:43:09.087 align:middle line:90%
What is?

00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:09.721 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:43:09.721 --> 00:43:10.922 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that a biggie?

00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:12.457 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Procrastination
is-- again,

00:43:12.457 --> 00:43:15.794 align:middle line:84%
it's that idea that of
least good case scenario.

00:43:15.794 --> 00:43:19.798 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, when someone
has stage fright, for instance.

00:43:19.798 --> 00:43:22.801 align:middle line:84%
And then they're-- they get into
the point where they actually

00:43:22.801 --> 00:43:26.404 align:middle line:84%
stop the video is just
before they go on the stage.

00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:27.472 align:middle line:90%
So they're like, what if?

00:43:27.472 --> 00:43:28.006 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:43:28.006 --> 00:43:28.540 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.474 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:30.175 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And, of
course, then they're

00:43:30.175 --> 00:43:31.276 align:middle line:90%
going to get on the stage.

00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:32.510 align:middle line:84%
They're going to show
themselves as insecure.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.079 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they're going
to get exactly the result

00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:35.413 align:middle line:90%
that they were thinking of.

00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we simply take
the person to the end of it

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.885 align:middle line:84%
when they're standing
on the stage saying,

00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:41.987 align:middle line:90%
thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:43:41.987 --> 00:43:43.188 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's going, woo!

00:43:43.188 --> 00:43:44.022 align:middle line:90%
You changed my life!

00:43:44.022 --> 00:43:44.756 align:middle line:90%
Amazing!

00:43:44.756 --> 00:43:46.124 align:middle line:90%
Coming up and shaking hands.

00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:47.225 align:middle line:90%
Feel good.

00:43:47.225 --> 00:43:48.493 align:middle line:84%
Turn the colors up, the
sounds, the feelings.

00:43:48.493 --> 00:43:49.427 align:middle line:90%
Lock it into the body.

00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:50.595 align:middle line:90%
And there's no stage fright.

00:43:50.595 --> 00:43:51.896 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:53.164 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you walk onto the
stage with that visualization?

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:55.133 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: You actually
stand there on the stage

00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:57.202 align:middle line:84%
after the successful
completion of your talk.

00:43:57.202 --> 00:43:59.004 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But then when
you go on to speak,

00:43:59.004 --> 00:44:00.705 align:middle line:84%
you can bring that
feeling forward?

00:44:00.705 --> 00:44:02.173 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: That's all the
feeling have in your head

00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:03.742 align:middle line:84%
because you already
have the happy ending.

00:44:03.742 --> 00:44:04.776 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:44:04.776 --> 00:44:05.643 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: There's no
possibility of having

00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:07.045 align:middle line:84%
the anxiety or the
procrastination.

00:44:07.045 --> 00:44:10.015 align:middle line:84%
Same if you've got like--
you need to do your taxes,

00:44:10.015 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
or you need to paint a
room, or clear it up.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.253 align:middle line:84%
If you visualize yourself
with the time-- of course,

00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:19.491 align:middle line:84%
it has to be like a day or two
or a timeline-- on that date,

00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:22.093 align:middle line:84%
walking in and seeing the
room tidy, seeing the room,

00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:23.261 align:middle line:90%
ah amazing.

00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:23.928 align:middle line:90%
Feels great.

00:44:23.928 --> 00:44:24.596 align:middle line:90%
Feels wonderful.

00:44:24.596 --> 00:44:25.797 align:middle line:90%
Lock it in.

00:44:25.797 --> 00:44:26.297 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep.

00:44:26.297 --> 00:44:27.632 align:middle line:90%
And it's done.

00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:29.567 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you can do
this for any situation?

00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:31.536 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Anything,
Any situation at all.

00:44:31.536 --> 00:44:33.805 align:middle line:84%
Any situation where
you've built up anything,

00:44:33.805 --> 00:44:37.042 align:middle line:84%
you can go to afterwards,
even an interview, an exam.

00:44:37.042 --> 00:44:37.809 align:middle line:90%
Imagine yourself.

00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Spend two minutes imagining--

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.612 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exam, right.

00:44:40.612 --> 00:44:41.713 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Getting the exam.

00:44:41.713 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Walking out.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.415 align:middle line:90%
Seeing that result.

00:44:43.415 --> 00:44:44.215 align:middle line:90%
Getting the dates on it.

00:44:44.215 --> 00:44:44.983 align:middle line:90%
Going yes, oh my God!

00:44:44.983 --> 00:44:45.483 align:middle line:90%
I did it!

00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:46.651 align:middle line:90%
I passed it!

00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:47.852 align:middle line:90%
Yes, lock it in.

00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:48.953 align:middle line:90%
And then go into the exam.

00:44:48.953 --> 00:44:50.021 align:middle line:90%
And it's fine.

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What happens
if that doesn't work?

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:53.458 align:middle line:84%
If you have done
the visualization,

00:44:53.458 --> 00:44:55.827 align:middle line:84%
and you've done everything
that you know to do,

00:44:55.827 --> 00:44:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and the result doesn't come up
the way that you visualized it?

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.165 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Then you
need to retake the exam

00:45:00.165 --> 00:45:03.001 align:middle line:84%
and learn a bit better, or
get somebody to help you.

00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:04.669 align:middle line:84%
Because quite often,
it's the teachers

00:45:04.669 --> 00:45:07.572 align:middle line:84%
who didn't teach it well
enough in your system.

00:45:07.572 --> 00:45:10.542 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, people
who aren't visual,

00:45:10.542 --> 00:45:12.977 align:middle line:84%
they'll have their ear
to the teacher listening

00:45:12.977 --> 00:45:14.546 align:middle line:90%
because they're listening 100%.

00:45:14.546 --> 00:45:17.015 align:middle line:84%
And then the teacher will say
they're not paying attention.

00:45:17.015 --> 00:45:18.616 align:middle line:90%
Well, they are paying attention.

00:45:18.616 --> 00:45:19.851 align:middle line:84%
If they were looking
at it, they wouldn't

00:45:19.851 --> 00:45:21.086 align:middle line:90%
be able to pay attention.

00:45:21.086 --> 00:45:23.488 align:middle line:84%
Because they're attempting
to use two systems.

00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:27.092 align:middle line:84%
So it's the teachers who need
the education behind what

00:45:27.092 --> 00:45:28.159 align:middle line:90%
systems the kid's using.

00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:29.928 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I've set a
goal before, and done

00:45:29.928 --> 00:45:31.563 align:middle line:84%
the visualization
around it before.

00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't work out.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:33.398 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: OK.

00:45:33.398 --> 00:45:34.499 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is that
because I need

00:45:34.499 --> 00:45:36.134 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the drawing
board on my processes?

00:45:37.736 --> 00:45:38.937 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And sometimes
it's because your GPS

00:45:38.937 --> 00:45:40.004 align:middle line:84%
is set for the

00:45:40.004 --> 00:45:41.339 align:middle line:90%
thing, the incorrect thing.

00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:42.373 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:42.373 --> 00:45:43.875 align:middle line:84%
Well then, how much does
free will play into?

00:45:43.875 --> 00:45:45.443 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Free will
plays a huge part.

00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:48.379 align:middle line:84%
You can change your whole future
simply by changing your mind,

00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:50.682 align:middle line:84%
changing what you believe and
what you want out of life?

00:45:50.682 --> 00:45:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what if it
involves other people?

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:54.185 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: There you--
that's interesting.

00:45:54.185 --> 00:45:56.121 align:middle line:84%
Because it really needs
to be about yourself

00:45:56.121 --> 00:45:58.156 align:middle line:84%
and how much you can
control of your life.

00:45:58.156 --> 00:46:01.626 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing is
to give your unconscious mind

00:46:01.626 --> 00:46:03.061 align:middle line:90%
really strong instructions.

00:46:03.061 --> 00:46:05.296 align:middle line:84%
And to model someone
else who's done it well.

00:46:05.296 --> 00:46:07.265 align:middle line:84%
If they've done it,
you can do it, too.

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:08.433 align:middle line:90%
Someone's done it.

00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:10.268 align:middle line:84%
Look at Roger Bannister
with the four minute mile.

00:46:10.268 --> 00:46:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Nobody had done the four
minute mile before he did.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.304 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:46:13.304 --> 00:46:14.105 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Within 12
months, lots of people

00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:15.607 align:middle line:90%
had done the four minute mile.

00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:16.941 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because he was a model.

00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:18.776 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Someone simply has
to believe it can be done.

00:46:18.776 --> 00:46:20.078 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody
else can follow.

00:46:20.078 --> 00:46:21.813 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So he changed
everybody's model

00:46:21.813 --> 00:46:23.248 align:middle line:90%
of the four minute mile?

00:46:23.248 --> 00:46:24.149 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:46:24.149 --> 00:46:25.917 align:middle line:84%
He changed the
whole dynamic of it.

00:46:25.917 --> 00:46:27.719 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is it
that you hear the most?

00:46:27.719 --> 00:46:30.455 align:middle line:84%
Wen people come to you, what do
they come to you the most for?

00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:32.056 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Mostly because
they're not happy.

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:34.125 align:middle line:84%
Mostly because they've got
negative emotions in the way.

00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:35.059 align:middle line:90%
They feel trapped.

00:46:35.059 --> 00:46:37.228 align:middle line:90%
They feel depressed.

00:46:37.228 --> 00:46:40.498 align:middle line:84%
I do enjoy dealing with the
really, really-- the big ones.

00:46:40.498 --> 00:46:41.833 align:middle line:90%
Those are my favorite.

00:46:41.833 --> 00:46:44.269 align:middle line:84%
Because those are actually a lot
easier to clear than the ones

00:46:44.269 --> 00:46:45.870 align:middle line:84%
who have got little
bitty things.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.305 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You see
the biggest impact

00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:50.208 align:middle line:84%
with those that are
severely either depressed

00:46:50.208 --> 00:46:51.509 align:middle line:90%
or in a state of trauma?

00:46:51.509 --> 00:46:52.877 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, you can totally
take them out and get them

00:46:52.877 --> 00:46:53.978 align:middle line:90%
on track immediately.

00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:55.513 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many
times does it take?

00:46:55.513 --> 00:46:56.581 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Once or twice.

00:46:56.581 --> 00:46:59.684 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take me--
like once, a big clear.

00:46:59.684 --> 00:47:01.052 align:middle line:84%
Or I think of it
as a garage sale

00:47:01.052 --> 00:47:03.588 align:middle line:84%
for the-- a yard
sale for the mind.

00:47:03.588 --> 00:47:04.822 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:06.724 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And then after a
yard sale, you always go in.

00:47:06.724 --> 00:47:08.259 align:middle line:84%
And you go, oh, look
at that cupboard

00:47:08.259 --> 00:47:09.828 align:middle line:90%
I didn't remember about.

00:47:09.828 --> 00:47:10.929 align:middle line:90%
And that's all it is.

00:47:10.929 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:84%
You come back for a
tuneup visit and clear up

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.466 align:middle line:84%
what your unconscious mind says,
hey, I found another cupboard.

00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:16.401 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Have another yard sale.

00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:17.502 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes, exactly.

00:47:17.502 --> 00:47:19.204 align:middle line:84%
And what I always say,
what we've cleared today,

00:47:19.204 --> 00:47:20.138 align:middle line:90%
we've cleared forever.

00:47:20.138 --> 00:47:21.973 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:47:21.973 --> 00:47:22.841 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:47:22.841 --> 00:47:24.042 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
interesting, yeah.

00:47:24.042 --> 00:47:26.244 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I seem to have
got this real handle

00:47:26.244 --> 00:47:27.912 align:middle line:84%
on clearing things,
which is fabulous.

00:47:27.912 --> 00:47:30.081 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or at the end of a
yard sale, the stuff that

00:47:30.081 --> 00:47:31.950 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been purchased,
you give away.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:34.152 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Straight
to Goodwill, exactly.

00:47:34.152 --> 00:47:36.487 align:middle line:84%
You don't go search it
out and bring it back in.

00:47:36.487 --> 00:47:37.255 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:47:37.255 --> 00:47:37.822 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a good analogy.

00:47:37.822 --> 00:47:38.723 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:47:38.723 --> 00:47:39.791 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, that's
a great analogy.

00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:41.059 align:middle line:84%
All right, well, overwhelmed
is also something

00:47:41.059 --> 00:47:42.393 align:middle line:84%
that many people
find themselves.

00:47:42.393 --> 00:47:43.728 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:47:43.728 --> 00:47:45.363 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Especially In our very
fast-paced world where we just

00:47:45.363 --> 00:47:47.865 align:middle line:84%
topple things on
top of theirselves.

00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:50.335 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: And parents
have a huge hand in that.

00:47:50.335 --> 00:47:52.203 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you only got a B?

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:53.338 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you get a B plus?

00:47:53.338 --> 00:47:54.138 align:middle line:90%
You got a B plus?

00:47:54.138 --> 00:47:55.640 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's so near to an A.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.308 align:middle line:84%
And an A is so
near to an A star.

00:47:57.308 --> 00:47:59.244 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't you get
A star this time?

00:47:59.244 --> 00:48:00.545 align:middle line:90%
You only got an A?

00:48:00.545 --> 00:48:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And we do that not
enough syndrome

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.383 align:middle line:84%
so that the children don't
ever feel like they're proud

00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:07.518 align:middle line:90%
and they can just enjoy it.

00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:10.555 align:middle line:84%
So we set ourselves goals
that are much too high.

00:48:10.555 --> 00:48:13.157 align:middle line:84%
And then immediately,
they don't work.

00:48:13.157 --> 00:48:16.494 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, I have a lady
who had to release 100 pounds.

00:48:16.494 --> 00:48:18.062 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her,
so, I said, what

00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.064 align:middle line:84%
do you-- I want to release
100 pounds, she said.

00:48:20.064 --> 00:48:21.266 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:48:21.266 --> 00:48:23.301 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and how long
do you want to do it in?

00:48:23.301 --> 00:48:25.303 align:middle line:90%
I want to do it in a week.

00:48:25.303 --> 00:48:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In a week?

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.071 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:27.906 align:middle line:90%
That's instant.

00:48:27.906 --> 00:48:28.640 align:middle line:90%
I can do it fast.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.874 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not quite that fast.

00:48:29.874 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how about
can you release one pound?

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.179 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, that's simple.

00:48:35.179 --> 00:48:38.082 align:middle line:84%
And then she said, well,
what if I release two pounds?

00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:40.385 align:middle line:90%
Then you're a pound in bonus.

00:48:40.385 --> 00:48:44.889 align:middle line:84%
With exercise, she said,
I can do an hour a day.

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:46.858 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you don't
want to do an hour a day.

00:48:46.858 --> 00:48:48.259 align:middle line:84%
I said, what would
you like to do?

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:49.460 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to do the gym.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.762 align:middle line:90%
I said, do you like the gym?

00:48:50.762 --> 00:48:53.131 align:middle line:90%
She said, no.

00:48:53.131 --> 00:48:56.034 align:middle line:84%
The body language is disagreeing
with the mouth every time.

00:48:56.034 --> 00:49:00.538 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, could
you do half an hour?

00:49:00.538 --> 00:49:01.706 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:49:01.706 --> 00:49:03.675 align:middle line:90%
Could you do 15 minutes?

00:49:03.675 --> 00:49:04.375 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:05.276 align:middle line:90%
Could you do five minutes?

00:49:05.276 --> 00:49:06.077 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:49:06.077 --> 00:49:07.111 align:middle line:90%
Put the leash on the dog.

00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:07.812 align:middle line:90%
Walk down the road.

00:49:07.812 --> 00:49:08.546 align:middle line:90%
Come back.

00:49:08.546 --> 00:49:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I can do five minutes.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.648 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, that's it.

00:49:10.648 --> 00:49:13.184 align:middle line:84%
You're only allowed to do five
minutes a day from now on.

00:49:13.184 --> 00:49:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, but what if
I do 10 minutes or 15 minutes?

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.455 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Everything
over that is a bonus.

00:49:17.455 --> 00:49:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: And she's like, bonus.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.058 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole thing.

00:49:20.058 --> 00:49:22.126 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you go in
looking for healthy foods

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:23.294 align:middle line:90%
into the supermarket.

00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:24.929 align:middle line:90%
Go look for colors.

00:49:24.929 --> 00:49:26.564 align:middle line:84%
Choose five different
colors of fruits,

00:49:26.564 --> 00:49:27.632 align:middle line:84%
five different
colors of vegetables.

00:49:27.632 --> 00:49:29.000 align:middle line:90%
It's much more fun for the kids.

>>LISA: Right.

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:33.805 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is
especially important

00:49:33.805 --> 00:49:36.574 align:middle line:84%
where it comes to
parenting, and when

00:49:36.574 --> 00:49:39.444 align:middle line:84%
you have employees,

00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:45.083 align:middle line:90%
when they're young?

00:49:45.083 --> 00:49:46.017 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's--

00:49:46.017 --> 00:49:49.854 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: It's
150,000 times plus.

00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:52.323 align:middle line:84%

the parent's trying to teach?

00:49:52.323 --> 00:49:54.258 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: They're attempting
to say, no, don't.

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:54.792 align:middle line:90%
No, don't.

00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:56.294 align:middle line:90%
No, stop.

00:49:56.294 --> 00:49:58.696 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge
is this constant no.

00:49:58.696 --> 00:50:00.865 align:middle line:84%
They did a study in the
US where they actually

00:50:00.865 --> 00:50:04.602 align:middle line:84%
tape recorded in a daycare
nursery how many times

00:50:04.602 --> 00:50:06.471 align:middle line:90%
the caretaker said no.

00:50:06.471 --> 00:50:08.306 align:middle line:84%
And it was literally
90% of the time

00:50:08.306 --> 00:50:09.574 align:middle line:90%

00:50:09.574 --> 00:50:11.075 align:middle line:90%
No, stop.

00:50:11.075 --> 00:50:13.344 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, if you
do this, my sweetheart,

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:16.013 align:middle line:90%
this is going to be the result.

00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:19.517 align:middle line:84%
With my child, I
really, literally,

00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:21.686 align:middle line:84%
didn't say no for the first

>>OSWALD: It was an
interesting exercise.

00:50:24.856 --> 00:50:26.758 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you
create boundaries?

00:50:26.758 --> 00:50:29.026 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I used to say, if
you do this, my sweetheart,

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:29.927 align:middle line:90%
this is the result.

00:50:29.927 --> 00:50:31.696 align:middle line:90%
Think of a different way.

00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:32.797 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:50:32.797 --> 00:50:33.831 align:middle line:84%
I would just teach her,
rather than tell her.

00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:34.932 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a great phrase.

00:50:34.932 --> 00:50:36.367 align:middle line:84%
If you do this, this
will be the result.

00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:37.235 align:middle line:90%
Think of a different way.

00:50:37.235 --> 00:50:38.202 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:39.971 align:middle line:84%
And if she'd done
something, I'd go, OK.

00:50:39.971 --> 00:50:40.705 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:50:40.705 --> 00:50:41.806 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being honest.

00:50:41.806 --> 00:50:45.176 align:middle line:84%
Let's think of how we
can not do that next.

00:50:45.176 --> 00:50:47.912 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you studied
NLP, obviously.

00:50:47.912 --> 00:50:51.382 align:middle line:84%
And then also
hypnotherapy for how long?

00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:54.285 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Gosh, the hypnosis
probably about 15 years,

00:50:54.285 --> 00:50:56.287 align:middle line:90%
the NLP probably about 10.

00:50:56.287 --> 00:50:59.524 align:middle line:84%
Only it took me six years to
do my PhD in clinical hypnosis.

00:50:59.524 --> 00:51:00.858 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because you?

00:51:00.858 --> 00:51:02.994 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Just
because I was working.

00:51:02.994 --> 00:51:04.362 align:middle line:90%
And I had the child.

00:51:04.362 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And I had--

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.231 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, let's talk about
that for a second, though.

00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Because many, many people
want to go back and finish

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.402 align:middle line:84%
their education and
don't have the time.

00:51:11.402 --> 00:51:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:13.805 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how did
you create that?

00:51:13.805 --> 00:51:15.573 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I was just
so keen to do it.

00:51:15.573 --> 00:51:17.141 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was doing
learning anyway.

00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, why don't I get
some qualifications for it?

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:20.978 align:middle line:84%
I'm always going to
be taking learning.

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:23.147 align:middle line:84%
I'm always going to be
taking courses and learning

00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:24.482 align:middle line:90%
more things.

00:51:24.482 --> 00:51:25.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm like a sponge.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:27.618 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoy
listening and thinking.

00:51:27.618 --> 00:51:28.786 align:middle line:90%
So I decided, you know what?

00:51:28.786 --> 00:51:31.322 align:middle line:84%
I want to be the
best that I can be.

00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:33.691 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so you went and
you sought after your PhD?

00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:34.625 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And at what
time-- I mean, it

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.162 align:middle line:90%
was after you had children?

00:51:38.162 --> 00:51:38.796 align:middle line:90%
Later in life?

00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: I had Katie.

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:41.766 align:middle line:84%
She was about eight
when I started.

00:51:41.766 --> 00:51:44.802 align:middle line:84%
So it was once a month I'd
have to have this paper in.

00:51:44.802 --> 00:51:46.637 align:middle line:84%
And at midnight on the
last day of the month

00:51:46.637 --> 00:51:47.972 align:middle line:90%
I'd be sitting there like this.

00:51:47.972 --> 00:51:49.307 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:49.307 --> 00:51:50.708 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Because no matter
how much time during the month,

00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:52.777 align:middle line:84%
you're always going to do
it that last two hours.

00:51:52.777 --> 00:51:53.878 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You didn't work on
yourself with procrastination?

00:51:53.878 --> 00:51:54.512 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:51:54.512 --> 00:51:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.015 align:middle line:84%
You know, it gives
you inspiration.

00:51:58.015 --> 00:52:00.184 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
timeline to work with,

00:52:00.184 --> 00:52:02.153 align:middle line:84%
it gives you inspiration
to just do it then.

00:52:02.153 --> 00:52:03.454 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:52:03.454 --> 00:52:05.756 align:middle line:84%
Did we say anything
about procrastination

00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:08.426 align:middle line:90%
and how to reverse it?

00:52:08.426 --> 00:52:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.328 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How do we do this?

00:52:10.328 --> 00:52:11.929 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Literally,
what I could

00:52:11.929 --> 00:52:14.565 align:middle line:84%
have done-- because I didn't
know NLP then fully enough.

00:52:14.565 --> 00:52:16.834 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't really studied
it a great deal.

00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:19.337 align:middle line:84%
Is what I could have
done is seen myself

00:52:19.337 --> 00:52:23.174 align:middle line:84%
on the 28th of every
month doing the send.

00:52:23.174 --> 00:52:25.009 align:middle line:84%
And then it probably
would've been the 29th.

00:52:25.009 --> 00:52:27.178 align:middle line:84%
However, it would have
still gone earlier.

00:52:27.178 --> 00:52:28.446 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All night on the 29th.

00:52:28.446 --> 00:52:30.848 align:middle line:84%
But you still-- so you
could back up your date.

00:52:30.848 --> 00:52:31.782 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: You can back up
the date, yeah, exactly.

00:52:31.782 --> 00:52:32.383 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:52:32.383 --> 00:52:33.751 align:middle line:90%
What about lateness?

00:52:33.751 --> 00:52:34.819 align:middle line:90%
Can you rewind that?

00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:37.688 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Lateness is
usually a control thing.

00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:39.524 align:middle line:84%
It's like I want to
control my universe.

00:52:39.524 --> 00:52:41.225 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the only
way I can control it

00:52:41.225 --> 00:52:44.862 align:middle line:84%
is by making sure that
everybody is waiting for me.

00:52:44.862 --> 00:52:45.930 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of interesting.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:46.797 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To make
the grand entrance?

00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:47.999 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes, exactly.

00:52:47.999 --> 00:52:50.201 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I apologize I'm late.

00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:52.737 align:middle line:84%
And I used to do it a lot
until I realized I did it.

00:52:52.737 --> 00:52:53.871 align:middle line:90%
And then I was like, wow.

00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:56.507 align:middle line:84%
That's really not a good
way to get attention.

00:52:56.507 --> 00:52:58.142 align:middle line:84%
Remember that as a
child, the one thing

00:52:58.142 --> 00:53:00.011 align:middle line:84%
we have to have is
attention or we die.

00:53:00.011 --> 00:53:01.712 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:53:01.712 --> 00:53:05.249 align:middle line:84%
So we're programmed
internally, deep wired,

00:53:05.249 --> 00:53:07.652 align:middle line:84%
to get that attention,
to get that recognition.

00:53:07.652 --> 00:53:09.654 align:middle line:90%
Or else we may not get through.

00:53:09.654 --> 00:53:11.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Back to
the limbic system,

00:53:11.055 --> 00:53:12.356 align:middle line:90%
back to the survival brain.

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:14.292 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Back to Maslow's
hierarchy of needs,

00:53:14.292 --> 00:53:16.193 align:middle line:84%
where we have to get
our physical needs met,

00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:19.730 align:middle line:84%
our emotional needs met, our
recognition and attention needs

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:20.665 align:middle line:90%
met.

00:53:20.665 --> 00:53:22.366 align:middle line:84%
And once we've got
all those, then we

00:53:22.366 --> 00:53:24.402 align:middle line:90%
can work with the higher values.

00:53:24.402 --> 00:53:27.438 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you do
anything in terms of hypnosis

00:53:27.438 --> 00:53:30.775 align:middle line:84%
to address the survivalist
qualities of our life?

00:53:30.775 --> 00:53:31.576 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Always.

00:53:31.576 --> 00:53:33.277 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is that where you start?

00:53:33.277 --> 00:53:35.246 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I start
with the three pages.

00:53:35.246 --> 00:53:37.548 align:middle line:84%
And then I say,
literally, I believe

00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:40.084 align:middle line:84%
everything's done the first
seven years, even phobias.

00:53:40.084 --> 00:53:41.719 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to
rewind all of that.

00:53:41.719 --> 00:53:44.355 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: No, you just simply
go back to the little child

00:53:44.355 --> 00:53:45.923 align:middle line:84%
and give them the
gifts back that they

00:53:45.923 --> 00:53:47.592 align:middle line:84%
never-- if you actually
align them back

00:53:47.592 --> 00:53:49.827 align:middle line:84%
with the perfect blueprint
of perfect health, and joy,

00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:51.996 align:middle line:84%
and freedom from before
they were conceived

00:53:51.996 --> 00:53:53.664 align:middle line:84%
and just white light
the whole thing,

00:53:53.664 --> 00:53:55.366 align:middle line:90%
it completely clears everything.

00:53:55.366 --> 00:53:57.368 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
fears of-- phobias?

00:53:57.368 --> 00:53:59.303 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned fear of
drowning, or spiders,

00:53:59.303 --> 00:54:00.504 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:01.806 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Phobias are the
easiest thing in the world.

00:54:01.806 --> 00:54:02.873 align:middle line:90%
It takes two minutes.

00:54:02.873 --> 00:54:05.209 align:middle line:84%
I did it on a radio show
a couple of years ago.

00:54:05.209 --> 00:54:08.212 align:middle line:84%
And literally everyone was
like this with their phobias.

00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:09.480 align:middle line:90%
It's fabulous.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.882 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In terms of the
technique that you did with me?

00:54:11.882 --> 00:54:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:13.751 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So are you
overlaying something

00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:15.453 align:middle line:84%
positive over a
negative experience?

00:54:15.453 --> 00:54:17.521 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Nope, you're
just releasing the emotion.

00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:20.891 align:middle line:84%
Just before you have that
phobia come up, you were fine.

00:54:20.891 --> 00:54:22.593 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lady who
was afraid of snakes.

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:24.228 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't even
say the word snakes.

00:54:24.228 --> 00:54:26.831 align:middle line:84%
She was like, those things
in the garden that wriggle.

00:54:26.831 --> 00:54:28.065 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I can't
go in the garden.

00:54:28.065 --> 00:54:28.833 align:middle line:90%
I live in Florida.

00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:30.501 align:middle line:90%
She said, this is not funny.

00:54:30.501 --> 00:54:32.103 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her,
when do you remember

00:54:32.103 --> 00:54:33.104 align:middle line:90%
being afraid of snakes?

00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:34.572 align:middle line:90%
She said, I have no idea.

00:54:34.572 --> 00:54:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.775 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you think you were
afraid when you were born?

00:54:37.775 --> 00:54:38.943 align:middle line:90%
She said, no.

00:54:38.943 --> 00:54:40.511 align:middle line:84%
So I said, let's go back
to when you were born then.

00:54:40.511 --> 00:54:43.648 align:middle line:84%
Watch the film of you watching
yourself from the projector.

00:54:43.648 --> 00:54:47.084 align:middle line:84%
Watching the film from
when you were born to now.

00:54:47.084 --> 00:54:47.718 align:middle line:90%
White light it.

00:54:47.718 --> 00:54:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Black white it.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.289 align:middle line:84%
And when the film
became neutral,

00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:53.891 align:middle line:84%
she just said,
that's ridiculous.

00:54:53.891 --> 00:54:56.027 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't know why
I was afraid of snakes.

00:54:56.027 --> 00:54:57.061 align:middle line:90%
She said, I can go on.

00:54:57.061 --> 00:54:58.362 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you
make the film neutral?

00:54:58.362 --> 00:55:00.464 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: You literally-- it's
called a double dissociation

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:00.965 align:middle line:90%
method.

00:55:00.965 --> 00:55:02.133 align:middle line:90%
It's pure NLP.

00:55:02.133 --> 00:55:04.869 align:middle line:84%
You literally see yourself
watching yourself watching

00:55:04.869 --> 00:55:08.272 align:middle line:84%
the film, great for post
traumatic stress as well.

00:55:08.272 --> 00:55:10.374 align:middle line:84%
And from this
perspective, you can't

00:55:10.374 --> 00:55:12.243 align:middle line:90%
be connected with that emotion.

00:55:12.243 --> 00:55:15.112 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally in--
using your prefrontal cortex.

00:55:15.112 --> 00:55:18.849 align:middle line:84%
And you literally watch
it forward in color,

00:55:18.849 --> 00:55:21.052 align:middle line:84%
back in color, forward
in black and white.

00:55:21.052 --> 00:55:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And you black and
white the whole thing.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.388 align:middle line:90%
You whitewash it.

00:55:24.388 --> 00:55:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And before you
know it, the brain

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.727 align:middle line:84%
can't comprehend anything
to do with that emotion.

00:55:29.727 --> 00:55:31.095 align:middle line:90%
And just deletes the file.

00:55:31.095 --> 00:55:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So that's interesting.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:33.898 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: It's really easy.

00:55:33.898 --> 00:55:36.000 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do behavioral
therapy and expose them to it.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.335 align:middle line:90%
You just delete it.

00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:39.537 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It sounds too easy.

00:55:39.537 --> 00:55:40.838 align:middle line:90%
But I had that.

00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:43.140 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I used
to walk out my front door

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.744 align:middle line:84%
on the way to school half asleep
and run into gigantic spiders

00:55:46.744 --> 00:55:48.746 align:middle line:90%
with very, very strong webs.

00:55:48.746 --> 00:55:51.348 align:middle line:90%
And I remember this situation.

00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:54.552 align:middle line:84%
My brother and I both, to this
day, cannot stand spiders.

00:55:54.552 --> 00:55:58.723 align:middle line:84%
So I could go back, look at us
before we walk out half asleep,

00:55:58.723 --> 00:56:00.825 align:middle line:90%
and rewind the situation.

00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:02.727 align:middle line:90%
But don't get to the spider?

00:56:02.727 --> 00:56:04.962 align:middle line:90%
Do it right before that?

00:56:04.962 --> 00:56:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: You just
watch yourself

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:07.732 align:middle line:84%
going through the
spider web and back.

00:56:07.732 --> 00:56:08.766 align:middle line:90%
And watch it backwards.

00:56:08.766 --> 00:56:09.600 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.668 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:56:10.668 --> 00:56:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: You don't
have to-- and the thing

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:14.505 align:middle line:84%
is, nobody particularly
likes spiders.

00:56:14.505 --> 00:56:16.507 align:middle line:84%
Having a huge fear of
them is a phobia though.

00:56:16.507 --> 00:56:17.475 align:middle line:90%
So you want to clear it.

00:56:17.475 --> 00:56:18.943 align:middle line:90%
It's an inappropriate response.

00:56:18.943 --> 00:56:21.145 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I mean, I
recognize during-- you know,

00:56:21.145 --> 00:56:23.547 align:middle line:84%
whenever you see a scary
thing, they put spiders on it.

00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:24.949 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very common fear.

00:56:24.949 --> 00:56:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, they do.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:27.118 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:56:27.118 --> 00:56:28.486 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it
scares most people.

00:56:28.486 --> 00:56:29.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not just--

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.488 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Exactly.

00:56:30.488 --> 00:56:32.957 align:middle line:84%
And going to see scary movies
is really healthy for you.

00:56:32.957 --> 00:56:36.227 align:middle line:84%
Because it allows you to
clear fear from your body

00:56:36.227 --> 00:56:38.162 align:middle line:84%
that would otherwise
have been stuck there.

00:56:38.162 --> 00:56:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:41.232 align:middle line:84%
I've never looked at scary
movies as a healthy thing

00:56:41.232 --> 00:56:42.433 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:56:42.433 --> 00:56:43.367 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Yes, it is actually,
if you've got the fears.

00:56:43.367 --> 00:56:44.935 align:middle line:84%
It's not if you've
not got the fears.

00:56:44.935 --> 00:56:46.937 align:middle line:84%
Because then it's just
going to light fears.

00:56:46.937 --> 00:56:48.339 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:56:48.339 --> 00:56:50.174 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: Like I
love roller coasters.

00:56:50.174 --> 00:56:52.209 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply the
excitement of the roller

00:56:52.209 --> 00:56:54.145 align:middle line:84%
coasters boosts
my immune system.

00:56:54.145 --> 00:56:56.413 align:middle line:84%
So put me on a roller
coaster, I love it.

00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:57.748 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You do?

00:56:57.748 --> 00:56:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: I wouldn't enjoy a
scary movie these days, though.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.385 align:middle line:84%
That would make
me think of things

00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:02.586 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't want to think of.

00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:04.355 align:middle line:84%
When I was a teenager,
I used to love it.

00:57:04.355 --> 00:57:06.157 align:middle line:84%
Because I had a lot
of fear as a teenager.

00:57:06.157 --> 00:57:07.491 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now you've
gotten over that?

00:57:07.491 --> 00:57:08.425 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I have no need to
go to a scary movie.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.296 align:middle line:90%
Why would I do that to myself?

00:57:12.296 --> 00:57:14.431 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not that you're
avoiding it or anything.

00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:14.965 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: No.

00:57:14.965 --> 00:57:16.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.235 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's like, I have
a really good imagination.

00:57:18.235 --> 00:57:19.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't need that, thank you.

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:21.272 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, very good.

00:57:21.272 --> 00:57:23.073 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:57:23.073 --> 00:57:25.009 align:middle line:84%
The book is called
"Every Word Has Power."

00:57:25.009 --> 00:57:25.976 align:middle line:84%
>>OSWALD: "Every
Word Has Power."

00:57:25.976 --> 00:57:26.977 align:middle line:90%
It's in 10 languages now.

00:57:26.977 --> 00:57:27.511 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 10 languages?

00:57:27.511 --> 00:57:28.045 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:29.079 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah.

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:30.548 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And a lot of
exercises in the book,

00:57:30.548 --> 00:57:31.849 align:middle line:90%
as we have seen, on the videos.

00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:32.817 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yes, a lot.

00:57:32.817 --> 00:57:34.451 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A lot of great
videos on YouTube

00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:36.687 align:middle line:84%
as well to do
exercises with you.

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:37.755 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Yeah, wonderful.

00:57:37.755 --> 00:57:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much, Lisa.

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.824 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:57:39.824 --> 00:57:40.658 align:middle line:90%
Thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:57:40.658 --> 00:57:41.525 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:57:41.525 --> 00:57:42.026 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:57:42.026 --> 00:57:42.693 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Good.

00:57:42.693 --> 00:57:44.161 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: As you would say.

00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:45.396 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Do I say that a lot?

00:57:45.396 --> 00:57:45.963 align:middle line:90%
I probably do.

00:57:45.963 --> 00:57:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well done.

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:48.632 align:middle line:90%
No, I put it in the positive.

00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:49.533 align:middle line:90%
>>OSWALD: Thank you.

00:57:49.533 --> 00:57:50.434 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:57:50.434 --> 00:57:51.535 align:middle line:84%
Your language has
improved actually.

00:57:51.535 --> 00:57:52.937 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:57:52.937 --> 00:57:55.406 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you would like to
