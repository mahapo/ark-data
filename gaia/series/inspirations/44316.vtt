>>SUSAN MILLER: Hello.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.917 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to be
here and to see you.

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness gracious.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So tell me how long have
you been studying astrology?

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, when I was
little my mother had textbooks

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:90%
around the house.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
You know so when I was maybe
12 or 13, that's usually

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.475 align:middle line:84%
an age when people want to
know more about themselves.

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But then I
got very, very sick.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.664 align:middle line:90%
I had a birth defect from birth.

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors didn't
know what it was.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.829 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't
know what it was,

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
they assumed it was
either psychosomatic,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:90%
or I had made it up.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.446 align:middle line:84%
And they would actually be very
mean to me and very accusatory

00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But I would get an
attack once a year.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
It would feel like something
thick like chocolate syrup

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.287 align:middle line:84%
was falling in my knee,
and hip, and thigh.

00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I'd get an
attack, I couldn't

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:90%
move an inch in the bed.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:84%
My mother would have to put
the sheets under me very, very,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
very slowly because we
couldn't take any jarring,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and then pull out the one sheet,
and then put in the new sheet.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:90%
And it would take about an hour.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.946 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long
would that last?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It would be
six to eight weeks.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
swollen, and no one

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
could see me because I lived
in a walk up in Manhattan.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was on the second floor.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't go to the family
table to have dinner.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move from that bed.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even get in
a different position.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't turn.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do anything.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors are
saying I made it up.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And my mother knew that no
child is going to be that still.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.060 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
my little sister

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
would skip and, you
know, cause vibrations.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And we had to put up a sign,
walk slowly and quietly

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:90%
near the bed.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this started
around your teens?

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: No, it started from
birth, but I couldn't talk.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, who is
an astrologer, or was--

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:90%
I just lost her last year.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.339 align:middle line:84%
Mmm, it's so hard
to lose your mother.

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But she said
Susan, when you're 14,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:90%
this will go away.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe you'll outgrow it.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking mmm, this
is severe, whatever it is.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:90%
You know, but I loved her.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.284 align:middle line:84%
And if she said it would
go away, I'll go with that.

00:02:59.284 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You wanted
to believe her.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.325 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And I got such a bad attack
when I was 13 and 11 months.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
We were waiting, and
it wasn't going away.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.542 align:middle line:84%
I got my attack in
January, January 28th.

00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:13.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it would just
come on all of a sudden.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.041 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: All of
a sudden, I would

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
feel a volume of
liquid falling down.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And everything would
go like this inside me.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.673 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was
having an attack.

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:90%
So I couldn't travel very much.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even go on
trips with my Girl Scout--

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or school.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Troop, or, no.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't even
let me participate

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
in Mapo Day or any
of those things.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
I had to sit on the side
with the delinquent children,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:90%
they would call it.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And this was terrible because I
felt like a little black sheep.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I went to the hospital
in an ambulance.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
The first doctor we tried put me
in traction and made it worse.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
time I'd ever been

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
able to understand
why anyone would

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:84%
want to commit
suicide from pain.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:90%
And this was the worst.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
My father signed me out,
carried me out, brought me home.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And it was now February.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And my mother said you
have to try another doctor.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like no.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:90%
She said we have to.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep being out of
school six to eight weeks.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It would happen once a year,
sometimes twice, but very

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:84%
rarely, and usually
on a holiday.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And she said what kind of--
like my birthday, or Christmas,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.185 align:middle line:84%
or Easter, or when I
was excited and happy.

00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Just being happy.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.096 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Chief of Staff of
the Hospital for Children's

00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:34.276 align:middle line:84%
Diseases, who treated
me kindly, and put me

00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital for
a week, and gently

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
studied me, and after a week,
said we can't figure this out.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
We have to go in.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:84%
They went in, and
they couldn't get out.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I was bleeding internally
at the most horrific rate.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I had veins and arteries
that would turn completely

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.550 align:middle line:90%
to tissue paper and disappear.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
But because it was
happening in the leg,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:90%
the body would compress it.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
If it were happening in
your stomach or your lungs,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:90%
nothing would stop it.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.317 align:middle line:84%
So all those people
lost their life.

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And they'd
never saw it in the leg.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
hospital 11 months.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.992 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my god.

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well,
what they had to do

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
was paralyze me
from the knee down.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:84%
They put such strong
bands around me

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:90%
that it would stop the bleeding.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And they had a conference right
in the operating room that day.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't find that
out until just recently.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And he named the
doctors, and I said

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.112 align:middle line:84%
they're on the
names of buildings.

00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:90%
He said oh, yeah.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.956 align:middle line:90%
You had the best.

00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But we knew it was going
to damage the nerve,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't have
much of a choice.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.131 align:middle line:84%
You would either lose your
life or lose your leg.

00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And we had to do it.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So I woke up, and I
couldn't feel anything.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.301 align:middle line:90%
They put a little pin on you.

00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And he said don't worry.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:90%
We'll worry about that.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:90%
You're young, you're 14.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
We'll do that after we get
done with just the blood

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:84%
supply because they
had taken out so much,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.246 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't moving
properly through my body.

00:05:54.246 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Was there
any reason why?

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Was it a virus?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Was it--

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.338 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: No, no.

00:05:57.338 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:90%
I was born malformed.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Just-- OK.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I never
attended high school.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:90%
I did home study.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:84%
The board of ed has a
program for kids like this.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it isn't like
we had to figure it out.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But they can only send a
teacher for two hours a week,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%
one for Math and
one for English.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I said I don't need English.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I need the math.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Teaching yourself trigonometry
and things like that are hard.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So the board of ed
said that was OK.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.076 align:middle line:84%
I took my regions, my
PSATs, my SATs all at home.

00:06:25.076 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.502 align:middle line:90%
The teacher will say pencils up.

00:06:27.502 --> 00:06:30.049 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like I don't think we--

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who are you talking to?

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:90%
It's just me.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:90%
We can calm down a little.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:90%
She had the stop watch.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.132 align:middle line:90%
I mean, oh my gosh.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But somehow I got
through all that.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And then I went to NYU at 16.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
See, I had skipped
the eighth grade.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So people always say
very obvious things

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
when you're in a crisis,
like oh, you had that year.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had worked really
hard to skip that year.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said no, I'm
going to save that year.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.616 align:middle line:90%
I am not going to not study.

00:07:00.616 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take my
tests and go to college.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.162 align:middle line:84%
So I entered college at
16 and graduated at 20.

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:90%
All--

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.736 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And my
father said to me

00:07:07.736 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
when this health
nightmare is over,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.344 align:middle line:90%
you're going to need a job.

00:07:10.344 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said you're right, Daddy.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:90%
You can say that again.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said well, why
don't you major in business

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:90%
because you'll always work.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:90%
We have a very practical family.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And so I said OK.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I did.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have a
very incredible family.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But it was very
hard to make friends.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.928 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:07:27.928 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Because there
were all men in my class.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And no one would give
me their phone number.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So I thought well,
I'll run for office.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
They'll have to at
least talk to me.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.495 align:middle line:84%
And I found the only job that
nobody wanted was Treasurer.

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.953 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I'm like well,
I'm good with math.

00:07:41.953 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'd stand in front of the
elevator with my platform.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Vote for me, vote
for me, vote for me.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.971 align:middle line:84%
And people would say oh,
that's a pretty good platform.

00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm like well, if you
have any ideas, tell me.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.764 align:middle line:90%
And I kept winning.

00:07:51.764 --> 00:07:52.264 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:07:52.264 --> 00:07:53.566 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, how funny.

00:07:53.566 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And when I graduated,
they picked seven students

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
as the Best for
Service in the school.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of them, The Hall
of Fame of Student Service,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:84%
but it was only
because I wouldn't

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
have had a friend
if I didn't do it.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:90%
It was that way.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So did your leg
heal, and were you able to--

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yes, it's still weak.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:90%
It's still weak.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard for me
to wear high heels now,

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:90%
where I used to be able to.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.302 align:middle line:90%
There's a bone under my in-step.

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I said where did that come
from I said to the doctor.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:84%
He said well, that
bone belongs over here.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.757 align:middle line:90%
It should not be there.

00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea
how you're walking.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm like I am fine.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
He said everything
about you is different.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
OK well I'm glad to
hear that, but we're not

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:90%
going to operate on that leg.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you have had
to go against all odds

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.513 align:middle line:84%
to really make just things
happen that most people take

00:08:42.513 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:90%
for granted every day.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.012 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Just to
walk across the room

00:08:45.012 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
because after you've had
any kind of vascular,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
they put you on a tilt table
to get used to being upright

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.677 align:middle line:90%
because you've been laying.

00:08:53.677 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Circulation?

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.412 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And then they
put you on parallel bars.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you're back in
surgery, so you're back

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:90%
on the tilt table.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So just walking across the room
felt like going to Arizona.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And you have to depend on
people to give you things

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that you-- and I had no
TV in my room and no phone

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:84%
because the thinking was Susan
will get up on crutches--

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.934 align:middle line:84%
and I had a brace up
to my hip-- and she'll

00:09:15.934 --> 00:09:16.850 align:middle line:90%
walk around the house.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But that didn't quite happen
because I was in a lot of pain.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:90%
So I read.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.160 align:middle line:84%
My mother went to the
library, and the librarian

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
would pick out classics
for me to read.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:90%
And I had no distractions.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And I never majored in English,
so I didn't know I could write.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.765 align:middle line:90%
My heart led me.

00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But I was not going to tell
anyone I knew astrology.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Actually, my mother
refused to teach me.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.357 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You just did it for fun?

00:09:43.357 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, see,
I asked my mother

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to teach me because I wanted
to know if I'd ever walk again.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
motivating reason.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And she
wouldn't teach me.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And I said why?

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:90%
You're an astrologer.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.586 align:middle line:84%
And she'd never have
people over at the house.

00:09:56.586 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
It was like she was a scholar
where she would constantly

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
read.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And she also did a
correspondence class

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:09.257 align:middle line:84%
with this esteemed institute
that would correct her answers

00:10:09.257 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle line:90%
and send back.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.765 align:middle line:84%
I have some of the
little books that she--

00:10:11.765 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:84%
she did those way
before I was born.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And was she
doing that as a living

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:90%
or to supplement income?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.285 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: No, no, no.

00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
She was a governess,
like in "Downton Abbey,"

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
like a governess, like
the very wealthy families.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:84%
No, her sister made
her go into it.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
When my mother moved away
from their little town

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.265 align:middle line:90%
where they grew up--

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.558 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: My mother said
I'm going to New York.

00:10:31.558 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:90%
And my aunt said no, you can't.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And she said I'm going.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, why don't
we take a class together

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
so we could talk on the
phone about our homework?

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.155 align:middle line:84%
So my mother, being a Gemini,
said ah, that's a great idea.

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:90%
What are we studying?

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.529 align:middle line:90%
Astrology.

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:46.016 align:middle line:84%
She said, you've
got to be kidding.

00:10:46.016 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.315 align:middle line:84%
And she said you're good
with math, and I'm not.

00:10:50.315 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
My mother is, you know, the
German side of my family.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And my mother really
got that precision.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.835 align:middle line:84%
So my mother loved her sister,
and I wasn't even born yet.

00:10:59.835 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:90%
She said OK, I'll do the charts.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you
it doesn't work.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good point that w--

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, interesting.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.481 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Right at
that moment to say

00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that no astrologer believes
in astrology before they

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.924 align:middle line:90%
study astrology.

00:11:10.924 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Then why
do they study it?

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.673 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Nobody believes in it.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.344 align:middle line:90%
Well, somehow somebody gets--

00:11:15.344 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Curious.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: You into it, or you
delve into it a little bit.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I think anyone who reads me
can see I'm very transparent.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Anything I say, you
can look up in a book.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
I hopefully say
it in a poetic way

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
so that it's
entertaining while you're

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:84%
reading, not dry
like an encyclopedia.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, my mother
refused to teach me.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And for about a year and
1/2, I kept begging her.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And then one day she came in
the living room with a magazine,

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and she said did you
write to this magazine?

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I did.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
How do mothers
know these things?

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, but they
never answered me.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:90%
That was seven months ago.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.895 align:middle line:84%
And she said somebody
with your birthday

00:11:56.895 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and your leg problem
is in the latest issue.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:90%
I think it's you.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like what
did the lady say?

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It was the Editor in Chief.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And she said well,
let's read it together.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:90%
I haven't read it yet.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And the editor
sounded very positive.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Now that's another good
point to think about.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:84%
There are no definites
in astrology.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You put together the
evidence you're finding.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.327 align:middle line:84%
Great family support,
great attitude--

00:12:22.327 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Esteemed doctor.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was
born with Jupiter

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and the success of
health, which Jupiter

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is the giver of gifts and luck
and the planet of miracles.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So that also is part
of the equation.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.414 align:middle line:84%
So my mother read
it to me, and I

00:12:36.414 --> 00:12:38.955 align:middle line:84%
said but there's some terms she
used that I don't understand.

00:12:38.955 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And I need to know those
astrological terms.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.250 align:middle line:90%
She said why?

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:90%
You have your answer.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at her.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like-- she said oh, no.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
You're going to check
the Editor in Chief.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.605 align:middle line:90%
I'm like yes.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
She said why didn't
you just ask me?

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And I have the
most happy mother--

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.419 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: On the planet.

00:12:58.419 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:84%
There is no mountain too
high, no river too wide,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:90%
no ocean too deep to get across.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I said you
would never say

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:90%
to me I could never walk again.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Even if it were
true, you would never

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:84%
say that because there was
always a chance I would.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:90%
And she said that's true.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me a big
hug and she laughed.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And so she began
teaching me, but she

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
said you must
study for 12 years.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:90%
And you're only 15.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know what 12
years are because I'm now

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:84%
15 and 1/2 by the
time she's relenting.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
She says you're not to read
for anyone outside the family

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:90%
until I tell you you're ready.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And we will talk
about astrology,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:84%
but we will also talk
about philosophy.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Why did these things happen?

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about the meaning of life

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and different things
in a discussion.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're also going to
study clear communication

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.786 align:middle line:84%
because if you say the wrong
thing, that's just terrible.

00:13:50.786 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you say the right
thing the wrong way,

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
it's just as bad because
that person may never

00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
meet another astrologer again
to get that straightened out.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.854 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So she was your teacher?

00:14:01.854 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Yes, and the other
side of my family is Italian.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And we lived in a brownstone
that was owned by the family.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And all seven sisters or
brothers lived in the building.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so you got
to read all day long.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.295 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I had
plenty of people.

00:14:13.295 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was like OK,
do me, you know?

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.115 align:middle line:84%
And she would always be there
because I couldn't walk.

00:14:19.115 --> 00:14:20.825 align:middle line:90%
I was home.

00:14:20.825 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have gone,
I mean, against all odds

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
to create the most
magnificent situation.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.369 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at you-- 6 and 1/2
million unique viewers a month.

00:14:31.369 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't just create
that overnight.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.494 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well,
actually I was never

00:14:35.494 --> 00:14:37.077 align:middle line:84%
going to tell anyone
I knew astrology,

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
but when I was little,
when I was 9 or 10,

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I said what will I
be when I grow up?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.585 align:middle line:84%
She said well, you're going
to write for a profession.

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm like nobody in
our family writes.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.824 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, at
ten I said I don't

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
like writing these
essays in school what

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.984 align:middle line:84%
I did over my Christmas
vacation or whatever.

00:14:55.984 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:84%
She said I don't know
what you'll write about,

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
but we better work
on your grammar.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But then when you get a
little bit older, late '30s,

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
early '40s, you have
Aquarius on the mid-heaven.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I have Gemini rising, and
some newly-invented form

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
of communication-- so new,
we don't know the name of it

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:84%
yet-- will change
the way you work

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and be the channel in which you
make your ultimate contribution

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I will never forget
her saying that.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.807 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: And I'm like whoa.

00:15:27.807 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:84%
How do you know it's
not invented yet?

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.191 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius is what comes next.

00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, I drove her crazy.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
She said look, my
generation was television.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And I believe you will be on TV.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a show with
Comcast for four years,

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
but there's other things
coming into the picture.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
She said I think
it's something newer.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And because it's Aquarius,
and the symbol for Aquarius

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
is the little zigzags, the
little rickrack kind of thing,

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:90%
she said it's an air sign.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is, they're
little dots or lines

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.157 align:middle line:84%
that go through the air,
but they're invisible.

00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she taught
you western astrology?

00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.739 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh, yes.

00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's a combination
of math and geometry.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: You're looking at--
yes, I'm doing geometry all day

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.197 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine a planet
is a little person.

00:16:09.197 --> 00:16:10.530 align:middle line:90%
They're walking down the street.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Not much happens alone.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
You can do a lot
alone, but things

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:84%
start happening when
you start talking

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to another person, or three
people, or four people.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.480 align:middle line:84%
When there's an aspect,
that means a communication

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.130 align:middle line:84%
within a certain amount of
degrees with another planet,

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:90%
things start bubbling up.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:84%
They can be a
happy conversation,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
it could be an
opportunity, or it

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:84%
could be something
constricting where

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:84%
you need to watch for
this because you may need

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.610 align:middle line:84%
to fix something
when that comes up.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:90%
And I can see both.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How does that affect
us walking on this Earth?

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.483 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Oh, why
does astrology work?

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, planets,
communications, and aspects

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.455 align:middle line:84%
happen up above in the
cosmos, and they affect us

00:16:52.455 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:90%
on this planet?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: As above,
so, too, below

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
in a fractal relationship,
yes, on a smaller scale.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.266 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And depending on
when you came in--now,

00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:03.605 align:middle line:84%
do you believe that when
you come into this planet,

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and when you're born
you are printed,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:90%
you have a birth print of your--

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Your chart
will never change,

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:84%
but you do have a progressed
chart, which we progress it

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
for every year
that you're alive.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:84%
But the natal chart
is everything.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And an astrologer needs a day,
month, year, time of birth,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:90%
and city of birth.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Now that's for a custom chart.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Once you know your
rising sign, you

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
must read for that sign
for the rest of your life,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:90%
along with your sun's sign.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And the sun sign is
really just putting

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
the sun on the
horizon line of Earth.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Your rising sign is what sign
was coming up in the East,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
right on the eastern
horizon where

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.025 align:middle line:90%
the sun comes up at dawn--

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: When you were born?

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: When you were born.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:84%
People who are
born at dawn, have

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:90%
the exact same rising sign.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, I was
wondering about that.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But
remember, dawn changes

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:90%
in the winter versus the summer.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, it doesn't always
come up at the same time.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.797 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there any themes
that apply to all people, like,

00:18:06.797 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:84%
as you said, people that are
born in the morning, people

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:84%
that are born in the evening
tend to be certain ways?

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.446 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Oh, well, there
is something I've noticed.

00:18:13.446 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And there was
some theories about it.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:90%
But now I'm seeing it's true.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.351 align:middle line:90%
If you are born at night--

00:18:20.351 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Your moon takes
on special significance

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
because the moon
comes out at night.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: In
astrology, the moon is

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
your fine-tuning
to your character.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:90%
And the sun is what you see.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Now western astrology puts
tremendous emphasis on the sun.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But vedic
astrology in India

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.630 align:middle line:90%
puts more emphasis on the moon.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.225 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:18:41.225 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's what your inner--

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But you know,
my daughter is engaged.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And she's marrying Leo
Fitzpatrick, the actor.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:90%
And he's a Leo.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.414 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:18:53.414 --> 00:18:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were calling him
Leo because that was his sign.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It's so funny
that one of my children

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
would be marrying someone with
the name of a sign, right?

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is great.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:90%
No accidents.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It was
so cute on Twitter.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I tweet a lot on
@astrologyzone because there

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.356 align:middle line:84%
are too many Susan Millers, so
my handle is @astrologyzone.

00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote, you
know, I'm so excited.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
My daughter got
engagement, and I love him.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And somebody wrote
I looked him up.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Little Leo is a little Leo.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:90%
He is.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It was so funny.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:90%
They used my lexicon.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I noticed
that she's a Pisces.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And usually, Pisces and Leo
might not be a perfect match.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But I always believe anybody
can get along with anyone else.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But she has the
moon in Aquarius,

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and she has a lot
of Aquarian planets.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Uh-huh, and that
makes a difference--

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Aquarius
and Leo, perfect.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mmm.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's why--

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I see that
these evening babies,

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
after the sun goes down--
if you are an evening baby,

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:90%
find out the sign of your moon.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And just watch to see
the type of people

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:90%
you seem to blend best with.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And it might be the moon
that is driving that.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And your moon is your emotions,
how you looked at your mother,

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:90%
or your memories.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And Venus is emotion,
too, but the moon

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:84%
is your memories, and your
psychological outlook,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:90%
and what your family gave you.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when people
ask you to give a reading

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:84%
or to do their chart,
what is it that they're

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:90%
looking for the most?

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Are they usually
looking for love?

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.086 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Oh, my number
one question right now

00:20:22.086 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
is something astrology
can't help them with.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I forgot to have a
baby, and I'm now 42.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
If I had a dollar
for every woman who's

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
sat with a handkerchief
crying, and it's heartbreaking.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:90%
And the media is not helping.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Childbearing is for
when you're younger.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And the chance of
birth defects goes up.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And it goes up with the
mother and the father.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:84%
My father was 11 years
older than my mother.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
My mother thinks
actually my birth defect

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:84%
may have been caused by
the medicine they gave her

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
because she had terrible
nausea all the way through.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And she's afraid that there
was something in there

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't
know about then.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: You know, we
keep finding out things.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm, absolutely.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But you're such a
great example, though.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.221 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I think
it was meant to be.

00:21:11.221 --> 00:21:14.406 align:middle line:90%
I've had 40 blood transfusions.

00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're such
a great example

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of how nothing can
get in your way.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, you know, when
you have something like that,

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.930 align:middle line:84%
you say to yourself
it's me or the leg.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to win?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes the leg does win.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.685 align:middle line:84%
I've broken my thigh
bone four times.

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And they would put
me in the hospital for eight

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:84%
months because they
couldn't go in.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And on the third break,
I had broken it just

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:90%
by stubbing my toe.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I said to them--
and Doctor Frankel

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:90%
was back in that hospital.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:84%
He had gone away to
Seattle and Cincinnati.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said you're
here, and I'm here.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.602 align:middle line:84%
And I'm young enough, I
want the steel in the leg.

00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said you'll
bleed to death, Susan.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said I don't
want to live like this.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I can't go anywhere.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.282 align:middle line:84%
I could break my leg
in Bloomingdale's.

00:21:59.282 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:90%
I can't live like this.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:90%
I had children.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:90%
And I had risked my life.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I had just signed my will.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And he did put the steel in.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I had 17 transfusions
that night.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I did die on the table.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.540 align:middle line:90%
He brought me back.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
of those mystical--

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No-- no light?

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
You didn't--

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I had
post-operative stress

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.490 align:middle line:84%
where I kept seeing meteorites
coming through my window.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed it was only-- like
if you and I were having lunch,

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
if there was a
window behind you--

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.801 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I would see it only
if it was back lit behind you.

00:22:28.801 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And you don't think--

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.453 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: This big
black thing coming.

00:22:31.453 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
I was seeing was

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the doctors with
the light over me

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
because you'd be in shadow
if there was a bright light,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.289 align:middle line:90%
you know, sun streaming in.

00:22:40.289 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.019 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And every once in a
while when I was in a situation

00:22:44.019 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:90%
like that, it would come.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And I would burst into tears.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And the last one was when
I was being interviewed

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:90%
by a journalist from India.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want
to burst into tears

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:90%
when there's a reporter there.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.205 align:middle line:90%
And he was so sweet and so kind.

00:22:57.205 --> 00:22:58.717 align:middle line:90%
And I said you know what?

00:22:58.717 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'll ever
have another episode again

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
because the meteorites were
getting bigger, whatever

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:90%
these black things coming at me.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And they would come
out of nowhere.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.981 align:middle line:84%
And I never had another
one after that one.

00:23:07.981 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:90%
It was so gigantic.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I knew that that was it.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.056 align:middle line:84%
But I began noticing
it had to be

00:23:13.056 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
a back lit situation
for that to happen.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.764 align:middle line:84%
So I was remembering
something when I was asleep.

>>LISA: Well, you don't
think that has anything

Thank you for sharing it.

00:23:45.052 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well,
all the things that

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
happen to you make
you different.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.101 align:middle line:84%
And I honestly think that
it's good to have something

00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:90%
different from everybody else.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.082 align:middle line:90%
We all want to be the same.

00:23:55.082 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
part of me that I

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.225 align:middle line:84%
wish I had legs that
matched without all

00:23:59.225 --> 00:24:00.520 align:middle line:90%
the scars and everything.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.166 align:middle line:90%
But it's OK.

00:24:02.166 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Things that make you
different give you

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
a new view of life,
a new perspective,

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
that maybe your
friend doesn't have,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%
but she'll have something else.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So we all have to
put it together.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you're an
inspiration to millions.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: I love--

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: No, I can feel pain.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I can go in a room, and I talk
to someone just for a while,

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.119 align:middle line:84%
I can tell if they're
feeling something.

00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.035 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Oh, by the way, your
question about what people

00:24:29.035 --> 00:24:30.675 align:middle line:90%
ask for besides having children.

00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: I would like a job.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.065 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to change my job.

00:24:35.065 --> 00:24:36.660 align:middle line:90%
I'd like a new job.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
The fact that people are
asking about romance now--

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.105 align:middle line:84%
for like four years,
nobody asked about it.

00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: People just
wanted to pay the rent.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I'm really--
and I do a lot of appearances.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.502 align:middle line:84%
And Bendal sent me around
the United States--

00:24:50.502 --> 00:24:51.335 align:middle line:90%
different companies.

00:24:51.335 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Doing next week,
Lady Dior handbags--

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
different-- I come in-- you
know, and I meet people.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me things,
but now that they're

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:84%
asking for love tells me that
they've got things covered,

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:90%
and that they're feeling secure.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.177 align:middle line:84%
You cannot think about love
until the money's coming in--

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And that you
can sleep at night.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that was coming
out of the recession,

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and people were
very, very concerned.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I
think it's better.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And have
extreme hardship

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to finances.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.648 align:middle line:90%
So we need to fix that, yeah.

00:25:21.648 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, we do
have a very unstable month

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:90%
coming, April.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It is not a month
to start a new business.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a month to sit and watch.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Open the window, and
see what flies in.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:90%
I always say that.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Look, some things you
can't control in life.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.321 align:middle line:90%
There are two eclipses.

00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the month of April?

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:41.275 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:25:41.275 --> 00:25:42.680 align:middle line:90%
One is on April 15th.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
The universe doesn't
know it's our tax day.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But only Pisces and Virgo will
have meditations about money.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Actually, everyone else will
have it in a different way.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.555 align:middle line:84%
Although, I think the United
States' economy may rock

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:57.055 align:middle line:90%
a little.

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At that time?

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Yeah, so if you
have a 401(k) that you've

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:84%
been contributing
to, you just say

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.190 align:middle line:84%
to your broker what
do you suggest?

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:90%
I would like to be very stable.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be in a
stock that is volatile.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should be in mutual
funds, whatever it is.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.530 align:middle line:84%
He's going to tell
you because I can't.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:90%
But I would say go safe.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
If you're out of
work, get something.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.517 align:middle line:90%
Get to high ground.

00:26:23.517 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Get your foot in the door.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're an energetic person,
just pick an industry you love.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.962 align:middle line:84%
You're the one who's
going to be staying late.

00:26:29.962 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Your boss is going to say
I can't lose this employee.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:90%
This girl is like amazing.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And she's always
giving me suggestions.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're a little
eager beaver, you're

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.790 align:middle line:84%
going to go really far
because most people just

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:42.786 align:middle line:90%
want to go home.

00:26:42.786 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So April is a
rockier month in 2014?

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.381 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Yes, it's
the hardest month

00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:47.784 align:middle line:84%
of the year, April
15th and 29th.

00:26:47.784 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you able
to predict anything

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:90%
like a natural disaster?

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I don't like
to put it out there.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:90%
One is in Libra.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And so Aries is going
to have meditations

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.189 align:middle line:90%
about relationships.

00:27:02.189 --> 00:27:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Meditations, when
you say it, what do you mean?

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, you
know, questions come up.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.935 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:07.935 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: If you
have an eclipse,

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have a
bad relationship-- see,

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
eclipses, or even
full moons are just

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.001 align:middle line:84%
little heat-seeking missiles
to see if there's a weak link.

00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: If it
doesn't find anything,

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.580 align:middle line:90%
you're going to say it was fine.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.785 align:middle line:84%
It really will show you,
like a little barking dog,

00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and pull you along, you
know, like Lassie used to do.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Like it's there to help you.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and sometimes
eclipses draw health down

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:90%
because it's exhausting.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't have too much
on your calendar in April

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.300 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to be
needed maybe to help someone.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.707 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your best
friend needs you.

00:27:47.707 --> 00:27:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it's good to know.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you say you don't
like to put it out there

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.710 align:middle line:84%
about natural disasters,
is it because you

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.404 align:middle line:84%
don't want to weaken the
idea around it so that people

00:27:56.404 --> 00:27:57.070 align:middle line:90%
are susceptible?

00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I don't want to
talk about terrorism or-- one

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:05.880 align:middle line:84%
astrologer, I went
to a seminar, there

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.667 align:middle line:84%
was a big convention
in Philadelphia--

00:28:08.667 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:84%
said we're going to have
a worse situation than we

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.270 align:middle line:90%
did in September 2008.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was the worst any
of us had ever experienced.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.150 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go to
an ATM, and there's not

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.484 align:middle line:90%
going to be any money there.

00:28:18.484 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:90%
I think he's overstating it.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Now he is a broker.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:90%
He's highly respected.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.605 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves him.

00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I thought well,
I see it as a tough time.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it's
going to be to that extreme

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
because hopefully we've
learned a few things from 2008.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Remember September 15th
when everything collapsed?

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.020 align:middle line:90%
I doubt very much.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.940 align:middle line:84%
But if I were talking to Janet
Yellen, I'd say-- you know,

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:84%
who's taking over
for Bernanke-- I

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.900 align:middle line:84%
know you're trying to
move the needle slightly,

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:84%
but maybe we should let it
go the first 1/2 of the year

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:84%
because you can feel an eclipse
one month to the day later.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.069 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you consult with
a major political figure?

00:29:04.069 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: No.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.818 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Not that you're
going to mention their names.

00:29:06.818 --> 00:29:09.174 align:middle line:84%
Or people in the
financial industry?

00:29:09.174 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: See,
living in New York,

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:90%
you have mostly business people.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.355 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: You don't have
so many movie stars.

00:29:14.355 --> 00:29:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Although, I know some of them.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But I don't do that much
one to one consulting

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
anymore because I'm writing
for "ELLE" America, "Vogue

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Japan," "W Korea,"
"Tempo" in Turkey,

I write.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.534 align:middle line:90%
No, I saw that you had a great--

00:29:34.534 --> 00:29:36.116 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I don't
write about fashion.

00:29:36.116 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:90%
I write about your life.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I loved what
I saw was in "ELLE."

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was how you related the
My Horoscope to My Handbag,

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:90%
and it was--

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Really?

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it was in
the article about you.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.826 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: What is
my editor doing?

00:29:47.826 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.470 align:middle line:84%
No, there was a
special cover story

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:84%
where I did do something
about fashion, but not

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:90%
in my regular column.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:56.473 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:29:56.473 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I just-- you know
because I take this seriously.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want them to
dilute it, but they wouldn't.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.087 align:middle line:90%
They're so nice up at "ELLE."

00:30:04.087 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So now every year,
you do a Year Ahead calendar.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: It's my fun.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough to just work.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:90%
I have to do things.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And I have this
beautiful calendar.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want it to hang on
the wall and make you happy.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: So I look
for rich color,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and this was all done
by Gloria Vanderbilt.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.570 align:middle line:84%
She's 90 and did such a romantic
picture of a man and a woman.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Aww.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.389 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And we
license the material.

00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And then I write
in the little squares

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:90%
what the aspect is.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And this is for everyone.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.956 align:middle line:90%
I don't have 12 calendars.

00:30:38.956 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:90%
That would be crazy.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, right.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.774 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But what to
think about on that day

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:84%
so that if someone says
do you want to come in

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
on Tuesday or Friday,
you take a look.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.035 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to know which day.

00:30:50.035 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So, for example, what
does a warning day look like?

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.600 align:middle line:90%
What does it say?

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, on
April 15th, I said

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.335 align:middle line:90%
it was a truly monster moon.

00:30:59.335 --> 00:30:59.946 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:30:59.946 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Monster moon?

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, my readers know
that my monsters are the 15th.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I have an awful lot there.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.780 align:middle line:84%
But I can't-- see, it's so funny
how I take these things out

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.180 align:middle line:84%
of my mind, but let's
look at July, July 24th--

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Which is the
luckiest day of the year,

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and I want people
to know about that.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:18.582 align:middle line:84%
So do people call
you, and ask you

00:31:18.582 --> 00:31:19.645 align:middle line:90%
what day should I get married?

00:31:19.645 --> 00:31:20.978 align:middle line:90%
What day should I set contracts?

00:31:20.978 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: All my friends.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And somebody will say
to me, like oh, I'm

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.400 align:middle line:90%
getting married on this day?

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Is this OK?

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm like did you make
out the invitations yet,

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.490 align:middle line:90%
and you bought the dress?

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm like it's fine.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a good day.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:84%
How can I tell her she
picked the worse day of all?

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And one bride said to me-- I
said you haven't, thank god,

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:84%
haven't done the
invitations yet?

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.010 align:middle line:90%
But Mercury's retrograde.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And that rules contracts.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't
want that date.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.190 align:middle line:90%
She said-- and things go wrong.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said oh,
I don't care if I

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:84%
get blue napkins
instead of pink.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I said oh, you think
it's just for the day?

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:84%
The day you get married is
the day you give birth--

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: To your relationship.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a serious thing.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's for the
rest of your life.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:84%
These aspects are going
to be with you forever.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.559 align:middle line:84%
Does the same go for
contracts and day

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:90%
you start your first job?

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:15.766 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:32:15.766 --> 00:32:16.807 align:middle line:90%
The birth of the venture.

00:32:16.807 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.580 align:middle line:84%
My best friend came
to me so worried.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:84%
She said Craig will not
change the wedding date.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's Tuscany in October.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:29.220 align:middle line:90%
I said OK.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:84%
We have a little bit
of a problem here.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:84%
How about-- you have
to pick up the license?

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I will pick a good
day in September,

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:90%
and you go down to City Hall.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And you bring your sister,
or a couple of friends

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.160 align:middle line:84%
to be witnesses, or
pick up somebody there.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.505 align:middle line:90%
And they'll sign the paper.

00:32:46.505 --> 00:32:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You never tell
your mom or father.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.800 align:middle line:90%
You never tell your family.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.570 align:middle line:90%
You never celebrate that day.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.767 align:middle line:84%
But astrologically,
that's your wedding day.

00:32:55.767 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.809 align:middle line:90%
Well, why wouldn't you tell--

00:32:57.809 --> 00:32:59.683 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, he
wouldn't move the wedding.

00:32:59.683 --> 00:33:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, I see.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And because he
loved her enough, he said OK.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.504 align:middle line:90%
I could do that.

00:33:05.504 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's a
good negotiation.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.919 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: It's a legal
beginning to the wedding.

00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And that, to us, is
the important day.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's like a--

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.024 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And she had a
regular wedding in Tuscany.

00:33:14.024 --> 00:33:15.926 align:middle line:90%
And it turned out great.

00:33:15.926 --> 00:33:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And her marriage is wonderful.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything is good.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.263 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
I was waiting for.

00:33:20.263 --> 00:33:21.840 align:middle line:90%
I was waiting to hear that part.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing would go for
if you were planning a-- what

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.270 align:middle line:84%
about C-sections when
people schedule those?

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I had that
with my second child,

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:84%
but a baby comes when
it wants to be born.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.235 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Does it?

00:33:34.235 --> 00:33:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: And--

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even when
you schedule them?

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, I was
scheduled for April 19th, which

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I did give birth
to Diana that day.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted
me in the morning.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And they say come
to the hospital.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.860 align:middle line:90%
You haven't had any water.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.600 align:middle line:90%
You haven't had any food.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.500 align:middle line:90%
So I get there at 6 AM.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are no
operating rooms.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.781 align:middle line:84%
The whole day I'm like
please give me a drip.

00:33:56.781 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Give me something.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm so dry.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Finally at 8:01, she
was born at night.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I was worried
because she wasn't quite going

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.300 align:middle line:90%
to fit in with the family.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.585 align:middle line:84%
She was a surprise, but
I wanted her so badly.

00:34:10.585 --> 00:34:11.215 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:34:11.215 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I was
willing to make out

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:90%
my will and everything.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But she had the perfect rising
sign to fit into the family.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, I'm Catholic.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
Catechism, they

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.107 align:middle line:90%
teach you about your religion.

00:34:26.107 --> 00:34:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I remember once we were
sitting in a little circle

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:90%
with the nun.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And the nuns said
God omnipotent.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And he knows what you're
going to do before you do it.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:34.938 align:middle line:90%
I'm go oh.

00:34:34.938 --> 00:34:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm like does it mean it
doesn't matter when-- oh, no.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.600 align:middle line:90%
It matters.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:90%
It matters.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to try to
do the right thing.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.509 align:middle line:90%
So I'm listening so intently.

00:34:42.509 --> 00:34:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Now the bell rings.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.245 align:middle line:84%
The kids are allowed
to go out and play.

00:34:45.245 --> 00:34:46.685 align:middle line:90%
And I'm tugging at her.

00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:48.900 align:middle line:84%
She said don't you want
to go out and play?

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.025 align:middle line:90%
No!

00:34:50.025 --> 00:34:53.264 align:middle line:90%
Can we go over that again?

00:34:53.264 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And I never really
understood the concept

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
until I had Diana
because God knew

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd be a great mother
to both my children

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.790 align:middle line:90%
and gave me the right children.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.235 align:middle line:90%
We're so close.

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:04.735 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:05.776 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:35:05.776 --> 00:35:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: So pregnant
women shouldn't

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:84%
be worried that they're
having the wrong baby.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And also, don't worry if you're
marrying the wrong person.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:84%
There's something
drew you together.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.380 align:middle line:90%
And the rising sun is important.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.040 align:middle line:84%
You have eight planets
plus the sun and moon.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
your chart will never

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:84%
be replicated ever
in time and space?

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.907 align:middle line:84%
Not in history,
not in the future.

00:35:26.907 --> 00:35:27.739 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No one ever?

00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: You have a
completely unique chart

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.810 align:middle line:84%
because the planets move
at such different speeds.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.036 align:middle line:84%
Even twins have
different charts.

00:35:35.036 --> 00:35:35.660 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes--

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: The cusps move because
they're a minute or two apart.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And it matters.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Astrology is so
excruciatingly detailed.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I read that
we're made of stardust.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.930 align:middle line:90%
This is just wonderful.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.810 align:middle line:90%
So people should be happy.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.547 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a baby
with Mercury retrograde,

00:35:54.547 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:90%
those babies--

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was going
to ask you about that.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about that.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, I'm born with
Mercury retrograde, but--

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:90%
And you're a communicator.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.224 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:36:00.224 --> 00:36:01.842 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't hurt me at all.

00:36:01.842 --> 00:36:03.800 align:middle line:84%
It makes you more
philosophical because Mercury

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.550 align:middle line:90%
makes you think back.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.411 align:middle line:84%
And no, it's always
good to be born.

00:36:09.411 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what is
Mercury retrograde?

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.585 align:middle line:90%
Can you dispel that myth at all?

00:36:12.585 --> 00:36:13.376 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Well, no.

00:36:13.376 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:90%
No, well it's not a myth.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is a very
articulate planet.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Think of him as
little Hermes, OK?

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.460 align:middle line:90%
He sits up in the cave.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And he tells his
mother I'm not going

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.110 align:middle line:90%
to live in this horrible cave.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.651 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be on Mount Olympus
with my brothers and sisters

00:36:29.651 --> 00:36:31.530 align:middle line:84%
because Mercury does
rule siblings, too.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like how come
they're on Mount Olympus,

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.925 align:middle line:84%
and we're in this
dingy, horrible cave?

00:36:35.925 --> 00:36:36.995 align:middle line:90%
And it's cold.

00:36:36.995 --> 00:36:38.710 align:middle line:84%
She said I had an
affair with Zeus.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.410 align:middle line:90%
You must be quiet.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.710 align:middle line:90%
You cannot tell anybody.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.995 align:middle line:90%
And this is our lot in life.

00:36:43.995 --> 00:36:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:84%
This baby talks
the day he's born.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, Gemini and
Virgo is very articulate.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And this planet rules
these two signs.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:84%
He goes and steals
Apollo's cattle.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And he makes them walk
backwards-- Mercury

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:84%
retrograde-- makes them work
backwards so that Apollo can't

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.170 align:middle line:90%
figure out where the cattle is.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And he sees a farmer there.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And he says oh,
you saw this, huh?

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Here's some money, and you're
not going to say a word.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.354 align:middle line:90%
So he said OK, I'm good.

00:37:13.354 --> 00:37:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Communication.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: The next day,
Mercury comes back,

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:84%
sees the farmer walking
around, but he changes his--

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.760 align:middle line:84%
because Mercury is mercurial--
the temperature, you know?

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:90%
And he looks different.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.950 align:middle line:84%
He said did you see a
child take some cattle?

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.570 align:middle line:90%
They went that way.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:29.930 align:middle line:90%
I can't trust this guy.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.050 align:middle line:90%
So he turns him to stone.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So now Apollo is
missing his cattle

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and starting to put two and two
together, goes into the cave,

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and brings his beautiful
light, the sun,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.750 align:middle line:84%
the light of
illumination, of truth.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.220 align:middle line:90%
His mother's there.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And the baby sees him coming,
goes back in the bassinet.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And Apollo says I
know you're awake.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.985 align:middle line:90%
I know you took my cattle.

00:37:55.985 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So the baby comes up and
starts arguing with him.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, what did you
expect me to do?

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.092 align:middle line:84%
And Apollo can't
believe this child.

00:38:02.092 --> 00:38:03.800 align:middle line:84%
He said I don't know
what to do with you.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pick you up
and bring you to Zeus.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.770 align:middle line:90%
He'll know what to do.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:09.730 align:middle line:90%
Here, come with me.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.220 align:middle line:90%
We're going to Mount Olympus.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:13.102 align:middle line:90%
So Hermes is happy.

00:38:13.102 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:90%
We're going to Mount Olympus.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're such
a great story-teller.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.135 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well,
he goes up there.

00:38:17.135 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And he's on the lap of Zeus.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:23.865 align:middle line:84%
And Zeus says gosh, this
child even looks like me.

00:38:23.865 --> 00:38:25.820 align:middle line:90%
And he's so smart.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.490 align:middle line:84%
See, Mercury is the
brain function, thinking,

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:84%
communication,
articulation, negotiation.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So all the planets have
different territory.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Pluto could only go underground.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had a place where
they're allowed to travel,

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.355 align:middle line:90%
except Mercury.

00:38:45.355 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:84%
He said I'm going to let you
travel wherever you want,

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Heaven, Earth, and Hades.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.556 align:middle line:90%
You can go anywhere you want.

00:38:52.556 --> 00:38:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only
planet that has that.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.971 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's considered
the travel sign.

00:38:55.971 --> 00:38:57.845 align:middle line:84%
He said you're going
to be my agent.

00:38:57.845 --> 00:38:58.970 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be near me.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to speak for me.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And every time Mercury
goes more than 27

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:07.781 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 degrees away from
the sun, he yanks him back.

00:39:07.781 --> 00:39:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, so
that's what it means.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: 27 and 1/2 degrees.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:90%
He said where are you going?

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:84%
The deal is you have
to stay with me.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And he got to live
on Mount Olympus.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.086 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's the story
of Mercury and retrograde.

00:39:18.086 --> 00:39:19.510 align:middle line:90%
I have never heard that before.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.093 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: So they're
also very clever.

00:39:21.093 --> 00:39:23.489 align:middle line:84%
So Mercury Retrograde, you
don't want to sign a contract.

00:39:23.489 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because of
the communication?

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.757 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Because
you'll have to redo it.

00:39:26.757 --> 00:39:27.590 align:middle line:90%
You're not thinking.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.180 align:middle line:84%
See, also, I have found that
when Mercury is retrograde,

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.370 align:middle line:84%
the wind is changing direction,
but you can't see it yet.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
landscape of your life.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're like everything's
the same, it's fine.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But you're not
taking into account things that

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:90%

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.450 align:middle line:90%

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And you make
bad judgment calls.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.050 align:middle line:84%
My own daughter, little
Diana bought a computer

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:90%
with Mercury Retrograde.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:90%
You're never to buy electronics.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said Mommy, the
computer you bought me

00:39:54.730 --> 00:40:00.040 align:middle line:84%
for Christmas, the Apple, I have
to sell it on eBay because it's

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.710 align:middle line:90%
not suitable for my needs.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.640 align:middle line:84%
It won't hold my music
files big enough.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And she is in the
music business.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.744 align:middle line:84%
I said when did you
buy the computer?

00:40:08.744 --> 00:40:09.910 align:middle line:90%
When Mercury was retrograde.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.667 align:middle line:90%
I'm like Diana!

00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Your own daughter.

>>MILLER: Yeah, 48,000.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:27.634 align:middle line:84%
Some months only 36,000

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.055 align:middle line:84%
The last 10 days of

00:40:34.055 --> 00:40:34.930 align:middle line:90%
know they can't call.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't see them.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.341 align:middle line:84%
I don't have dental
appointments.

00:40:37.341 --> 00:40:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have such an
amazing passion for it.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:90%
And you just--

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Love it.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I also
understand that you were just

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:46.509 align:middle line:84%
voted as one of the
members of the Academy.

00:40:46.509 --> 00:40:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:47.510 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As a voting
member of the Academy.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Well, it's
because I said in Hollywood

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:90%
that I love television.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:54.900 align:middle line:90%
It's the Emmy's.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.825 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Emmy judge.

00:40:56.825 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that's
supposed to get out there,

00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:59.707 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, it's still--

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: But it's a
very serious thing.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said I love television.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I was invited
to have an application.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very serious about it.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.680 align:middle line:90%
They send you discs, CDs.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to watch
every-- you pick a category.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I like drama, which of
course is the most work.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I watch everything twice,
which you don't really have to.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And you fill it
out like the SAT.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It's so funny.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I like this one show called
"So You Think You Can Dance."

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And then you vote on the phone.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I watched that show twice.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to be sure that i
picked the right person.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But remember, I'm
writing at the same time,

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and I'm keeping an eye on it.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.236 align:middle line:84%
So if I watch it twice then
I've seen the whole thing.

00:41:40.236 --> 00:41:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm like that particular
routine was special.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:43.964 align:middle line:84%
I want to actually
look at it now.

00:41:43.964 --> 00:41:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Let me just ask you.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Has technology changed the
way that you do astrology?

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Everything,
everything.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I could've
written this much

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:55.396 align:middle line:84%
if there were no
computers, for example,

00:41:55.396 --> 00:41:57.060 align:middle line:90%
or if there were no laptops.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But social media changed a lot
because I can get feedback.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Somebody once said to me you
first had the "Gutenberg Bible"

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.920 align:middle line:90%
so you could read.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Then you had radio.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:09.890 align:middle line:90%
You could hear.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Then you had television.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:90%
You could read, see, and hear.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.550 align:middle line:90%
But then you had the Internet.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.070 align:middle line:90%
And you could respond.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.540 align:middle line:90%
And it closed the box.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And that response
area is so important.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.865 align:middle line:84%
I may not imagine all
the ways an aspect could

00:42:30.865 --> 00:42:33.140 align:middle line:84%
assert itself and manifest
in people's lives.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But if I get enough
feedback, I can.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was really funny.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Some media expert
said you're answering

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:90%
so many people on Twitter.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.282 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:42:44.282 --> 00:42:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: And I love Twitter.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:46.449 align:middle line:90%
Twitter is my favorite.

00:42:46.449 --> 00:42:47.865 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
it's fast or what?

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:48.806 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: It's fast.

00:42:48.806 --> 00:42:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And you don't get
long questions.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I'm on
Facebook as Susan Miller.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.720 align:middle line:84%
But on Twitter,
I'm astrologyzone.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say please tell me
how this eclipse affected you.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And tell me your birthday.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Not your year, but
tell me I'm April 15th,

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.090 align:middle line:90%
and this is what happened.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And they'll ask me questions.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And that really
changed everything.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.580 align:middle line:84%
All that feedback,
I feel they're

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.660 align:middle line:90%
making me better, the readers.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely because you
get the response to understand

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.037 align:middle line:90%
if you're accurate, or where--

00:43:19.037 --> 00:43:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Yeah, well,
it was so funny.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.110 align:middle line:84%
The expert told me don't
answer all these questions.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.229 align:middle line:90%
Just do broadcasts.

00:43:24.229 --> 00:43:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And say I'm going to be here
for an hour and broadcast.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I said that's-- I don't
like to do anything--

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you said a part--
that what you'd been taught

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.088 align:middle line:84%
by your mother was
the philosophy--

00:43:32.088 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Yeah.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And I like to have an exchange.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like to
just broadcast out.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And someone said
to me wow, you'll

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.180 align:middle line:84%
answer a question with
somebody with no followers?

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I said sure, I don't
check how many followers.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.090 align:middle line:84%
That person may have gone on
Twitter just to ask me that.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.790 align:middle line:90%
So it has to be genuine.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:50.835 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be me.

00:43:50.835 --> 00:43:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I will not let
anybody tweet for me.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.006 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you
have any challenges

00:43:54.006 --> 00:43:56.329 align:middle line:90%
in what you do as an astrologer?

00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.578 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:43:57.578 --> 00:43:59.710 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting question.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, writing all that down.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And some months,
you have a fever.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And some months--
you know, you have

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.860 align:middle line:90%
things happen in your life.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
this at lunch today.

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:15.544 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, when your
body is crying for sleep--

00:44:15.544 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:84%
it's now 3 o'clock
in the morning.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm lucky in that I only
sleep five hours a night.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.610 align:middle line:90%
And I wake up without an alarm.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up like
right out of a toaster.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.660 align:middle line:90%
And I never need coffee.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: It's like incredible.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.883 align:middle line:84%
I like the taste
of coffee, so I'll

00:44:26.883 --> 00:44:28.220 align:middle line:90%
have a mild cup once in a while.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.510 align:middle line:90%
But I don't need it.

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:33.640 align:middle line:84%
It's those times when you are so
tired that you write the best.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And you're like oh gosh,
I can't go to sleep.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.140 align:middle line:90%
It's all coming.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.550 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
times when you're

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.916 align:middle line:84%
writing that it's coming
out of your fingers.

00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're reading
it, and you're

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:84%
like what else is
it going to say?

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I
was writing my book,

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:48.750 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting in a cafe.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And this woman was
sitting next to me.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:50.730 align:middle line:90%
She had her glasses on.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.670 align:middle line:90%
She had her book.

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.140 align:middle line:90%
She had her coffee.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:90%
She's working away.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.760 align:middle line:84%
She probably was a graduate
student or something.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm re-reading Taurus a
hundred times from my book.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, before you
send it to your editor.

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.220 align:middle line:90%
And finally, I went send.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Right before I did that,
I said who wrote this?

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.230 align:middle line:90%
God wrote this.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:12.175 align:middle line:90%
I can't take credit for this.

00:45:12.175 --> 00:45:16.770 align:middle line:84%
This is good, and I have no
idea how this turned out.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:17.640 align:middle line:90%
She turned to me.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.880 align:middle line:84%
She said whoa, what
are you writing?

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm like oh, you heard that?

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.116 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:45:22.116 --> 00:45:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's funny.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:24.508 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I said
I'm an astrologer,

00:45:24.508 --> 00:45:25.500 align:middle line:90%
and I'm writing a book.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.333 align:middle line:90%
I have this website.

00:45:26.333 --> 00:45:27.944 align:middle line:84%
And she goes-- takes
her glasses off--

00:45:27.944 --> 00:45:30.235 align:middle line:84%
she says you're Susan Miller,
and she starts screaming.

00:45:30.235 --> 00:45:31.364 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like--

00:45:31.364 --> 00:45:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, how funny.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And I said well,
you're giving me courage.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.650 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, writing a
book, it's out there so long,

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.090 align:middle line:90%
you're more tense about it.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:39.760 align:middle line:90%
And you want it thorough.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.960 align:middle line:84%
When I get tense, a
little secret about me

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.194 align:middle line:90%
is I write extra long.

00:45:43.194 --> 00:45:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, no wonder.

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: Because I'm afraid
I'll overlook something.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.200 align:middle line:84%
The more pressured I
am, the longer it goes,

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.260 align:middle line:84%
but yet it holds
together very nicely.

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And I do have an
editor to make sure.

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:55.760 align:middle line:84%
When Sherry writes
to me and says

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.079 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
this-- you know,

00:45:58.079 --> 00:45:59.370 align:middle line:90%
you didn't flush it out enough.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:00.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't argue with her.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.170 align:middle line:90%
She is the voice of the reader.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm like oh, I thought
that was clear.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.568 align:middle line:90%
Let me have another go at it.

00:46:05.568 --> 00:46:06.394 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:46:06.394 --> 00:46:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you get it--
you are magnificent.

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful to have
the opportunity to sit with you

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and hear your story.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.352 align:middle line:84%
And it's so clear why
you are successful.

00:46:16.352 --> 00:46:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: Oh, I just love it.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I am the
servant to my readers.

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.455 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrillingly and happily--

00:46:21.455 --> 00:46:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you do it from
a place of passion, and purpose,

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and beyond against all
odds, and you're incredible.

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:27.776 align:middle line:90%
>>MILLER: And it came to me.

00:46:27.776 --> 00:46:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Time Warner said write
down what you tell us

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:33.180 align:middle line:84%
because, at some point, I
was done with my studies

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:33.775 align:middle line:90%
with my mom.

00:46:33.775 --> 00:46:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And my mother said you can.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And I would read for friends.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But I was an agent for
commercial photographers.

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:40.890 align:middle line:84%
I was dealing with
creative people.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Creative people, even if they're
accountants, they're creative.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:47.310 align:middle line:84%
They want to know what
else can I do for my life?

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.765 align:middle line:90%
How can I push the boundaries?

00:46:48.765 --> 00:46:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Moving forward.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
got into the public?

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And that's
where Time Warner said

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.260 align:middle line:84%
we will put you on
our website if you--

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and when they said
website, I knew

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.371 align:middle line:84%
it was what my
mother had predicted.

00:47:02.371 --> 00:47:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: The Internet
was that mysterious thing

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.100 align:middle line:90%
that was coming.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: M-hm.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: And they
wanted something short

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.290 align:middle line:90%
for women every day.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted something
very long and comprehensive

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.310 align:middle line:90%
for men and women once a month.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And they said that flies
in the face of web wisdom.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.740 align:middle line:90%
It should be short and daily.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm like no, no, no.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:90%
You must trust me on this.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.460 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They did.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.808 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:47:28.808 --> 00:47:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful to sit down
with you for this time.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.888 align:middle line:84%
>>MILLER: I'm so
grateful to be with you.

00:47:32.888 --> 00:47:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Lisa.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.319 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Susan Miller, amazing.

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:37.360 align:middle line:84%
