>>LISA GARR: Have you ever felt
disconnected or disassociated

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:90%
from your body?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
You know that stagnant energy
that is trapped in your body

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:90%
could actually be the reason.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's affecting
all of the systems

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
in your body required for
health and for wholeness.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to learn
how to connect your body's

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:90%
innate circuits again?

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr and
joining me is the master

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:10%
of bioenergetic medicine--

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Sue Morter she is known
for bringing science, spirit,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.132 align:middle line:10%
and human possibility
together-- welcome.

00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE MORTER: It is such a
joy to be with you always,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.862 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, and a great
joy to be here.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I'm really
looking forward to this

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:84%
because you are not
only the embodiment

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:90%
of bioenergetic medicine.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But I would love to hear
you explain what is it.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MORTER: Bioenergetic
medicine is something

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:10%
a little more close to home
than people probably think.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:10%
It is an energy that
flows through our body.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
"Bio" means body and
"energetic" means energy--

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and there is an
energy that is flowing

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:84%
through the physical
body constantly.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And if that energy
is flowing freely,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:84%
then we are healthy
and vital and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:90%
clear and strong and robust.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And we can manifest and achieve
the things that we want.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not, it's
kind of like we can't.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
is learning how

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
to move that energy consciously
and intentionally so

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:90%
that it doesn't stagnate.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So that it doesn't
cause our lives

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
to become less abundant and
flourishing than it could be.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is the source
of all disease is basically

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:90%
stress and stuck energy.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Absolutely,
when energy is not moving,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:90%
vital force isn't moving.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:10%
So a communication that's
designed to be happening

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:10%
in the body is not available.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:10%
It's not available to tell
the electromagnetic system,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:10%
the respiratory system,
the hormonal system,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:10%
the endocrine system, the
immune systems what's going on.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.692 align:middle line:84%
So if the energy isn't
moving and the communication

00:02:18.692 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
it isn't happening, pretty
soon our bodies just

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:84%
become segmented and
breakdown starts to happen.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Cells start to implode.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.802 align:middle line:90%
And disease gets started.

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But Western
medicine segments it.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It's here's the endocrinologist
and here's the heart specialist

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:90%
and there's various--

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.983 align:middle line:84%
it's like they take different
departments for an organ.

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look
at the whole body.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, and this
is part of the problem.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
This is why our
country is in the shape

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:84%
that it's in regarding so many
disease conditions just taking

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
over and so many
medications that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.900 align:middle line:84%
are being prescribed for all
kinds of separate conditions.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we're no longer
looking at the whole being

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:90%
in our medical culture.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is time that we start
bridging these worlds back

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.747 align:middle line:84%
together again and allowing the
whole being to have a chance.

00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The great news is
that we can do this ourselves.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.585 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually only ourselves
that can do this, right?

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:09.752 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, we're the
only ones that can actually

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:90%
allow healing to happen.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
The beauty is it's
by design supposed

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:90%
to be happening automatically.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
not been taught is

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
how to allow that to happen
without getting in the way.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Many of our habitual ways of
thinking and being and doing

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
an actioning in
the world are what

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
gets in the way of that
natural energy flow

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.137 align:middle line:90%
to allow us to self heal.

00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Even if you do
so many things right,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
you've got environmental toxins
and environmental stressors

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and things that we never could
have predicted in our world.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you pull this
energy together from--

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:90%
is it multiple layers?

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it from the ground?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
How do you do this?

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, we're using
the energies of the Earth

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
to help us feel
grounded and nurtured.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're also
using the energies

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
of inspiration and possibility
to allow us to be uplifted

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and to engage in a bigger,
better life for ourselves

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
than, perhaps, we've been
experiencing trapped inside

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:90%
of our old beliefs.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And, most importantly,
we're learning

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
how to take all those
energies from outside of us

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and move them through
the inside of us

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
to allow an
integration to occur.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:84%
So that we're tapping all of
the aspects of our wholeness

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:84%
again and allowing ourselves
to live as magnificent creators

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
striving survivors.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From the neck up.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have come from a
long line of doctors, yes?

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Your father--

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: I am
number 9 in a family

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:90%
of 13 doctors in my family.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, you're committed.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.045 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, it's
we're either very devoted

00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
or we're just not very creative
to think of other things to do.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you're carrying
out a massive body of work

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: We're completely
devoted to this.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And it has been my
whole life purpose.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's why I'm on
the planet to share the work

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:90%
that I'm sharing.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Nice, tell me about your
father and the Morter Clinic

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and the Morter Institute.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: So the
Morter Institute

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
is something that I have
founded in the last 20 years.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been working with the
work that my father developed

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and taking it further into the
realms of meditation and kind

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:84%
of a spiritual application
of this grounded body of work

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that was originally designed,
called bioenergetics,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.360 align:middle line:90%
to help people heal naturally.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So my father was a pioneer in
energy medicine, a term that

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:90%
is now becoming very popular.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And people are very interested
because it depicts our ability

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:84%
to use energy to heal
ourselves and utilizing energy

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:84%
to heal ourselves is what
natural self-healing is all

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So my father started
developing these techniques

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.733 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s when it wasn't
even a popular conversation.

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it kind
of got ridiculed.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But he stayed the course
and developed techniques

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that doctors, at the time, were
the only ones able to learn

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
the techniques were
utilizing the world just

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in a hands on kind of way
applying different energy

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
modalities to different
parts of the body

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to create circuitry for
healing in the system again.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is this also known
as applied kinesiology?

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Applied
kinesiology is similar.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the work of
bioenergetic synchronization.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
utilizes applied kinesiology

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:84%
but also brings into the mix
how our mind and emotions

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:84%
contribute to the flow of energy
in our bodies and in our lives.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.412 align:middle line:84%
So we have the capacity to
interrupt the natural flow

00:06:36.412 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:84%
of energy that's supposed to
be traversing through the body

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.198 align:middle line:84%
by our limiting beliefs,
our convinced disposition

00:06:42.198 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're not enough or
that's something's wrong

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.340 align:middle line:84%
or that someone else should
be behaving differently for us

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.380 align:middle line:90%
to be--

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what my
father started doing

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
was recognizing that
certain beliefs are hidden

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:90%
at the subconscious level.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:10%
And we could use the body
and the patterns of energy

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:10%
that the body is
demonstrating to reveal

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:10%
to us what is stuck in this
individual's world that isn't

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:10%
allowing them to proceed
with self-healing

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:10%
or manifesting or
progressing in their lives

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:10%
in some manner or another.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.437 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The mind is so powerful.

00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: It's so powerful

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It sends all
these messages and signals

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and then buries it.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, it's
trying to awaken.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But when it's being utilized
the way that we've been trained

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:90%
to utilize it, it struggles.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And it moves into a
sense of survivorship.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And it wrestles trying
to make things work,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.170 align:middle line:84%
but it alone is not operating
from a place of wholeness.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we're constantly
stuck in a reality

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
of surviving and making do and
trying to find what's wrong

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:90%
and fixing it, et cetera.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So my work is about moving to an
entirely different perspective

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.420 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So that we're no longer
looking for what's wrong,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:90%
finding it, and fixing it.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But we're using our
mind and training

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
it to become the creator that
it is truly intended to be.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be integrated
in the body with the breath

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and allowing mind, body,
spirit, if you will,

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to collectively work
in a unified fashion.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Because when we unify,
we're in an empowered state.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
When we're splattered
and dispersed, we're not.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And separated
and fragmented--

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:84%
so the mind sends these
messages to the body.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:90%
They get housed in the body.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you help decode
them and connect the mind

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and the body all together.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, because when
the mind connects with the body

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
again, it starts listening
instead of directing.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
When the mind is not
connected to the body,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:90%
it's trying to drive the show.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:90%
It's trying it's like--

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
nobody's helping me.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:90%
So I got to get this job done.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is going to show
up to make this happen.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
As it's isolating
as a separate self,

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:84%
it begins to be
really fear based.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So when we connect
it to the body,

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
it starts to feel different
vibrational frequencies.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And there is a wisdom
rising up through the body

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that when the mind
comes onto the body,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
it now can sense
and feel an entirely

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:90%
different energetic frequency.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it interprets
reality differently

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:90%
because it's more grounded.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:90%
So our body is like our Earth.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we Earth-- when
we walk in the grass,

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.870 align:middle line:90%
we feel so much better.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.000 align:middle line:84%
When we lay down
on the grass, how

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:84%
we feel just so relieved
if we feel overwhelmed.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:90%
The same kind of thing is true.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
That the high frequencies of
the mind and its story writing,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
they start to become
tethered and anchored

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to the body when we bring
the mind onto the body

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.250 align:middle line:90%
and start to breathe.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we
start to interpret what's

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.040 align:middle line:90%
going on a little differently.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And the difference is we become
more available to possibility.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
We become more available
to creativity into wisdom.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Wisdom is here.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:90%
It resides deep in our core.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not out there,
it's in here.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.692 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But when
you connect with it,

00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's injury or
there's a sense of illness

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
or there's something
that hurts--

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:90%
what does the body do then?

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It interprets it and then
it sends fear back up.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.717 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Sure, if we bring
the mind onto the body

00:10:12.717 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and there's some part of the
body that's not comfortable

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
or it's exhibiting
pain, et cetera,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.310 align:middle line:90%
there's a reason for that pain.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that
energy is blocked.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Pain is an excess of
energy in the body.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And weakness is a
deficiency of that energy.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have to do is
get the energy flowing again.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So that the areas of blockage
where the energy is building up

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:90%
get relieved.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.655 align:middle line:84%
And the areas of
deficiency where now cells

00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:84%
aren't getting the signals
they're supposed to get,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're not doing
their job because of that,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
they start to receive
some of that energy that

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:84%
was being hoarded over
here within that blockage.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So it starts to
create a harmonizing

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:90%
balance in the system.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And all those systems start
plugging in and working

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.690 align:middle line:90%
together again for wholeness.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.353 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You can do
this with your mind?

00:10:55.353 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: You can do
it with your mind--

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
not just your mind but your mind
and your body and your breath.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:90%
That's our problem.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
We try to manage it
all with our mind.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And the mind alone
can't get the job done.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:90%
That's why we keep struggling.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, which is
why we find ourselves

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
in poverty situations
where we can't manifest

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and we get stuck by the
familial patterns of the mind.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.635 align:middle line:84%
So it really starts
at a deeper level.

00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:10%
It's not just out there
trying to find a job,

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:10%
you actually have to go deep
into the cells of the body

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.220 align:middle line:10%
to find out why you cannot
manifest what it is that you

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:10%
want, right?

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: Exactly.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Our true path is
accessible, but we

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:84%
have to connect the mind
onto the core of the body

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.960 align:middle line:84%
if we're ever going
to be able to perceive

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
what our true authentic
right next step is.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Whether that next step is
a thought or the next step

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:84%
is taking an action in a certain
direction that is truly going

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:90%
to serve our life destiny.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're shooting off
in all kinds of directions--

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
trying this or trying
that and going for this

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and trying really hard
but trying really hard

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:90%
from the wrong come from.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't have
the out picturing

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking for.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, in your life
you source this energy

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth,
from spirit-- where

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.733 align:middle line:90%
do you source this energy?

00:12:15.733 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: I have
to stay connected

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth of me, which is
the body, which is automatically

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
Earth that we're all

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:90%
walking around on top of.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the midst of that, there
is a deep spiritual truth that

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:90%
rises up through the system.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Energy pours down through
the body automatically--

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.483 align:middle line:84%
a high frequency energy, which
we would call spiritual energy.

00:12:38.483 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It traverses all the way
down through the body

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:90%
and hits the Earth.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And then turns and rises back
up in a different frequency.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
The Earth steps it down for
what I call human consumption.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And as it rises up through
us, if we don't have blockages

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
in the way, it rises all the way
up to our conscious awareness.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And we are in touch with our
spiritual truth, our destiny,

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
what's meant to be, our
potentiality, et cetera.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.910 align:middle line:84%
If there are blockages along
the way, it picks up a wobble.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.440 align:middle line:90%
It becomes distorted.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a
distortion in the energy

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:90%
field around the physical body.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy comes
down through, rises back up.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It comes up at the
top of the head

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and creates this reverberation
and recycling of energy

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.430 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
We look out through
that energy field.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And if it has a wobble,
it has a distortion,

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:90%
we see a distorted reality.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:90%
And we can affirm it.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:84%
We can build a case for it,
but it still is distorted.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And in that distortion,
we make decisions

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:34.235 align:middle line:90%
that aren't so good for us.

00:13:34.235 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what about
attracting other distorted

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:90%
energies?

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.817 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: That's
the only thing we

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
can do because in that
world like attracts like.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in that world, we
attract distorted circumstances.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
We create this
entire reality based

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:84%
upon what we think we
see, but it isn't true.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be true.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%

00:14:04.522 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And so hallelujah for energy
medicine and the progression

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:90%
that humanity is making.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at
a human system,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing the energy fields.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing different
frequencies that are emitting

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:90%
from the body, et cetera.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But even if someone
couldn't see energy,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
when they become trained
in what we're speaking of,

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.260 align:middle line:84%
you can see in the out
picturing of the physiology

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:84%
of an individual
through a body language.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
How the person is
carrying themselves,

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
what's happening
there energetically--

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:84%
the vital force that's
obvious or not--

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is all a byproduct of how
this energy is flowing

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.387 align:middle line:84%
through the body or not
because of blockages, because

00:14:45.387 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:84%
of interferences, or because
of circuits that have never

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:90%
even gotten built before.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Because we've never tapped them.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't give
ourself permission

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to believe in ourselves
to come forward

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
with what we've known in our
deep hearts, in our core,

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:90%
in our deep wisdom selves.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:90%
We've never been able to trust.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a trusted
relationship with the universe.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And so until that happens,
we have a tendency

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to like shut off and block
it from the very beginning.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.397 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you've
identified these

00:15:12.397 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:90%
through these energy codes.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.165 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us what those are?

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:10%
And you have new
book out coming.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.647 align:middle line:10%
>>MORTER: Sure, yes, yes.

00:15:19.647 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:10%
In the book, I'm
going to be described

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:10%
I bring that over the
years I codified what

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:10%
was happening with
patients as I started

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:10%
working with energetics.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
About 20 years ago,
I had an experience.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a tremendous awakening,
illuminating experience,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
where I awakened in
entirely different dimension

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
than this physical body
world that we're living in.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I wanted
to return to that state

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:90%
because it was pretty amazing.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a complete
knowing, a complete presence.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing missing.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:90%
It was blissful.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:90%
There was nowhere to go.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to become.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:90%
It was completely complete.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted some
more of that as soon

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
as I came down out
of that experience.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I could see 360
degrees around me

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
in a brilliant
light so bright, it

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
was 10 times brighter
than the brightest day

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%
in the desert I had ever seen.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the
Earth beneath me

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:90%
about the size of a marble.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was embedded into it up to
what would have been my knees.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was just this beautiful
crystalline ray of light.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing experience
that changed my life forever.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Here I was a doctor in case
management, outcomes related,

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:90%
scientific approach to things.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And now I had this experience
that was completely

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:90%
blowing my circuits.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And I had to make
sense out of it.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I had to understand it because
this world didn't explain it.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:84%
The world of science didn't have
a walking, talking explanation

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:90%
for what I had just experienced.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I devoted my
life to figuring out how

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.855 align:middle line:90%
to merge those things together.

00:16:47.855 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
that's the reason

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that I came-- that's the
reason I'm on the planet.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So in that, I began turning my
life into a living laboratory.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And as I would work with
how to return to that state,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.317 align:middle line:84%
I began sharing
it with patients.

00:17:02.317 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And they started
getting better faster

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.983 align:middle line:90%
and staying better longer.

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:90%
And so I started observing this.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:84%
And I began to just codify
what they were doing.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So "The Energy Codes"
are these codification

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that our principles
and practices

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to live from
our creatorship instead

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:90%
of our survivorship--

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:84%
meaning really
trusting who we are

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and building a way
to make that easier,

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.901 align:middle line:90%
accessible for everyone.

00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.692 align:middle line:84%
So all that we talked
about in the beginning

00:17:28.692 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
of re-establishing that
energy and allowing

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
it to flow through
the body, you've

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:84%
been able to decode where
people have the blockages

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and to allow it to flow again.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: And what causes
building of new blockages too.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Once they're
clear, you can just--

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's not just about
clearing what we've already

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
mustered up and collected as
gunk in our lives, et cetera,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:84%
but also really
training our minds

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to find the real us-- this
authentic essential self,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.500 align:middle line:84%
this deep soulful self that
is here underneath the scenes

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.940 align:middle line:90%
and to steward it.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said we're
given this beautiful gift

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:84%
of the intuitive and
this rational mind

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.212 align:middle line:90%
to act as its loyal servant.

00:18:09.212 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And we've created a culture
that honors the servant instead

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:90%
of the gift.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we've been doing.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, we
live in our heads.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.547 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to learn to
live as the intuitive gift

00:18:20.547 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:90%
because that is the truth.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't
think I understand

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
could have created
half that he did

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
without that level of
intuition and brilliance.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes,
absolutely, I agree.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.542 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's take a look here
at Dr. Sue Morter in action.

00:18:31.542 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: So what
we're going to do

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:84%
is use this mechanism
to see what's

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:84%
your storage account
looking like regarding

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.025 align:middle line:84%
your beliefs relative
to these visions

00:18:41.025 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that you wrote down for
yourselves over lunch

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:90%
like you did, I'm sure.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you to
do is just take a moment

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.805 align:middle line:84%
and think about one
of those visions.

00:18:48.805 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to say it out loud.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:84%
But just think this is
something that you would

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:90%
like to hold true for yourself.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So just think of whatever it
would be for you and think it.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And you hold right
here and think

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that thought with
your eyes open first.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Eyes open, think the
thought, push back here--

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.355 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be in a
present tense positive since.

00:19:10.355 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not in the
future, it's now.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.688 align:middle line:84%
You're claiming it as
though it already exists.

00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:90%
So see it already existing.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It is this way or I am
this way-- whatever it is.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.137 align:middle line:84%
Hold right here-- that
was a good effort.

00:19:24.137 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:90%
You're trying really hard.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
That's good, so don't
let me hurt you.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So that just means-- good news,
we can do something about it.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:84%
to give you a better chance
of manifesting that than you

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.967 align:middle line:90%
had before you came up here.

00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So don't be disappointed
that it went weak.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:90%
All right, so makes sense?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to see why
did her arm go weak.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to know
what's up with that.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:84%
She should be able to have
this vision for herself

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:90%
and respond in strength.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Nothing should
short circuit her.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.995 align:middle line:84%
So something is creating
a short circuit.

00:19:54.995 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what it is--

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:90%
so does she

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.523 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to find that out.

00:19:58.523 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Six words-- she's not going
to think about how it applies.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:84%
She's just going to think about
these words-- relax your risk,

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:90%
keep your elbows straight.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hold this opposite
shoulder and push down here.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.158 align:middle line:84%
You guys are going to be
doing this in a moment

00:20:09.158 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:90%
so pay close attention.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
know, what's the deal?

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
What's the interference
here on the line?

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Is it fear?

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Hold here-- is it anger?

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Hold here-- is it love?

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:90%
hold here-- is it sadness?

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Hold here-- may be
some sadness here.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Is it enjoyment?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Hold her-- maybe.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Is it judgment?

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Hold here-- so we had
three that made it go weak.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.077 align:middle line:84%
Now, between those three,
I need more specificity.

00:20:38.077 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:84%
All right, so here's the
beautiful thing about the body.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.310 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly prioritizing.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So now we come in and say
between judgment and enjoyment

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.303 align:middle line:90%
and sadness--

00:20:51.303 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:90%
those were the three, right?

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Sadness, enjoyment, judgment--
that made it go weak.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, am I correct?

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Just was making sure.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:90%
So think of those three--

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to know which
one is in priority.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Is it sadness?

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Is it enjoyment?

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it judgment?

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, we got it down to two?

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Between enjoyment and judgment--
give it to me straight.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:90%
What is it here?

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Is it enjoyment?

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Is it judgment?

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Voila, there we are--

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:90%
pretty fascinating.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are you able to
tell us some of the codes

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.718 align:middle line:84%
and how we can
discover those are

00:21:33.718 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
learned those within ourselves?

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:90%
They're fairly simple, right?

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: The initial ones,
the foundational ones--

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to think that they're

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:84%
going to understand all of
what I'm teaching from this.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But we can initiate some
understanding there absolutely.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And they can have an
experience because of that.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, great, so let's
talk about some of those codes.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.540 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:90%
What are just your basic ones?

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: So there are
some fundamental things

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that an individual can do that
are going to pull them back

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:90%
onto this essential core being.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
things that we can do--

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.880 align:middle line:84%
picture it this
way, we land here.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of
splat, we disperse.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.542 align:middle line:84%
We kind of don't
know what's what.

00:22:16.542 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Our mind goes one way,
our breath goes another,

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:90%
our body goes another way.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're just out here hanging
out trying to make it work.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
we identify as the mind

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.932 align:middle line:84%
that's looking around,
looking outwardly

00:22:27.932 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure
out how to fit in,

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
how to be safe, how to do
the right thing, et cetera.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And our circuits get built in
an externally-oriented fashion.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:84%
In order to reverse
this, we have

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
to direct our circuitry,
our attention,

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:84%
back inward to call all these
parts of us back home again.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And as we do so,
we start to unify.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we unify, we have a
greater power in the world.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:90%
And we can feel ourselves here.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.183 align:middle line:84%
We have a sense of self that
we have never had before.

00:22:54.183 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So think of it like that that
what we're about to practice

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
is pulling ourselves
back home again, landing

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:90%
in the core of the body.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So that mind and body
and breath-- spirit--

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
spirit in the body is
the breath in the body.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So if we can get mind and body
and spirit working together

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.390 align:middle line:84%
again, what happens is a
reorganization of the priority.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer now having
to live from our minds,

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
we can live from our
wholeness-- a unified version.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Otherwise, we're just
disenfranchised all the time

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's those disconnected
pieces of ourselves

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that we leave out there
to grow and develop.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.665 align:middle line:90%
And we don't own them again.

00:23:27.665 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, and with the best
of our efforts, we try so hard

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and we never accomplish
what we're after.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we're working from
a compromised disposition.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not a wholeness.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, so
simple things--

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of wild.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle line:84%
But if we can imagine that
the energy is out here,

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's bigger
than bigger than me,

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:90%
bigger than my physical body.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.535 align:middle line:84%
And I have to like bring it
in and bring some organization

00:23:49.535 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:90%
to it, anchor it.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So that I can
concentrate in my core.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So that I can use that
concentrated energy

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
for purposes of
healing, purposes

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of piercing through veils that
are keeping my personal power

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:84%
from accessing my ability to
experience unconditional love

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and keeping me from
experiencing wisdom

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and connecting that
to my personal power

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and being able to manifest in
all these different energies

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that are housed at
different levels of our body

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
now get to start talking to each
other so that we can be strong

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and we can be loving
at the same time.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
We can be innovative and we can
be wise and maintain a finger

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
on the pulse of what has
traditionally been helpful

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So that we're not throwing the
baby out with the bathwater as

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.328 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to create a
new solution in the world.

00:24:33.328 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So all of this can come
together if we just

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.412 align:middle line:90%
do some of these simple things.

00:24:36.412 --> 00:24:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So one of them is like--
it's kind of wild--

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
but if you think about if you
were going to the bathroom,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.298 align:middle line:84%
and you had to stop the
stream all of a sudden.

00:24:43.298 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to squeeze
certain muscles

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:90%
in the base of the pelvic bowl.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:84%
If you squeeze those
muscles and you

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of lift them up
toward your heart,

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.257 align:middle line:84%
and it might seem kind of
weird to think about doing that

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:90%
the first few times.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you practice
it a few times,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:90%
it becomes second nature.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And it gives the
subconscious an opportunity

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.570 align:middle line:84%
to find a stabilizing presence
inside the core of the body.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
that is important

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.550 align:middle line:84%
is if we don't have a
stabilizing sense of self

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
inside the core of
our being, we start

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.430 align:middle line:84%
creating friction in
our outer world trying

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to figure out who we are.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:84%
If we can create this gentle
tension inside the body,

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:84%
then we can have a sense of
where we are in the universe

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and who we are and
have a sense of self.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And so this simple thing, it's
a root lock exercise-- just

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:84%
locking the energy at
the root of our spine,

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:84%
allows us to start to
develop this, oh, OK, there's

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.720 align:middle line:90%
my reference point.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.053 align:middle line:84%
It's like having
something to hold onto.

00:25:41.053 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's a
grounding piece.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's a
grounding piece.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the
root of our spine.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's at the
tip of the tail bone.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.215 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's a lot of
nerve endings there as well.

00:25:48.215 --> 00:25:49.632 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Tremendous
nerve endings

00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that ironically are
the exact nerves that

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.868 align:middle line:84%
run through the
hips and the pelvis

00:25:52.868 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and the legs and the
feet into the Earth.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
line of communication

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that's trying to happen
between the base of our spine

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and the very Earth
that we walk on

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth's
grounding frequencies

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
are so powerful for
stabilizing our inspirations

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and our intuitions and
our dreams and desires.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:90%
So we need them both.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:90%
We need them both.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:90%
So this root lock is helpful--

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.760 align:middle line:84%
just squeeze these muscles
at the base of the pelvis.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.868 align:middle line:84%
And then hug your
heart on the inside,

00:26:18.868 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:90%
the center of your chest.

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Not just your heart
muscle but in the core--

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:84%
like if you were just
going to squeeze your body,

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.630 align:middle line:84%
make it smaller at the chest
level, smaller front to back

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.460 align:middle line:90%
and smaller side to side.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And then go inside from
there, like inner rings

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:90%
on a tree to the very inside--

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:90%
and just give it a hug.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Just give your heart a hug.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And now this root lock and then
this heart hug just above that.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Then constrict your
throat just a little bit--

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.190 align:middle line:84%
just kind of like a
Darth Vader breath--

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
just kind of like
ujjayi breathing.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're a yogi, you
would understand that term.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And it might sound like
if you're almost snoring,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:84%
what we want is a sound that's
audible for just a moment.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So that the mind
can find where I'm

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be tracking
my attention up

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and down through this central
core channel of the body.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Then let's just roll our
eyes up for a moment,

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:90%
just roll them up.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel a slight
tension behind your eyes?

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Just use that tension point
as another anchoring point

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
as if we were going to
drop a plumb line straight

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.627 align:middle line:84%
down through the central
core of the body,

00:27:22.627 --> 00:27:24.960 align:middle line:84%
from the top of the head
through the center of the brain

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.050 align:middle line:84%
through that tension spot behind
your eyes and relax your eyes.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But memorize that place
in the center of the brain

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and then breathe so that
you can hear your breath.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And then hug your
heart and then squeeze

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:90%
at the root of the spine.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of try
it all on at once.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.632 align:middle line:84%
It's going to feel
awkward at first.

00:27:40.632 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It feels contracting.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: All right, so then
take a breath from the Earth.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.532 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that you're
breathing up into your belly

00:27:48.532 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and hug your heart right
in the middle of that.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And then exhale right up
through your throat and right up

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:90%
through the center of the brain.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Exhale through your nose
and shoot the breath right

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.300 align:middle line:84%
out the top of your
head just like a dolphin

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:90%
would out of a blowhole.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, this is
a measurable reality

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
channel of energy that

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.520 align:middle line:90%
moves through the human system.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It'll drop the shoulders,
and it will relax you now.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Find that whole
plum line again--

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.350 align:middle line:84%
these four anchor points--
just eyes, throat, heart,

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.040 align:middle line:90%
root to the spine.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Fine that line, imagine it,
and take a breath from overhead

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and breathe right
down into your belly.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And let it feel good
while it's coming through

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and then exhale right
through your nose.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, just shoot it right
down through your body

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.630 align:middle line:90%
and into the Earth.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Just inhale and exhaling
through the nose

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
picks up power moving the
breath through the turbulence

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:84%
in the sinuses
propels that breath

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom
lobes of the lungs,

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:84%
which activates the
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
which is just the
part that relaxes.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.735 align:middle line:84%
So it sends a signal
into the nervous system,

00:28:51.735 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:90%
just by how we're breathe--

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Everything's OK

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.848 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: --that all is well.

00:28:54.848 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to chill out now.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
We can use this
energy differently

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.180 align:middle line:90%
than we've been using it before.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.868 align:middle line:84%
And exhaling into
the earth then again.

00:29:01.868 --> 00:29:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is called a
central channel breath.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a very foundational
way to begin

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
moving energy through the
body in an organized fashion.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And we teach lots
of details on top

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:84%
of that to allow
someone to recognize

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
why I'm upset in a
particular situation, what

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I need to do differently
so that I'm not

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.910 align:middle line:90%
upset in this situation.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:24.720 align:middle line:10%
Because upsets, frustrations--
those kinds of issues

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:10%
occur in our lives
because we don't

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.570 align:middle line:10%
have the circuitry in
our system hooked up

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:10%
to allow our wisdom and our
love and our personal power

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:10%
and our ability to manifest
our sense of self all connected

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.980 align:middle line:10%
to each other.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
reactive response

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:84%
to things that happen in life
that cause us to just explode.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, especially, with
things like anger or tension

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and stress locked
in the body, there's

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:90%
no way for that to escape.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It just stays.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.803 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, what I
want people to realize

00:29:58.803 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle line:84%
is that those energies
are good energies.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:05.310 align:middle line:84%
They're just not connected with
where they're supposed to go.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So they route into
explosive emotional states

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know what to
do with the energy instead.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:84%
But that is so much
power in that energy

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
if we knew how to
route it and that's

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:90%
what I want people to learn.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But also
people anesthetize it.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They drink it or they
drug it or they quiet it

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:84%
in some way that turns--
because they can't handle it.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Because they're
not utilizing it the way

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.465 align:middle line:84%
that it's supposed
to be utilized.

00:30:30.465 --> 00:30:31.455 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Isn't that great?

00:30:31.455 --> 00:30:33.705 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's like stepping
behind the wheel of a car

00:30:33.705 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:90%
or sitting down behind a car--

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.390 align:middle line:90%
a race car.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:40.198 align:middle line:84%
And throwing it in drive and
throwing your foot on the gas

00:30:40.198 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and letting go of
the steering wheel.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of scary.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.547 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of doing that,
it's like, get me out of here.

00:30:45.547 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking for
all kinds of ways

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:51.575 align:middle line:84%
to dampen or
anesthetize discomfort

00:30:51.575 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:84%
of being in the Ferrari
that's headed down the road

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:90%
with no one in charge.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what's happening.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This should be
taught in addiction clinics

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and so forth how to reach
channel that energy.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, we are working
with that kind of application

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:90%
of the work currently.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We're working to
get into helping

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.400 align:middle line:84%
people to come off of
prescription medications

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:84%
as well as the other drugs that
are not helping our culture

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
progress forwardly in
a functional manner.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Interesting,
and you also

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.793 align:middle line:90%
integrate yoga into your world.

00:31:26.793 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And we have some
beautiful pictures here

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.216 align:middle line:84%
of you doing yoga on the
wall, and it's beautiful.

00:31:33.216 --> 00:31:35.057 align:middle line:90%
Where is that?

00:31:35.057 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Well, there
are many, many things.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.900 align:middle line:84%
We take sacred journeys
around the world

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.600 align:middle line:84%
to sacred sites
because of the energies

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:90%
that exist at sacred sites.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It's important to recognize
that the temples like

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids and Machu Picchu
and the temples across India,

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.360 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, all over the
world, Easter Island as well--

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.440 align:middle line:84%
those temples are built
where they are built because

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:90%
of the energetic of the planet.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the temples hold
that energy and reverberated

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.088 align:middle line:90%
and magnify it even more.

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the people that have
been going to the temples

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and accentuating their
honoring of the divine nature

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and those resources
that are available to us

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.140 align:middle line:90%
have magnified it even more.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So when we go there
we are enhanced.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We're in an environment
where we can

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:23.150 align:middle line:84%
start to stabilize because
the energy frequency is such

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:90%
that it is.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And yoga is the creation of a
temple within our own system.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
When we put the body in
certain sacred geometries,

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:36.770 align:middle line:84%
certain positions, it creates
a pattern of energy flow

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:84%
through the body
automatically enhancing

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.090 align:middle line:84%
its natural multi-dimensionality
that the human system is

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:90%
designed to be accessing.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just
living in our heads

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make
life work, we start

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:54.320 align:middle line:84%
to learn to capitalize
upon the benefits of yoga.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Yoga brings mind, body, breath
back together again as well.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And many of the true
necessity for yoga

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and the true message
behind yoga--

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.440 align:middle line:90%
many times it is lost.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And we just think it's
about becoming flexible--

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.510 align:middle line:90%
those are beautiful byproducts.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Becoming slimmer and
fit and more flexible

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
are beautiful byproduct
products of yoga.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But yoga was really
intended to traverse energy

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:84%
through the body so that we
could wake up in our high brain

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:84%
centers to our creativity rather
than being stuck in our lower

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.485 align:middle line:84%
brain centers operating from
a place of fear and survival.

00:33:30.485 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, so really
yoga poses are essentially

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.782 align:middle line:90%
sacred geometry.

00:33:33.782 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: They are
putting the body

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:84%
in sacred geometrical
shapes that

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.280 align:middle line:84%
allow the energy to
activate certain meridians

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and nadis, just the
ways that energy

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.950 align:middle line:84%
flows through the
body in bioenergetics.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It allows the
enhancement of that flow.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So that we can move out of
a state of fear and survival

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.130 align:middle line:84%
into a state of
well-being and creativity

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:90%
and genius, our creative genius.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:01.520 align:middle line:10%
I teach an entire system of yoga
called Body Awake Yoga, where

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:10%
we are using yoga
to help us awaken

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.350 align:middle line:10%
to the true essential self, not
just getting through the poses

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:10%
but recognizing that how
this has been a fitting me

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.199 align:middle line:10%
and what it's doing for
my endocrine system,

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:10%
my nervous system, my
lymphatic system, of course,

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:10%
but even more, awakening me
to the true essential self,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:10%
the soulful self, the
truth of who I am.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:84%
But we are here, the
world is in our favor.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:29.989 align:middle line:90%
This is meant to be.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is happening
in our lives

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
is here in the support
of our recognizing

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:90%
our own magnificence.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:84%
And when things happen
that don't feel like that,

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.630 align:middle line:84%
it's really easy to just splat
again and jump up in our heads

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and try to figure out why
this is happening to me

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and try to name
why that's so wrong

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
and then try to strategize on
how to survive the wrongness

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:90%
that I'm facing everyday.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:84%
And all of that is a
waste of our energy.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.210 align:middle line:84%
It is not our purpose
for being here.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Our purpose for being here is
to awaken to our creatorship

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize that
we belong, fully wholly,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and that there is
nothing happening other

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:84%
than the universe
trying to support us

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.760 align:middle line:90%
in that exact project.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So when things go
differently than we thought,

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:84%
if we weren't so
addicted to control,

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
we would be able to
recognize, oh, there's

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:84%
a reason it's going the
way that it's going.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm teaching people--
and I can share another little

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.135 align:middle line:84%
exercise at some point
if that works for--

00:35:24.135 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Around
self-doubt or something,

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
when we do doubt that.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, exactly--
something goes differently

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:84%
than we thought it was
going to and we get upset

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.770 align:middle line:90%
or we get afraid.

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And then our
reaction is OK I have

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to control my
environment because I'm

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:90%
freaked out right here.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I've got to control my
environment so that I'm safe,

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:41.990 align:middle line:90%
so that I'm OK.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
addicted to control.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
living in our heads,

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.535 align:middle line:84%
our heads aren't
connected to our bodies.

00:35:47.535 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:84%
We're living in our
minds and our minds

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:90%
aren't connected to the body.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And as the mind becomes
connected to the body,

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:90%
it starts to slow down.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.630 align:middle line:90%
It starts to get real.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It starts to get clear, a more
rational way of processing

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.420 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when something happens
that isn't what we anticipated

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:84%
or isn't what we
thought we wanted,

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.840 align:middle line:90%
the invitation is this--

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.850 align:middle line:84%
rather than jump
to the conclusion

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:84%
that that is happening not in my
favor and that it's against me,

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.490 align:middle line:84%
just assume that
this is in my favor.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And instead of asking
why is this happening

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:84%
or why do you do that or
all of the stuff that we do,

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:23.980 align:middle line:84%
just take your mind's
attention to the body.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And the body is
going to tell you why

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.800 align:middle line:90%
this is happening in your life.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.648 align:middle line:84%
The body is going to tell the
mind why this is happening.

00:36:30.648 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So I shouldn't say the
body is going to tell you.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Because we are not supposed
to be identified as our mind.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.740 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to be the spirit
that has a body and has a mind

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And so if I can train my
mind to come onto the body,

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use those
two tools so that I

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
can express as the intuitive
out into the world--

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.740 align:middle line:84%
as the magnificent soulful
being that Einstein

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:84%
was speaking about out into
the world without hesitation.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So if I can't do
that automatically,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:57.870 align:middle line:90%
there's a reason.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's because I don't have
the neurocircuitry in place

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.290 align:middle line:84%
to be able to process
what's going on here.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It's blowing my circuits.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So instead of asking
why is this happening,

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:90%
ask where is this happening?

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And what you're going
to find is there's

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:84%
going to be a charge in
your throat or in your chest

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.390 align:middle line:90%
or in your gut.

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere there's going to
be a charge of energy that's

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.260 align:middle line:84%
hitting up against a blockage
or a gap that doesn't have

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.530 align:middle line:84%
the circuits in place to let
that energy flow right back up

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:33.110 align:middle line:84%
through us and arrive at our
conscious level unaltered.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not getting there.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And so we freak out.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.030 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting the
message that all is well

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's getting blocked in
the gut or blocked in the chest

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:44.210 align:middle line:84%
or blocked in the throat
before it ever arises up here

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.070 align:middle line:84%
into where we can
perceive what's going on.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you get a
knot in your throat,

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.540 align:middle line:90%
there's a good reason for it.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.210 align:middle line:84%
If you get a knot in your
chest, a knot in your gut,

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:54.510 align:middle line:90%
there's a good reason for it.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.580 align:middle line:90%
It's in your favor.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But what we do as
a culture is we

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.020 align:middle line:84%
exit if it creates
such discomfort.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying stay the
course, come back home,

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.760 align:middle line:90%
do not leave home.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if you'll come
here and see where

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:90%
the knot is and squeeze it back.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're
in the situation

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.925 align:middle line:84%
where you're up
against something

00:38:12.925 --> 00:38:13.880 align:middle line:90%
that's upsetting you--

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.560 align:middle line:90%
take your attention to the body.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I call it, "take
it to the body."

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Very creative term--
take it to the body

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and squeeze back
whatever you feel.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.680 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a knot in
your throat right then,

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.230 align:middle line:84%
squeeze the throat and squeeze
these four anchor points

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that we were just
working with earlier

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and start breathing up and
down your central channel.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Until you can start to feel the
throat or the chest or the gut,

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:84%
wherever this extra energy
is charged and blocked

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.580 align:middle line:84%
until you can start to
feel it release and flow

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:84%
into this central
channel breathing

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:47.750 align:middle line:90%
that we've been doing.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that,
we build circuitry

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:84%
for this energy to
no longer become

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.160 align:middle line:90%
interfered with or blocked.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know, you feel OK.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:90%
And you don't know why.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.077 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: See now that's
great because in the past,

00:39:02.077 --> 00:39:04.160 align:middle line:84%
when I've gotten the
messages from the body of you

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.287 align:middle line:84%
need to slow down,
I automatically

00:39:06.287 --> 00:39:07.370 align:middle line:90%
say, well, there's no way.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And I argue with myself.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can't do this
and this didn't--

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and I just go right
back into the mental.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying feel where slow
down would locate in my body--

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.353 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Well, when
you say, there's no way.

00:39:19.353 --> 00:39:20.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't say slow down.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
You get the message that says
slow down and then your head

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:90%
says I can't--

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.215 align:middle line:90%

No, we-- this is what

We're all dealing with this.

So in that moment where
we say, I can't stop.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:36.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.003 align:middle line:84%
I can't if I do
that, then I drop all

00:39:38.003 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Not just in the head?

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MORTER: Because it's
a limiting belief.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's not
in the head, it's

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.620 align:middle line:90%
really going to be in the body?

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.912 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It's going to show
you something in your body

00:40:09.912 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that if you built the circuits
at that place in your body,

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.850 align:middle line:84%
you would no longer believe
you can't slow down.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Fascinating--
so you could find it

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.750 align:middle line:10%
in your gallbladder or
something and then it's--

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:10%
>>MORTER: And you even have
to know the name of it.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:24.115 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's this
organ or what's that?

00:40:24.115 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Just squeeze it.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.460 align:middle line:90%
You have to talk body talk.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.080 align:middle line:84%
If you squeeze it,
now the body knows

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that the mind has found the
message that the body has

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.590 align:middle line:90%
been trying to tell the mind.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.423 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:40:34.423 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:90%
The soul speaks to the body.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And the body speaks to the mind.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And the mind doesn't listen.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.070 align:middle line:90%
So we're disconnected.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.510 align:middle line:90%
So now we're saying, OK, mind--

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:90%
listen.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the body because
it's speaking a language to you

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that the real me
is trying to say.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm in here, and I'm giving
these messages to the body.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And the mind has to learn how
to perceive me, has to find me--

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.180 align:middle line:84%
the real me, the
essential soulful self.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when we're
dealing with a big subject

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.290 align:middle line:90%
of, say, breast cancer.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And one in eight women get
breast cancer-- in some way,

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.310 align:middle line:90%
cancerous cells activate.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.500 align:middle line:84%
How do you connect
this information

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.127 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about to that?

00:41:14.127 --> 00:41:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: You don't
even have to know.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.110 align:middle line:84%
You just say when
you think about--

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.750 align:middle line:84%
someone's already been
diagnosed, let's say.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:84%
When they think
about the diagnosis--

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.150 align:middle line:90%
like here it is.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:25.080 align:middle line:90%
It's devastating.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It's terrifying me.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
It's doing all the
things that it's doing.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is-- all
of those things--

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.090 align:middle line:84%
when I think those thoughts
and have these feelings,

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:36.090 align:middle line:90%
where in my body am I activated?

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And it might not take
you to the breast.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.450 align:middle line:90%
It might take you to the gut.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:41.145 align:middle line:84%
It might take you
to the stomach.

00:41:41.145 --> 00:41:42.520 align:middle line:84%
It might take you
to your throat,

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:90%
to your chest, something.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It originated somewhere along
the central core of your body.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And if we squeeze that back and
start breathing a nurturing,

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:56.070 align:middle line:84%
loving, come home
to yourself, kind

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:59.190 align:middle line:84%
of intimate, precious,
sacred breath--

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Communication.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Connect the mind onto
the body in a loving presence

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.400 align:middle line:90%
kind of way.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.440 align:middle line:84%
What begins to happen
is we start to build

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.900 align:middle line:90%
the circuitry for self-healing.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And when self-healing
is present, cancers,

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:84%
degenerative
diseases, arthritis's,

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.010 align:middle line:84%
all of these chronic
conditions begin

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:24.600 align:middle line:84%
to turn around because
they exist because

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.380 align:middle line:84%
of a cellular
implosion or eruption

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:33.360 align:middle line:84%
due to energetic blockages
that are overstimulating cells

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.080 align:middle line:84%
or understimulating cells
in such a dramatic way

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.802 align:middle line:90%
that breakdown is occurring.

00:42:38.802 --> 00:42:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you see this in
your clinic all the time,

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:90%
people coming with this.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And they actually reverse it?

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: They
actually reverse it.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are only
three legal ways

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.240 align:middle line:90%
to treat cancer in our country.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is radiation,
medication, and surgery.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:58.202 align:middle line:84%
And so we're treating
the whole person.

00:42:58.202 --> 00:42:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we treat the
whole person, which

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.700 align:middle line:84%
is what we were talking about
earlier in this conversation,

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.830 align:middle line:90%
healing starts to happen.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:08.040 align:middle line:84%
When the whole person unifies
and awakens and energies

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.890 align:middle line:84%
start moving again that have
been shut down, blocked,

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:13.350 align:middle line:84%
or shut out or
never even activated

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:15.480 align:middle line:84%
because of the environment
that we were raised in,

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:84%
we never even gave ourselves
permission-- things

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle line:90%
begin to change.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You explain it
in such a beautiful way

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that I completely can
see how that would work.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:84%
If you take this concept
onto a global level,

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.130 align:middle line:84%
think about the
cancers in our world

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and how the disease is
happening and the planet

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and the destruction and
the pollution and humanity

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.100 align:middle line:90%
in some cases--

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:84%
you can really start to
communicate and establish

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:84%
a healthy connection back with
those pieces of our planet

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.680 align:middle line:90%
that are ailing.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this through
meditation, can't you?

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It is
so amazing, we're

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.480 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
power of the mind.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, it just
brings tears to my eyes.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.900 align:middle line:10%
Just think about this.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The power of the mind,
when it kicks into neutral

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and becomes the observing
mind and the stewarding mind

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.810 align:middle line:84%
to this beautiful,
soulful self, we

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.660 align:middle line:84%
tap into an entirely
different bandwidth

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.100 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And that bandwidth of
human consciousness

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:90%
encircles the planet.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we tap into
the bandwidth of unity

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and possibility
and loving devotion

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and come home for
ourselves, what happens

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is we emit that
vibrational frequency

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.290 align:middle line:84%
into the entire bandwidth
of human consciousness.

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And so someone on the
other side of the planet

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.220 align:middle line:84%
has a loving experience, and
they don't even know why.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Because you're changing
the radio station

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.650 align:middle line:90%
that everyone is dialed into.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And the higher the frequency,
which happens the more we

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.690 align:middle line:84%
embody, we raise the
vibration of frequency.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:84%
When we become
what it is that we

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.500 align:middle line:84%
want to have happen
in the world,

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:84%
it emits in such a foundational
radio station that everyone

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.230 align:middle line:90%
is impacted by it.

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be in the body
to actually accomplish that.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.290 align:middle line:84%
We can't do it with
the mind alone.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can see why
you do what you do.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Because every person that you
connect with their body again,

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.497 align:middle line:84%
you're essentially
connecting the Earth again.

00:45:15.497 --> 00:45:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MORTER: It changes the planet.

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It goes back
to your NDE where

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:25.470 align:middle line:84%
you were able to see the entire
planet and your polar affect

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:26.410 align:middle line:90%
of that planet.

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, I saw that
there's only one thing

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:29.520 align:middle line:90%
happening here.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And it is light
coming into form.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.640 align:middle line:90%
And it is goodness.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
reframe our perception

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.800 align:middle line:90%
until it looks that way to us.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And the ways to do it are
these codified fashions

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that I've found to work right
here in this little laboratory

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that each one of us
has in such a fashion

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:90%
that it is sustainable.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.930 align:middle line:90%
And it is the real thing.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And it goes on
exponentially forever.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Even when we're not
thinking of it anymore,

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:00.060 align:middle line:84%
when we're connecting these
dots in these circuits

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're living
as this, our minds

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:06.090 align:middle line:84%
are now free to go on creating
things rather than having

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:08.490 align:middle line:84%
to constantly think
about how we wish

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.110 align:middle line:90%
it was different in the world.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:84%
We become a peaceful
presence that

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.410 align:middle line:84%
brings a unifying quality,
not just to the person

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.540 align:middle line:84%
standing next to us
but exponentially

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.450 align:middle line:84%
into the entire bandwidth
of human consciousness.

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.618 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that what
the quantum flip is?

00:46:23.618 --> 00:46:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: That is what
the quantum flip is.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is it?

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: The quantum flip
is an entire paradigm shift.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.550 align:middle line:84%
It's an entire reality
shift, recognizing

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.870 align:middle line:90%
that we are quantum beings.

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.130 align:middle line:90%
We are not linear beings.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:37.100 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to
learn to use the mind

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:40.100 align:middle line:84%
in only a linear fashion,
which we have done so far.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.150 align:middle line:90%
And we're good at it.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:42.980 align:middle line:84%
We have to add some
additional elements.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And the new science
is bringing forward

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:50.450 align:middle line:84%
this reality that says what
you think about comes about,

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:54.200 align:middle line:84%
what you perceive is the
reality that you are living in.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have to learn to perceive
from this place of all as well.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.070 align:middle line:84%
We are truly capable of
more than we can believe.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.200 align:middle line:84%
All of our beliefs
are limiting beliefs--

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.160 align:middle line:90%
all of them are.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn
to train ourselves

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:12.500 align:middle line:84%
to become present rather than
be the believing machine that we

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.392 align:middle line:90%
think we are.

00:47:13.392 --> 00:47:16.790 align:middle line:84%
We just have to train
ourselves to become present.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.847 align:middle line:84%
And when we're present,
we're available to make

00:47:19.847 --> 00:47:20.930 align:middle line:90%
a difference in the world.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can we unbelieve things?

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Sure, you can kick
into this place of presence

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:29.630 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And the beliefs that have
been driving our lives,

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.900 align:middle line:84%
they start to fade and
disassemble themselves

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.670 align:middle line:90%
if we're no longer feeding them.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:40.490 align:middle line:84%
When we tap a higher frequency
and are running that frequency

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.752 align:middle line:84%
through this toric field
flow that I was describing

00:47:43.752 --> 00:47:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that drops down through
the body into the Earth

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and rises up out the head
and around and around again--

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.680 align:middle line:84%
when that energy becomes
more robust and of a higher

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.890 align:middle line:84%
frequency, the mental
body the, mind field

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:57.720 align:middle line:84%
starts to soften
in its presence.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And it just becomes
available, instead

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.280 align:middle line:84%
of continuing to think it has
to drive and affirm and validate

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.460 align:middle line:90%
those beliefs.

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So then the beliefs are
no longer being fed.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And they start to dissolve
in fashions as they are

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:13.910 align:middle line:90%
stored in subconscious memory.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is this what you do?

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure you get
stuck every now and then.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.240 align:middle line:84%
You have an incredibly
busy travel schedule.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And you do events and
workshops and everything.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.310 align:middle line:90%
You work with people.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.017 align:middle line:90%
Don't you get stuck?

00:48:27.017 --> 00:48:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: When I get
stuck, what's happening

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.150 align:middle line:84%
is I'm bumping up against
the reasons that I came.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm bumping up
against the reasons

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.460 align:middle line:90%
that I came here to evolve.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I get that if I'm
stuck in this moment,

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.160 align:middle line:84%
I have to take it to the body
and see where the circuitry is

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.970 align:middle line:84%
compromised if I ever want to
get through this stuckness.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So what used to take me
years to wrap my mind around,

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:55.810 align:middle line:84%
what was going on I can
truly shift in an instant.

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:57.980 align:middle line:84%
If in that moment
where I historically

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.730 align:middle line:84%
would have reacted or gotten
into my protective personality

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and duked it out,
I drop in, find

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.770 align:middle line:90%
where the circuits are not.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
charge in my body.

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:10.250 align:middle line:90%
And I squeeze it back.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I breathe up and down with
this gracious loving presence

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.570 align:middle line:90%
as soon as I can.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:17.165 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in the moment-- it's
hard to find loving presence.

00:49:17.165 --> 00:49:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, if you're
angry or if you're--

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Good news is
it's not time dependent.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:23.840 align:middle line:84%
When you get in bed that night,
pick up where you left off,

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.593 align:middle line:84%
pick up where you
splatted and do the work

00:49:25.593 --> 00:49:26.510 align:middle line:90%
and build the circuit.

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So that the next time, it
doesn't have a hold of you.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what if
you see injustices

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:33.560 align:middle line:84%
in the world of other
people doing horrible things

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.325 align:middle line:90%
to other people or to you?

00:49:36.325 --> 00:49:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: So you
know what I know

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.360 align:middle line:90%
is that we can take action.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But we have to take action
from a place of wholeness.

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.840 align:middle line:84%
We can't take action from
a place of reactivity.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.163 align:middle line:84%
Mother Teresa would
always march for peace,

00:49:47.163 --> 00:49:48.830 align:middle line:84%
but she would never
marched against war.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:49.892 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like this.

00:49:49.892 --> 00:49:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So if there is anger and
frustration about what we're

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.950 align:middle line:84%
seeing in the world, take it to
the body, build the circuits,

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.310 align:middle line:84%
come home to yourself, and step
into whatever conversations

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.020 align:middle line:84%
or whatever actions
we want to take

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:84%
from a place of integration,
of an interwovenness of mind,

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:05.780 align:middle line:90%
body, spirit.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So that the vibration of
what comes out of your mouth

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:13.640 align:middle line:84%
has a grounded and elevated
simultaneously frequency to it.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So that it has an
opportunity to disassemble

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.470 align:middle line:84%
the distortions
that are happening

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:90%
in these parts of the world.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.580 align:middle line:90%
And also take a look--

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:26.450 align:middle line:84%
take a look-- when we are
upset about something that's

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.130 align:middle line:84%
happening in the
world, take a look

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and see am I doing that to
me somewhere inside of here?

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Is this happening inside of
my little laboratory too?

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if it is and
then I sit with that,

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and I build some circuits--
meaning squeeze it and breathe

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:44.180 align:middle line:84%
through when I think about
how I feel about the fact

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.250 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing
that to myself too.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Then I start to
build the circuitry

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.520 align:middle line:90%
to not do it to myself anymore.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I don't, I impact
that entire bandwidth

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.020 align:middle line:90%
that's encircling the globe.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So I have an opportunity to make
a change on something that's

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.440 align:middle line:90%
happening continents away.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.530 align:middle line:84%
If I see that it's a
holographic universe

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening over
there is happening in here,

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:09.480 align:middle line:84%
because there's actually no
such difference as over there

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.280 align:middle line:90%
and in here.

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's fascinating
I've been obsessed

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:18.500 align:middle line:84%
with the suicides lately
and really passionately

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.680 align:middle line:84%
hurting for these people,
where I want to help them.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.550 align:middle line:84%
No one in my life has ever
committed suicide that I know,

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:29.570 align:middle line:84%
but I really am
concerned about this.

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And I started saying
that to myself.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what is
it inside of me that

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.500 align:middle line:84%
wants to end something,
that wants to end something

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.350 align:middle line:84%
not going right or
wants to end something?

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And really started to
look at that inside myself

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:43.250 align:middle line:90%
and I started to reveal things.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:44.912 align:middle line:84%
Oh, wow, this really
isn't working.

00:51:44.912 --> 00:51:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really need don't
to do it this way anymore.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute, I need to
rethink this whole thing.

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
do that, I started

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to look at things that
really that I was just

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.320 align:middle line:84%
doing on remote control
that were no longer working

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:02.690 align:middle line:84%
or what I needed in me and have
a death about to no longer do.

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: And that's a
beautiful way to look at it.

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I would
encourage someone

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.970 align:middle line:84%
who can't find the
wisdom, perspective

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:14.450 align:middle line:84%
like you were able to
in that is to simply

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:20.630 align:middle line:84%
say, how do I feel
when I give up,

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:24.590 align:middle line:84%
when I just walk away,
when I disconnect or become

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.200 align:middle line:84%
apathetic or think,
there's no way.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.450 align:middle line:90%
This is never going to change.

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:27.950 align:middle line:90%
There's no hope.

00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:28.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.850 align:middle line:84%
When I have that thought, where
in my body am I activated.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And if it takes me to
my throat when there's

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:middle line:84%
hopelessness, if it
takes me to my chest,

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.150 align:middle line:90%
if it takes me to my gut--

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:39.740 align:middle line:90%
squeeze it back.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And let it know I'm not
leaving you this time.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm not abandoning
you this time.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.960 align:middle line:10%
Let the mind no longer
abandon the soul

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.580 align:middle line:10%
and give up and walk away.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.655 align:middle line:84%
Let the mind come back home
and stay home, squeeze it,

00:52:52.655 --> 00:52:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and start to breathe up and down
through this central channel--

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.600 align:middle line:90%
this home base--

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and allow the soulful self to
have a strong hold on the mind.

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So that the mind
doesn't just quit.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Because when the mind quits--

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.970 align:middle line:84%
initially, it can
happen through apathy

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:09.430 align:middle line:90%
and that's painful to us.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But this is such
a great answer for--

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:13.680 align:middle line:84%
not that there's one
answer to suicide--

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:18.807 align:middle line:84%
but that return to home,
that connection with home.

00:53:18.807 --> 00:53:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: Yes, I've
worked with people

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:90%
that were raised in cults.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I myself in years
past was involved

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.790 align:middle line:84%
in something that was
very similar to that

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and was not a healthy
place in a time when

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I was reaching and searching.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I grew up with these
amazing principles, and there

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.290 align:middle line:90%
was a missing element for me.

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And just prior to putting
these pieces together,

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I was searching in a big
way, in a dramatic way.

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And in that, stumbled
into an environment

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:48.950 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't healthy.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:50.780 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
manipulation and lying

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and just all kinds of things
that people get engaged in.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized that
what's not happening here

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.130 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm not
coming home for me.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn
how to do that.

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:05.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a great impetus
for the foundation

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.270 align:middle line:84%
of this work and putting all
the pieces back together--

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:09.687 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Isn't it
incredible how we

00:54:09.687 --> 00:54:11.230 align:middle line:90%
create that level of contrast?

00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And I ask all of my
guests that biggest

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.278 align:middle line:90%
why that you do what you do.

00:54:15.278 --> 00:54:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
try not to cry here.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so beautiful.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.200 align:middle line:90%
I can so see your why.

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Can you share it with us?

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:26.260 align:middle line:90%


00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It is because it's
the only thing that matters.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Doing mind, body,
breath reunion--

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.590 align:middle line:10%
it's the reunion of
the human spirit.

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And as we are able to be here
as the spirit beings that we are

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and be here fully, then
this life experiences

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is everything that
it is meant to be.

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I will never not
be doing this work.

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:45.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the way really.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to find
our own expression

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.150 align:middle line:90%
of what we're here to do.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised
in an environment

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.380 align:middle line:90%
that had so many answers.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
amazing information

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.208 align:middle line:84%
that was talked about
at our dinner table.

00:54:58.208 --> 00:54:59.750 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about quantum science

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.150 align:middle line:84%
before it was ever even
talked about out in the world

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and printed in the journals.

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And yet there were
aspects of that truth

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:11.750 align:middle line:84%
that that didn't completely
explain everything

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:15.230 align:middle line:84%
that happened in my life
when I started meditating

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and had these larger
than life experiences.

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.890 align:middle line:10%
And so I had to come
to terms with the fact

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:25.730 align:middle line:10%
that sometimes we have to go
beyond what we've been trained

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.590 align:middle line:10%
and what our cultural
norm would say

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:30.410 align:middle line:10%
and what our own family
dynamic believes in

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.190 align:middle line:10%
and follow our path in order
to do what we're here to do.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:36.777 align:middle line:90%
And that is true for everyone.

00:55:36.777 --> 00:55:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, for anyone
who is in that situation--

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I can see you around
the dinner table.

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:44.765 align:middle line:84%
I'm a bioenergetics-- feeling
all, intuiting all, going wait,

00:55:44.765 --> 00:55:47.390 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make quite-- that's not
the full picture I want to tell

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:48.290 align:middle line:90%
you, but I can't.

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: And then
later in life, we

00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:51.582 align:middle line:84%
go through enough
experiences that we start

00:55:51.582 --> 00:55:52.920 align:middle line:90%
to put the pieces together.

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when we give
ourselves permission

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to reveal what we putting
together for ourselves

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and have a trusted
relationship with the universe

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:03.080 align:middle line:84%
then what gets to happen
is we bring our gifts.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and it
all unfolds perfectly.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.120 align:middle line:84%
When we look at it in
hindsight, it's all exactly

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:08.995 align:middle line:90%
the way it should be.

00:56:08.995 --> 00:56:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: It was
all in divine order.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, it was.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for showing us what

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:17.570 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of coming back
home into our body really is

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and how to practically
connect back to home.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
watching this show.

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Your energy makes these
shows happen, so thanks

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.687 align:middle line:90%
for being here as well.

00:56:28.687 --> 00:56:31.020 align:middle line:10%
And if you want to watch more
inspirational programming,

I'm Lisa Garr, and
until next time,

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.730 align:middle line:10%
I invite you to stay aware.
