00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:84%
This is Lisa Garr, host
of Gaiam Inspirations.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We are coming to you live
from the Gaiam Studios

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:90%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
And since this is a
live interactive show,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:10%
we encourage you to communicate
with us on Facebook and Twitter

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:10%
and let us know your
thoughts, ask our question--

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:10%
ask our guests live
questions on the air,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:10%
and we'll come back to
you with the answers.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:10%
All right, so today we are
talking about superfoods.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about the foods
that are a complete protein,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:10%
and that they are some of the
most powerful, mineral-rich,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.540 align:middle line:10%
plant-based foods on Earth.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And they've been used by ancient
civilizations long before ours.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is David Wolfe.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
He is one of the
world's top authorities

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
on natural health,
nutrition, chocolate,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.185 align:middle line:90%
and organic superfoods.

00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show, David.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID WOLFE: Thank you.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, excellent.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: It's great, always.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So tell me,
what is a superfood,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:84%
for people who have
not heard about them.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.777 align:middle line:10%
>> WOLFE: A superfood would
be the most powerful food that

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:10%
a civilization has identified
in their ecosystem.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:10%
For example, the
Polynesians identified

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:10%
noni, the super fruit, noni.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptians, aloe vera,
the Chinese, the goji berry,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:10%
the Central American shamans
and South American shamans,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:10%
the cacao bean.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:10%
In the Andes, it was maca.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And these are foods
that they sustain their entire

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:90%
cultures on.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Right, they
were usually the center

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
of the medicine wheel of
that culture and their herbal

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
in Central America,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:90%
cacao is at the center.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So all your herbal medicaments
that you would use,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.375 align:middle line:84%
whether it's cayenne pepper or
whether it was piper ornatum,

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
or whatever interesting
herb they were using,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.993 align:middle line:90%
always went through chocolate.

00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:90%
That's how it was delivered.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.098 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Usually
bitter, actually.

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, you have the--
and we're going to be doing

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:84%
an amazing drink
demonstration later with some

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:90%
of David's exclusive recipes.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So get your pens and
paper ready for that one.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:90%
But so the raw cacao nut.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Nut.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a nut, botanically.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's a nut, right?

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yes.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And that's where
chocolate is derived from.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: That's right.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.482 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We're going to
go a lot into this later.

00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
But so this is a
complete superfood?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.598 align:middle line:90%
This has protein in it?

00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:22.398 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:02:22.398 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not the
best source of protein.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's not as much protein
as spirulina, for example.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But spirulina and chocolate
were eaten together

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
by the ancient Mexicans
and ancient Toltecs

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and Olmecs and Mayans
for thousands of years.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:84%
All right, so show us what
some of the superfoods are.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: OK, well
let's go through,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and we'll look at
some images here.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:90%
We've got maca right there.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Maca is the highest altitude
crop in the new world.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's only probably
a few medicaments

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
worldwide that are
at that elevation.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.625 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
16,000 feet elevation--

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Where is it grown?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.708 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: --that level.

00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's in the Andes.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And maca is in the
cruciferous vegetable family.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the same family
as broccoli and wild mustard,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and cauliflower, and
brussels sprouts.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.365 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So
cancer-fighting food?

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:06.367 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Very powerful.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's-- actually any
food that's able to survive

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.435 align:middle line:84%
at that atmospheric level
is usually very powerful.

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
Chinese medicine,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:84%
cordyceps comes from
that level of altitude.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Rhodiola comes from that
level of altitude, snow lotus.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And then in the new
world, it's maca.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:90%
But maca has calories.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:90%
So you can actually eat it.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:90%
You can bite into it.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You can buy it fresh
in the markets in Peru.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a true adaptogen.
It increases

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:90%
your uptake of oxygen.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I've also heard
it's really good for hormonal

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.075 align:middle line:90%
balancing, and--

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:34.908 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, it's
excellent for hormones.

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's somewhat of a
subtle aphrodisiac as well.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It is?

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Maca, and so
is chocolate, right?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah,
and chocolate, too.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.262 align:middle line:84%
Chocolate and maca have
been eaten together

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.703 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK, what's another one?

00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:47.995 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Another one there
that you see in the images,

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:90%
goji berries.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And goji berries are
highly, highly regarded

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:90%
in Chinese medicine--

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
perhaps as the highest
member of that entire litany

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of pharmacologically
active herbs.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And goji berry is--

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
the reason why it's called
goji berries it's because it

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:90%
comes from a place called--

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
it was called Gagi, that was
like the way they pronounce it.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.060 align:middle line:84%
The Ningxia province in
that region of China,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as it spreads out
into the deserts of Mongolia

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and even up into the base
mountains of the Himalayas.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
This substance is
always at the center

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Chinese
herbal formulations

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
because according to, when
the Europeans went over

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.967 align:middle line:84%
there to categorize that
herbal system in the 1750s--

00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:84%
or I think was a
little bit later than

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that-- they asked the Shaolin
monks, where do we start?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this
is the plant you

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:84%
start with because this is
the one that teaches you

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:90%
about all the others.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the name, the
genus, in the Latin

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
binomial of goji
berry, which is Lyceum.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Lyceum comes from Plato's
school of learning.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Lyceum is a Greek
word for school.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.238 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So within
the goji berry,

00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
it is a complete source--

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's a
complete protein.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.735 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's a
complete protein,

00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:57.518 align:middle line:90%
meaning it has protein--

00:04:57.518 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It has all
the amino acids in it.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It has actually 18
amino acids and all

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the essential amino acids, which
is very unusual for a berry.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
It also is a very good source
of zeaxanthin, probably

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:90%
one of the best in the world.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what gives it its
orange and red pigment.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Zinc?

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.512 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: No, zeaxanthin.

00:05:14.512 --> 00:05:15.312 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:05:15.312 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: That's a carotenoid.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of carotenoids
in goji berries, which

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
are like beta carotene, and
this is for your eyesight.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So goji berry's one of the best
foods for eyesight and brain

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:90%
going.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And brain--
now, why brain?

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Brain as well.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, not only does it
contain the carotenoids,

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
which get into your
eyes and your brain,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:84%
but it also contains
sesquiterpenes which are--

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
they're molecules that are
like dialed one-and-a-half,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:90%
sesquiterpenes.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:90%
They're oils.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They're very
interesting oils that

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
help your brain secrete
human growth hormone.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the only food
known in the world that

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:84%
helps your body naturally
secrete more human growth

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:90%
hormone.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's amazing that
that all comes from nature.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just a perfect
balance in a single food.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: What's even more
amazing is that the Chinese

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.943 align:middle line:84%
discovered this 5,000
years ago and knew.

00:05:57.943 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't have any
of the analytical chemistry

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:10%
that we have now or scientific
analysis techniques,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.122 align:middle line:10%
but they were able to
figure this all out.

00:06:05.122 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's why we've seen
it hit the health food scene

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:90%
the recent decade.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yes.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like a sensation.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first came across
goji berries, I was like, whoa,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:90%
this tastes good.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Like, people eat this.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: People eat raisins.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:90%
They'll eat this--

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.965 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: --for sure.

00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:24.903 align:middle line:84%
But this has a whole herbal back
end that puts raisins to shame,

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:84%
especially the seedless
raisins we have.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So they're
slightly sweet.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But do they balance the blood
sugar levels or are they--

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.755 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Well,
they're slightly sweet.

00:06:32.755 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting, the
wild goji berries, about 50%

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.217 align:middle line:90%
of its sugars--

00:06:36.217 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
this is a whole other thing
that goji berry does--

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
50% of the sugars
of a wild goji berry

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
are long chain
polysaccharides, which means

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:90%
they're like aloe vera or noni.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
They have immunological
properties.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.277 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And that's
really interesting.

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the domesticated goji
berry, maybe it's about 36%

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
is these long chain
polysaccharides.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.362 align:middle line:84%
And these long chain sugars
are immunologically active.

00:07:00.362 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They also can get
into your joints.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:90%
They activate your brain.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
They're great for
long-term energy.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's what gives goji berry
really a big part of its magic.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So Jesse on Facebook is asking,
what are some of the superfoods

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that they can get at a
regular grocery store?

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Probably
turmeric comes to mind.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Turmeric?

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Turmeric.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's really a superfood.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:84%
My friends who work
on our farm in Hawaii,

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.560 align:middle line:90%
they live on turmeric.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
That's, like, one
of the main things.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Is that a root?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: It's a root.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It looks like ginger.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And it has a tremendous
amount of curcuminoids in it,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:84%
which is these really
deep orange pigments.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:90%
They'll stain everything.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the great
superfoods on the planet.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.388 align:middle line:84%
It's very powerful
anti-inflammatory,

00:07:40.388 --> 00:07:42.305 align:middle line:84%
probably the most powerful
anti-inflammatory--

00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.685 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: --you
can buy in a store.

00:07:43.685 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is that
also called turmeric?

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's actually
spelled T-U-R-M-E-R-I-C,

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.417 align:middle line:90%
not T-U-M-E-R-I-C.

00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, really?

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: So, it's turmeric.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.215 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's
always misspelled.

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's powdered.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: I've even seen people
who put out turmeric products,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and they have it misspelled
on their own label.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.035 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I think I have
one of those bottles.

00:08:00.035 --> 00:08:01.213 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] Exactly.

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: That
confuses everybody.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So name some
of the other superfoods.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So you'll
see there, raw cacao.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And chocolate is the
number one antioxidant

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
food in the world--
raw chocolate is.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.145 align:middle line:84%
And it's about--
actually before you

00:08:13.145 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
even-- when you just
cut it out of the fruit,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:84%
before you let it do anything,
before it sprouts, before it

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:90%
turns brown, it's purple.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.415 align:middle line:90%
In the purple state--

00:08:20.415 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Ooh, really?

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.415 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, that cacao
bean is actually about--

00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
can be as high as
13% antioxidants,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
by far the highest of
any food in the world.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Cacao?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yes.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Raw cacao.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And plus it has
magnesium, calcium.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's not
necessarily a calcium source,

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
but it's an excellent
magnesium source.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the
best in the world.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It's very high in
iron and manganese,

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:90%
the highest of any plant food.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.900 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinarily
rich in chromium.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's very good for
blood sugar balance.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.806 align:middle line:84%
And these are things that
we're going to get into later.

00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Yeah, we're going to
get into this in the secret

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:90%
energy elixir.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Another superfood.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Another one I'm
really into are the marine

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:90%
phytoplanktons.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.777 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we've
got an image of that.

00:08:58.777 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we've got the raw--

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Let's do these first--

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We can't
forget the bees.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: --and then we'll talk
about marine phytoplanktons.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:90%
The bees-- being a beekeeper--

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I became a beekeeper,
and I'm always

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:90%
learning more about beekeeping.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.047 align:middle line:10%
The bees are able to procure
from any environment, even

00:09:11.047 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:10%
an environment that would
be very difficult for us

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:10%
to survive in, like a desert--

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:10%
they're able to procure
protein for you.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:10%
They're able to procure glucose
and calories, basically,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:10%
from an environment where
it's very difficult to procure

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:10%
calories.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: How do they
procure protein, bees?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Well, they actually
collect it from pollens.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.527 align:middle line:84%
And pollens are usually
complete protein sources.

00:09:31.527 --> 00:09:32.735 align:middle line:90%
Like, the pollen of a flower?

00:09:32.735 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Now, it's hard to
actually eat enough flowers

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
to get that much protein,
but the bee does it for you.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll mix it
down into, for example,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:84%
royal jelly, which is
what they feed the queen.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
That extends the
queen's lifespan

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
from say three to six
weeks to seven years.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And that is an
incredible energy source.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's an incredible
source of B vitamins.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's easy to
remember, bee products

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:90%
contain B vitamins.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, that's perfect.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: That's easy
to remember, right?

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.135 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And those
are great for stress.

00:09:59.135 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Very important
for longevity and stress.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.037 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Lowering
cortisol levels.

00:10:02.037 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yes.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:90%
And liver.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin B5 is very
important for the liver.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And bee pollen is an
excellent source of that,

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.617 align:middle line:90%
but even better is royal jelly.

00:10:11.617 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: A good detoxifier then?

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yes, they
are detoxifiers, yes.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK, great.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And what I like
about the bee products, too,

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.012 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
your environment.

00:10:19.012 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:84%
They are a summation
of your environment.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.262 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And also, it's good to
eat local when you're in that

00:10:23.262 --> 00:10:25.152 align:middle line:84%
area of the bee products
that are around.

00:10:25.152 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: I usually
have my local honeys,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:90%
and then I have my exotic honey.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.603 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the
situation, you have

00:10:30.603 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
friends over, you're making
them a tea or something,

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put an
exotic honey in there.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But for the day to
day usage, I like

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to have my own honey
front my front yard.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.023 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: What's an exotic honey?

00:10:39.023 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: An exotic honey might
be a Pohutukawa honey from New

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Zealand, for example.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh, is there
a difference in taste?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And it could mean a
white honey from Canada.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.527 align:middle line:84%
It could mean a honey from
the jungles of Africa,

00:10:55.527 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:84%
which I have all this stuff
in my fridge-- every--

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all over the world.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So one of
our honeys here--

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.280 align:middle line:90%
one--

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: One of our honeys.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: --is asking, what if
you want to incorporate these

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:90%
superfoods into your family?

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it easily?

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
How do you incorporate
superfoods in your family?

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.223 align:middle line:90%
Family's, like, meal plan, diet.

00:11:14.223 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Probably the best
idea is don't tell them.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.778 align:middle line:84%
Just mix it into stuff,
and then later say,

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you what I've
been doing for the last three

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, so you mentioned
some of the higher protein

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.198 align:middle line:84%
index superfoods which are
the marine phytoplankton.

00:11:28.198 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, you
can look at that.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:90%
That's really great.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:10%
So marine-- the
original ecosystem

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:10%
of this Earth, way back
when, was basically algae,

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:10%
and it was freshwater
algae and saltwater algaes.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And there are all
different kinds still here.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:90%
There's like 40,000 still here.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.523 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The algae that we see
growing on the ground on rocks?

00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right, yeah.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
That you might see
washed up on a rock next

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:84%
to a creek or
something like that,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes you
see it in the ocean.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: One would not
think to go eat that.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.957 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, you
wouldn't think that.

00:11:54.957 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
But over the years,
the human race

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.840 align:middle line:84%
has figured out some
of them are edible.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:10%
Like, spirulina is coming out
of Lake Texcoco in Mexico,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.870 align:middle line:10%
for example, near
Mexico City has provided

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.195 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of thousands
of tons of spirulina

00:12:07.195 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:10%
for the people living there, and
has always been the number one

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.403 align:middle line:10%
protein source in the area for
the people living in that area.

00:12:12.403 --> 00:12:15.017 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: I wonder why it
develops as a protein.

00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's just the way
these ancient organisms are.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:84%
They're about 60%
to 70% protein,

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and they can contain a
high fraction of oils.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, some marine phytoplankton
can be as high as 30% oils

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and even contain DHA and
EPA, the same material that's

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%
in fish oil.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
vegan or vegetarian,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.970 align:middle line:84%
you want to go to that because
you can get the brain chemistry

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
oils that are in fish oil
without having to kill fish.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So these are the--

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:84%
let's see, we've got
marine phytoplankton,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the blue green
algae, the spirulina.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.655 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: These are common
ones that we hear about.

00:12:46.655 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Chlorella is also
a very good one.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: A very good one, right.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yes, very good.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: And we're
going to see that later.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.617 align:middle line:10%
>> WOLFE: We're going
to see that later.

00:12:52.617 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's really,
really pretty.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So Jamal, caller
from Brooklyn, what

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:84%
are some of the baby steps
of getting into herbalism

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:90%
on a limited budget?

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Well, it's a great
thing about herbalism is you

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.083 align:middle line:84%
just start with your
own neighborhood.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And you go out with a book or
you go out with a smartphone,

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and you just start
looking at things

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
identify certain things.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I think a great
way to do that is

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:84%
to find somebody who is
an herbalist in your area

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:84%
or a mycologist, somebody
who's a mushroom person

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:90%
and who does tours.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:90%
That's how I started.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And will take you out for
like two or three hours

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:90%
and show you different things.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.318 align:middle line:84%
And then you start realizing,
oh, OK, this is that.

00:13:25.318 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you can develop a
little bit of an interaction

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.405 align:middle line:84%
with your ecosystem,
which is always free.

00:13:29.405 --> 00:13:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's true.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: It's free.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's true.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:90%
You can go--

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Herbalism is the
cheapest way to live ever

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:90%
devised.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:84%
It actually is-- it's like
ancient humans weren't

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.302 align:middle line:90%
working all day.

00:13:39.302 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:90%
They weren't working all day.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
playing all day,

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they'd go forage for
food for maybe three or four

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:90%
hours, and that was totally fun.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But this
was their work,

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
was finding these foods in
their environment and sustaining

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:90%
their communities.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:90%
So back to the superfoods.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So we've got the bees, we've
got the marine phytoplanktons,

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
we've got the berries and
those types of things.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're all mineral-rich,
they're all plant-based,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're all various
sources of protein, which is

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:90%
why they're called superfoods.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I like superfoods being
plant-based because then it's

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.972 align:middle line:90%
for everybody, right?

00:14:12.972 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Because carnivores
will still eat plants,

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
but vegetarians or
vegans don't eat animals.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:90%
So we start there.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be inclusive.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the teachings--

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:84%
David Hawkins'
teachings about truth,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
is that whatever
truth is out there,

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:90%
it's got to be inclusive.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.438 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
fundamentals of truth.

00:14:30.438 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it's got
to work for everybody.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Everybody.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And the environment.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: And the environment.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're not designed to
really eat, like, just lettuce.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I like
lettuce, it's great.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.732 align:middle line:84%
But that's-- we're designed
to eat noble substances.

00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: To sustain us.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: To sustain us.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Like, if we had
the choice, why not

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
go after the most noble
substances in your ecosystem,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
whether that's like a ginseng
root, or a chaga mushroom,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:84%
or a reishi mushroom, or
it could be a goji berry,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:84%
or it could be wild
maca root or whatever,

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
your ecosystem is.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what you want.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
You want the most
powerful stuff.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Why settle for second-best?

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into a really
great demonstration of all

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:84%
of these things mixed into
one drink for ultimate energy.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.848 align:middle line:84%
And it will go a lot more into
detail on the superfoods then.

00:15:18.848 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let's
talk a little bit

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.040 align:middle line:90%
about the anti-aging process.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you're
a big longevity expert.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:90%
So what is that process?

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anti-aging, reversal
of aging, is it even possible?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: OK, well, I first
want to say that having been

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
in the health food
world for so long,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:84%
that I have felt surges
of energy and well-being

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and feelings of well-being
that have wanted to actually--

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
it caused me to want
to live, and I mean--

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I really want to
say that because--

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Somewhere,
subconsciously some of us may

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.720 align:middle line:90%
be checking out a little bit.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because our
bodies are in pain?

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.068 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Because the pain,
the stress, the whatever it is,

00:15:55.068 --> 00:15:57.423 align:middle line:84%
the emotional turmoil, and
so when you feel good all

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:84%
the time, you can actually get
into a state where you want

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:84%
to live fully and you get rid of
these subconscious death urges.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Because--

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Or something.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Absolutely.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.918 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:16:06.918 --> 00:16:09.243 align:middle line:84%
All the diseases that
manifest from the depression

00:16:09.243 --> 00:16:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety, that come
from the heart disease,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:84%
that come from the diabetes,
and so forth, and all the pain

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:90%
associated.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And so that's how
I got interested in longevity

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:90%
sciences.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.355 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading the old
books from the 1800s about some

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
of the documented
cases of people

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:84%
who had lived to be 105,
110, 120, 130, 137, 166.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Li-Ching Yuen, who apparently
lived over 200 years.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And at some point-- there was a
yogi who lived to be over 180.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, I realized,
OK, this is probably real.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not just some
kind of fantasy.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Because we saw it
in so many different texts?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah,
and it makes sense.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.458 align:middle line:84%
That there was a period of
time before the Industrial

00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Revolution where certain
herbal systems had become

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.255 align:middle line:84%
so advanced and so
sophisticated and understanding,

00:16:50.255 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and they were taught in
martial arts systems,

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
like in China, where it
was possible that somebody

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:90%
could live to be 200 years old.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And what were they doing
that was different?

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And then what we
learn from that?

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And what has science taught us?

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.448 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where I get
my perspective on longevity.

00:17:04.448 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's interesting we
were having a conversation

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
a little while ago about martial
arts and how the beginning

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
of a fight would be starting
with one specific set of herbs,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.095 align:middle line:84%
and the end of the fight
would be the more jing.

00:17:16.095 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Jing stuff.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:90%
We had that conversation.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It really has been used
in many different traditions

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:90%
A 5,000-year old system.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's just since
it's been written down.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: We're talking about
thousands of years of writing

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:90%
this stuff down.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure these systems
existed all over the place,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.147 align:middle line:90%
it just wasn't written down.

00:17:36.147 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So now, we're doing--
there's a lot of research

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:90%
on growing telomeres and--

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at that.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring
up an image here.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
We have here an image
of the chromosome.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's like an X
chromosome, or it could just

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
be any one of the
chromosomes that are in our--

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:90%
I think we have 23 pairs.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:10%
And at the end of
those chromosomes,

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:10%
let's just jump back
there-- you'll see

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:10%
that there's those red areas.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Those are damaged due
to genetic duplication

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
over the lifetime
of the cell line.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:90%
For example, muscle cells.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Every time they replicate
over your lifetime,

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:84%
there's a little bit of damage
to the end of the chromosome

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:90%
when it replicates.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't replicate perfectly.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:90%
There's a loss.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.266 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.643 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So that's
called a telomere,

00:18:18.643 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
that little end
that can be damaged,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.460 align:middle line:90%
that's the caps on your DNA.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
correlated to aging.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
With every little
bit that's lost,

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
there's a genetic age and
a certain predisposition

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:84%
towards disease, and frailty
that comes along with it.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So less
and less replicate,

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and they replicate
in a damaged way?

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.423 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right.

00:18:36.423 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And that's what the
loss of the telomeres causes.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Well, the loss-- yeah.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a feedback loop.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So as you lose telomeres,
it accelerates more rapidly.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So what the idea
that is there a way

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
we can either slow this
process down, stop it,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and/or reverse it.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
yes, yes, and yes.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And there's
been research documented?

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.552 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: There's-- yeah,
research on this now is

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
conclusive that you
can actually stop it,

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and you can even
genetically de-age yourself.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.723 align:middle line:84%
You can repair DNA damage,
or telomere damage.

00:19:03.723 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: This is
fairly recent research.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: This is
Nobel Prize research.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we have an image
here of these Nobel Prize

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:09.680 align:middle line:90%
scientists.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.805 align:middle line:90%
There they are right there.

00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:10%
The 2009 Nobel laureates
for basically breaking down

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:10%
this whole science of
telomeres and telomerase.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:10%
And what was figured out
from this kind of research

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:10%
was that there is a
substance that we know of,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:10%
that can actually
reverse genetic aging,

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.773 align:middle line:10%
which is an astragalus,
which is a super--

00:19:27.773 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:10%
or one of the top of herbs--

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: Back to the
Chinese medicine.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.388 align:middle line:10%
>> WOLFE: Back to
Chinese medicine.

00:19:31.388 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
That the Chinese actually
figured this out.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
They have actually figured
out that one of their herbs

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
has a property, in a certain
fraction of its nutrients,

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.590 align:middle line:84%
that can be concentrated,
that actually flips

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
your whole aging off, and
actually genetically de-ages

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: This is the research
that's been done about

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.040 align:middle line:90%
astragalus?

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: That's correct.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And in a
concentrated form.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Astragalus side 4.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have astragalus
side 4 concentrate over here.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We're going to talk a
little bit about that in just

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:90%
a second.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.070 align:middle line:84%
This is David's morning
ritual here, that he does.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk a little
bit about how he stays so young.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:90%
He's actually 89.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And-- [LAUGHS]

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: I'm doing
the best I can.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So the telomeres-- the
whole idea behind anti-aging

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and longevity is to
grow the telomeres,

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:90%
that's the specific part--

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: That is
a specific idea.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:90%
That's one strategy.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really darn good
one, and it's definitely

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:90%
something you want to consider.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, one of the
listeners is asking exactly--

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Kim on Facebook--
how many superfoods

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
do you recommend
consuming each day?

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Back to the superfoods question.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: OK.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.483 align:middle line:84%
How many is a tough
question to answer.

00:20:36.483 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess the better
question, or the better way

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
of me rephrasing that question--
it's a very good question--

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you start
with this stuff?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
you don't eat it

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:90%
in the way you ate normal food.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Goji berries are
extremely concentrated.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.992 align:middle line:84%
Marine phytoplankton is
extremely concentrated.

00:20:52.992 --> 00:20:54.825 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you don't
eat them like popcorn.

00:20:54.825 --> 00:20:55.625 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:57.023 align:middle line:90%
And I've done that.

00:20:57.023 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I was doing marine
phytoplankton--

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I was in Europe, and
we went to a place

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.392 align:middle line:84%
where they grow
marine phytoplankton.

00:21:01.392 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had chips of
it, like whole chunks.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.873 align:middle line:84%
And I was dipping it into
honey, and dipping that

00:21:06.873 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
into some chaga that I
had, and then eating it

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:90%
like a cracker or something.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.718 align:middle line:84%
About maybe 40 minutes
into it, my whole body

00:21:13.718 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
started heating up,
and I was like, oh, oh.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Wait, what's going on?

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.968 align:middle line:84%
I got a weird feeling
over my whole body.

00:21:17.968 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I was
super hot, like, burning up.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.462 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
whoa, whales, right?

00:21:24.462 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They're eating
marine phytoplankton

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.303 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean in a
freezing Arctic Ocean.

00:21:28.303 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: To stay warm.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And so what's
a food that warms you up?

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, marine
phytoplankton with its oils,

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and it has like
fish oil, basically.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.115 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:21:37.115 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to actually
go walking around outside.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I was in Denmark with shorts
on in the middle of November,

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:90%
just to burn off that.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Do not
try this at home.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So you've
got to start small.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.428 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us
are not-- our liver

00:21:49.428 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
is a little too toxic to really
deal with really rich food.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Our whole lives, we
ate that much food,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.880 align:middle line:90%
we got that many nutrients.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.635 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm saying, you
eat this much food,

00:21:58.635 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:90%
to get that many nutrients.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's exactly how
you live your life, right?

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You live your life
with various energy drinks,

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and various combinations
of these superfoods,

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.615 align:middle line:90%
and herbs in drinks and tonics.

00:22:11.615 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Mostly
in drinks, yeah.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: In superfoods--

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean in smoothies.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So Jane from Facebook is saying,
what do you do in the morning

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:90%
when you wake up?

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.535 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Well, first thing
I do is I drink water.

00:22:23.535 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So I get up in the
morning and I drink water.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:84%
In terms of an eating
ritual, I always drink water.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I do is I
usually don't eat anything ever

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:90%
in the morning, ever.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Nothing?

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So you wait for the
detoxification process

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:90%
to continue?

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, I drink a lot
of water and then I'll wait

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:90%
a while.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.447 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll get caught up in
emails, or iPhone, or whatever.

00:22:42.447 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Right, if that's how bad--

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's your meditation.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: It's gotten that bad.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Good job.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.485 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: I get
up and it's like,

00:22:47.485 --> 00:22:49.290 align:middle line:90%
what's going on my cell phone?

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.507 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:22:50.507 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: We didn't say he
was a meditation expert.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:90%
We said--

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.385 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: I don't meditate.

00:22:54.385 --> 00:22:55.248 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm into it.

00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's great for some
people, or for most people,

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:90%
but I know my mission.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:90%
I know what I'm here to do.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: What is that?

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: My mission is to
make superfoods, raw foods,

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
super herbs, living waters, and
advanced healing technologies

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:84%
of choice for every person
on the whole planet.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:90%
That's my mission.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's what
we're doing today.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And so
once you know that,

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.492 align:middle line:84%
and once you know what you're
about, what you're going to do,

00:23:14.492 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and how you're going
to do it, for me,

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:90%
my work is my meditation.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You are very
clear about that.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.620 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Very
focused about that.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Back to Jane's question.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: OK.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.822 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So what do you take
in the morning-- this is--

00:23:24.822 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So I will put this--
sometimes, I will take--

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:84%
like this morning, I got some
fresh organic local apple

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
juice, and I mixed all
this stuff in there.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I mixed the-- well,
let's start with TA65.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the astragalus
extract that

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:84%
was identified by the Chinese
as being a telomerase activator,

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
the very first ever
discovered that we know about,

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:90%
that's been told to us.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is an anti-aging
supplement, very powerful.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: The most researched.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's the
most researched.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It's proven to work.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And nothing else is
actually proven to work.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
This is proven to work,
meaning it genetically de-ages

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.020 align:middle line:84%
your cells, meaning
that if you take a test,

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and we check your telomeres,
if you do this product for two

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:84%
years, and then
we check it again,

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:84%
you'll be four years
younger genetically.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So double-blind,
randomized studies for how

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:90%
long?

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Years.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Two-and-a-half years I
think is the longest.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So now, this right
here is something I've been

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.048 align:middle line:90%
taking for a year, the TA65.

00:24:19.048 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I noticed after
about the first month is

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, oh, energy.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.887 align:middle line:84%
Like really primordial energy
like I had when I was 16.

00:24:26.887 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Did it take
time to build or?

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, I guess so.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:90%
It took about a month.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, I'm like wanting

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.385 align:middle line:84%
to go out running in
the middle of the night.

00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And stuff like that, which
I hadn't been-- had that

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:90%
going on in a long time.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The running
in the night, OK.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, or like,
oh, I need to go jog off

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.192 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night, and
just run to see what happens,

00:24:43.192 --> 00:24:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and getting it
back into running.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's great.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So you had a lot of energy,
energy production from this.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Now, this
is very expensive.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Ron Teeguarden,
who's a good friend of mine,

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and he knows about this product,
and he knows how to make it.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- as
we've talked about it

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.855 align:middle line:84%
before for a long
time, and I know

00:24:59.855 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
he's been working on
this for 20 years.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.855 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Ron,
now is the time.

00:25:02.855 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
You need to put
your thing together

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and we need to get it into a
lower price that's reasonable

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.820 align:middle line:90%
so that people can afford this.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he created
the Super Pill 2.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is taking
components of the TA65

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and mixing it more into
an herbal formulation that

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:84%
takes into account
the philosophy

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
of Chinese medicine-- the three
treasure system, the five organ

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:84%
system, the 12
meridians, yin and yang.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
Super Pill 2 is.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:90%
So I take these two together.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I do anywhere from
two of these each,

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.280 align:middle line:84%
like two Super
Pills and two TA65--

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: In the morning?

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.363 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: In the morning--

00:25:37.363 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:90%
or four of each.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: And then what is this?

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: This is reishi
mushrooms spore oil.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.248 align:middle line:84%
This is the most powerful
immunological product

00:25:43.248 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:90%
ever discovered in the world.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.608 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Immune system?

00:25:45.608 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, and so this--

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
listen to this statistic
that's on here.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:90%
This is something else.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Right here it says
this, "Reishi spore oil

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:58.443 align:middle line:84%
is estimated to be 700 times as
potent as raw reishi mushroom."

00:25:58.443 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh so the
oil itself is--

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Reishi mushroom is the
number one immunological herb

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:06.182 align:middle line:90%
This is 700 times more powerful.

00:26:06.182 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness,
and this is a capsule?

has contaminated us

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%

residues of pesticides

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.050 align:middle line:90%

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.160 align:middle line:90%
They're fake estrogens.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:84%

in our culture today,

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.400 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of

idea of energy.

00:30:39.677 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:84%
We could eat five
bananas at our desk,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and we'd get a lot of energy,
but it could crash really

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:84%
quickly, or it might be too much
for doing that kind of work.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is an idea that's
based on having the energy,

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
having the focus to be
able to be at our desk

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and be able to be in a car and
be able to run and do errands

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:90%

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:90%

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.430 align:middle line:84%
people still have never
seen this idea before.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
look at this idea.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:39.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a new idea.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:84%

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.168 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's really
exciting, actually.

00:31:42.168 --> 00:31:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's really valuable
if you live in a cold climate,

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:84%
especially, or in
the winter, even

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.280 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles in the
winter, because you

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.330 align:middle line:84%
can have a hot tea, as
a base for a super food,

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.610 align:middle line:90%
super herbal concoction.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So instead of the
old idea, which

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
is always a cold smoothie,
this is like a hot smoothie.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So this also gives you
that feeling of the warmth that

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe a coffee would give you,
or a coffee house feeling would

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:07.730 align:middle line:90%
give you.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Exactly.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:10%

different ways.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: This is
nourishing you completely.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing here
that's stimulating you.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: But it won't keep
you up until-- exactly.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Exactly.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So these are all what we
call tonic adaptogens.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:84%
These foods adapt
to what you need.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you need to get
to sleep at midnight,

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.600 align:middle line:90%
then you're asleep.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.083 align:middle line:90%
It's a breakthrough, really.

00:32:28.083 --> 00:32:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a breakthrough
in our understanding

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.098 align:middle line:84%
because our old idea was
like, in order to keep going,

00:32:32.098 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:90%
I have to use stimulants.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.280 align:middle line:84%
In order to keep going,
I have to use sugar.

In order to keep going, I
have to eat at 3 o'clock,

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:84%
energy that nourishes you
and feeds into your jing,

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:84%
for example, which is your
kidney adrenal complex,

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.487 align:middle line:84%
and actually build your
primordial life essence

00:32:49.487 --> 00:32:50.570 align:middle line:90%
the more that you do this.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And you're not
burning out your immune system

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:52.770 align:middle line:90%
in the meantime?

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: You're not
burning yourself out.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
feeding your adrenals.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.510 align:middle line:90%
You're feeding your immunity.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So how do the herbs to
balance themselves out and get

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.700 align:middle line:84%
you to sleep when
you want to sleep?

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:90%
How does that--

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Well, we can bring
it down to the chemistry,

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:84%
like over here, we have
astragalus and astragalus is

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.560 align:middle line:90%
dual directional.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's filled with what
we call saponins or soap,

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and what's also a soap?

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:84%
A soap, one part of the soap
molecule is water soluble,

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and the other side
is fat soluble.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.300 align:middle line:90%
So that's how soap works.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It can strip off the
oils off your body,

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, because
one side grabs the oil

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.330 align:middle line:90%
and strips it off.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Now in your body,
these saponins have

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:90%
dual directional qualities.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, if your
immune system is low,

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:90%
they'll bring it up.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:84%
If your immune system is too
high-- asthma, allergies,

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:90%
it brings it down.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And these herbs exist
in the rainforests and other

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Indigenous areas where--

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Where are they from?

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, we can go through that.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.453 align:middle line:84%
We'll do that as we
develop this drink.

00:33:46.453 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Yeah, it's just
interesting because you can

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.435 align:middle line:90%
find these herbs.

00:33:49.435 --> 00:33:50.810 align:middle line:84%
That's how
communities completely

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:84%
are sustainable and
live, way before us,

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and of course,
ancient civilizations

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.735 align:middle line:84%
have always existed on
these types of herbs.

00:33:56.735 --> 00:33:57.535 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right.

00:33:57.535 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So this is old
information brought to the new

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:90%
format, which is beautiful.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's my
favorite phrase actually.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Ancient old, brand new.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Beautiful.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Ancient old brand new.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Exactly.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:08.179 align:middle line:90%
Right, OK.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.304 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So here's what
we're going to start with.

00:34:10.304 --> 00:34:13.730 align:middle line:84%
In China, they had extensively
studied their herbs

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:15.810 align:middle line:84%
more than any other
culture in the world.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And they found that the
longest-lived people in China

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.239 align:middle line:84%
live in the south, in
a particular province

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:84%
in the south central
region of China

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:23.017 align:middle line:90%
where a certain herb grows.

00:34:23.017 --> 00:34:24.350 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know that back then.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They just found out these
people are living a long time.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's go find out
what's going on.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.409 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese Academy
of Sciences tracked it

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:33.320 align:middle line:84%
down to a particular
herb, which is gynostemma.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.469 align:middle line:84%
Gyno, G-Y-N-O,
stemma like a stem,

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's associated with
longevity and immunity.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And what they found out through
the Chinese Academy of Research

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Sciences that they were actually
dealing with an herb that

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.190 align:middle line:84%
was probably the most
chemically complex herb in all

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:90%
of Chinese medicine.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And they started ranking
it back in the day,

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe it came in at 100,
now it's number one.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one
Chinese herb of all.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Longevity herb?

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Longevity, immunity--

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Complete
tonic adaptogen.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So it helps you adapt
to whatever is going on.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It's really an amazing substance
and it has great flavor.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So the point of all
that is, is that's

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:84%
going to be the base
of our whole drink.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And that's
just the starting--

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.360 align:middle line:90%
that's just a starting point.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: That's just step one.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't have to
know-- the great thing

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.740 align:middle line:84%
about this is don't have to
know anything about any of this.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.448 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
just go, oh, I just

00:35:26.448 --> 00:35:27.640 align:middle line:90%
put that tea bag in there.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's beautiful.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.015 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Isn't that great?

00:35:30.015 --> 00:35:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So we've got some
hot water here.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So What I'm going
to do is I'm just going to get

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.100 align:middle line:90%
our tea bags out first.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.960 align:middle line:90%
So rip this open.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.543 align:middle line:84%
It normally comes
with a little thing,

00:35:36.543 --> 00:35:39.350 align:middle line:84%
but I had to pull that off,
because it won't hang on here.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
drop that in there.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's our Spring
Dragon Longevity Tea.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.140 align:middle line:90%
That's gynostemma tea.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's the tea right there.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The healthiest
tea on Earth.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.463 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It is the
healthiest tea on Earth.

00:35:48.463 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the hottest herb
in the world right now.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I actually think that gynostemma
can eclipse green tea.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's actually
caffeine-free also,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.175 align:middle line:90%
which is very interesting.

00:35:57.175 --> 00:35:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
other things in it, too.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:35:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Now these are gynostemma
leaves, that when they're dried,

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%
they're then soaked in the
juices of ginseng, rhodiola,

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
goji berry, and a
few other herbs.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.090 align:middle line:90%
And then they're dried again.

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So it adds a little
bit of a pizzazz to it.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's got a
superfood in there.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.540 align:middle line:90%
And a couple of things.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:19.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: OK, so we'll
just throw two in there.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:21.730 align:middle line:90%
We'll leave this one out.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So then we're
going to put our tea here.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.713 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be
like a hot elixir or a tea.

00:36:25.713 --> 00:36:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
put that in there.

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.010 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
it change color.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And I like to steep things.

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
leave it in there.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:84%

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.910 align:middle line:84%
that's a good thing to know,
is to not microwave your water.

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.290 align:middle line:90%

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.605 align:middle line:90%
This is a great start.

00:36:55.605 --> 00:36:57.730 align:middle line:84%
OK now, we're going to

It feeds your spleen.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.600 align:middle line:90%
It feeds your brain.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is being depleted.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:48.130 align:middle line:84%
It's all giving, and
we get the energy too.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea here.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's the most
important thing here.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.257 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's breaking
the pattern of what,

00:37:53.257 --> 00:37:55.090 align:middle line:84%
the addiction to the
caffeine and the sugar?

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Or just the addiction
to the idea that in order

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to get energy, I have
to have a stimulant.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.953 align:middle line:84%
In order to get energy,
you have to take sugar in.

00:38:00.953 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Just break that idea up.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:02.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So the first ingredient
is going to be

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:06.880 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorites,
ever, of all time,

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and I grow this particular
super fruit, which is lucuma,

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's egg fruit,
or canistel, and it

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.060 align:middle line:84%
comes from South America,
and the lucuma tree

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.010 align:middle line:84%
can live to be
over 500 years old.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have eaten
a lucuma fruit--

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: --from a tree
that was over 500 years old.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.592 align:middle line:90%
It's not a juicy fruit, though?

00:38:23.592 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: It's a really weird.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, they
call it egg fruit

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.125 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a hard
boiled egg consistency.

00:38:30.125 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Inside the--

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.292 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, you know the
yolk of a hard boiled egg?

00:38:33.292 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of
feathery and powdery?

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.130 align:middle line:90%
That's how this fruit is.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Comes out.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a juicy fruit.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It is not
a juicy fruit, no.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and they use it as
an emulsifier or a creamer,

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.890 align:middle line:90%
historically.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of takes
things that are sugary

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and mixes them with
things that are oily,

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:50.837 align:middle line:90%
and brings them together.

00:38:50.837 --> 00:38:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And it forms
kind of a cream?

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And it's
brilliant flavor,

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's a low
glycemic sweetener.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Essentially is why
we're using it.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.467 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to add the
flavor, but not the sugar hit.

00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you can also use
it for food, cooking foods?

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Absolutely.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.800 align:middle line:84%
You can use this
for salad dressings,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.050 align:middle line:84%
all different kinds of
foods, elixirs, smoothies,

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:09.500 align:middle line:90%
it goes every direction.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
put that in there.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:84%
That's like a heaping
tablespoon of lucuma.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Lucuma.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Lucuma.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a product
that I basically

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.150 align:middle line:90%
brought into the world.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a baby.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:90%
It's one of my babies.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:25.780 align:middle line:84%
This is chaga mycelium,
or chaga, C-H-A-GA.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
great medicinal mushrooms

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.600 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is a super
powerful jing substance

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.120 align:middle line:84%
in the Chinese
understanding, which

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.280 align:middle line:84%
means it feeds into
your kidneys, adrenals,

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.770 align:middle line:90%
it's really good for your skin.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: David was explaining
earlier the difference between

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Chi and jing.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Interesting
distinction.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: The three
treasure system.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So we've heard chi, it gets
thrown around the martial arts

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:90%
world a lot.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.980 align:middle line:84%
We've heard that our
whole lives probably.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But that's only one of the
energies in Chinese medicine.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Chi being the flow--

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And it's your
daily flow of energy.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the way you move
energy throughout the day.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the way that your immune
system mobilizes energy.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's chi, but
it's day-to-day.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it's like let's say
you're into martial arts,

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.340 align:middle line:84%
it's the first
round of the fight.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:06.330 align:middle line:90%
That's chi.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, jing is like the
15th round of the fight.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:14.100 align:middle line:90%
It's your primordial energy.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like Muhammad Ali versus
Joe Frazier in the 15th round.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.862 align:middle line:84%
That's your prime-- like,
it's your will to survive.

00:40:20.862 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Is it your
genetic energy?

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's your
genetic energy.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And you get it from
your grandparents.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.410 align:middle line:10%
>> WOLFE: So you get a certain
amount when you're born from

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:29.310 align:middle line:10%
your grandparents.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:29.700 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: Wow.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.620 align:middle line:10%
>> WOLFE: So if you had
healthy grandparents, like,

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:10%
if your grandma-- like my
grandmother lived to be 100.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, OK, that's good.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:36.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing, right?

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I have a couple of
100-year old ancestors as well.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: OK.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:40.990 align:middle line:90%
So see, that's good.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So that means that you
probably have potential

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.590 align:middle line:90%
for good amount of jing.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:45.775 align:middle line:84%
But you can build it
through your life.

00:40:45.775 --> 00:40:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
things that help.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, chaga mushroom
is one of them.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.278 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
put that in next.

00:40:50.278 --> 00:40:51.630 align:middle line:90%
This is immunological.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.100 align:middle line:90%
It's an immunological substance.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C is great, but if you
read Linus Pauling's books--

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.120 align:middle line:90%
which I did--

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.430 align:middle line:84%
it only helps about 3%
with the common cold.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:90%
3%.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Vitamin C?

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, that's nothing.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.760 align:middle line:90%
That's like not very much.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Oh, this is a great--

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: I'm talking--

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: By the way, great thing
to drink if you have a cold

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:08.160 align:middle line:90%
coming on.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:08.595 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Absolutely.

00:41:08.595 --> 00:41:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Very good to know.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And there's no sugar,
because sugar feeds infections.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right?

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: So important.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So important
to know that.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.147 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: All those C powders
out there that are mixed with

00:41:17.147 --> 00:41:19.650 align:middle line:84%
sugars will just deplete the
immune system while trying to--

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Do the right thing,

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:20.986 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:41:20.986 --> 00:41:21.130 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: And they're
trying to sneak in on taste.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.210 align:middle line:90%
We're just more clever now.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.140 align:middle line:10%
We've got more tools.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.880 align:middle line:10%
Like lucuma allows
you to get anything in

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.870 align:middle line:10%
and all tastes good.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:30.378 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: OK, so tablespoon
lucuma, chaga, powder.

00:41:30.378 --> 00:41:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It was a teaspoon,
basically heaping teaspoon

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.720 align:middle line:90%
of chaga powder.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:10%
That's C-H-A-G-A. So
the next one is maca.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:10%
And maca is a tonic
adaptogen, it's

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.830 align:middle line:10%
a superfood from the Andes.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.660 align:middle line:10%
It increases your
uptake of oxygen.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.780 align:middle line:10%
It's almost a complete protein
and it contains all the hormone

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.960 align:middle line:10%
precursors.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of preloads
all your glands.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So producing energy has a
lot to do with your hormones,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.160 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.810 align:middle line:10%
Like when you're 16, and
hormones are turning on,

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:55.920 align:middle line:10%
you have energy.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.298 align:middle line:90%
When you're 60, it's different.

00:41:57.298 --> 00:41:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: What about the
stress hormone, cortisol?

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:90%
What if that's raised?

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.485 align:middle line:84%
Is this a good
cortisol balancer?

00:42:02.485 --> 00:42:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Absolutely.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Maca is one of the
best, actually.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a tonic adaptogen. So that
means it's dual-directional.

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have
elevated cortisol.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:10.830 align:middle line:90%
It brings it down.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have
elevated estrogen, it's--

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.530 align:middle line:90%
maca is a cruciferous vegetable.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So it contains
indole-3-carbinol, and DIM,

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.830 align:middle line:84%
which have now been shown
to bring down bad estrogen.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Which is also a
cancer-fighting element.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Absolutely.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.662 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
products out I've

00:42:28.662 --> 00:42:30.060 align:middle line:84%
seen on the internet
that are now

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.180 align:middle line:84%
concentrating, like
indole-3-carbinol, or I3C

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and DIM, and mixing
it with maca so you

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.680 align:middle line:90%
get a higher fraction of that.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: But it's
in maca naturally

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
cruciferous vegetables.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest altitude
crop in the world.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.850 align:middle line:90%
We've got it as a powder here.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.180 align:middle line:10%
So that's going in.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.620 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about food, first.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Before we have to
go to bioidenticals,

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.150 align:middle line:84%
or whatever is beyond
food, let's try

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:53.010 align:middle line:84%
to work with food
first, and we've

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.963 align:middle line:84%
got the most powerful
foods in the world now.

00:42:54.963 --> 00:42:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It is amazing yeah.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's not
like apple anymore.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I love apples or grape.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:42:59.170 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing.

00:42:59.170 --> 00:42:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I love lettuce.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Lettuce is amazing, but this
is a whole order of magnitude

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.000 align:middle line:90%
greater.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yes.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: This is the, ah,
level way beyond that.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: OK, so this
next one is astragalus,

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the great
chi tonic herbs in Chinese

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.770 align:middle line:84%
medicine, and we just
put a teaspoon in here,

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:16.560 align:middle line:84%
it's just a small amount but
this is like pure energy.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It's vital life force and it's
a polysaccharide, versus just

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.060 align:middle line:90%
a saccharide.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.870 align:middle line:90%
A saccharide is like glucose.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.803 align:middle line:84%
So if you ate an apple, you're
getting a ton of glucose,

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get a kick
of energy, for sure, you

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.470 align:middle line:90%
can get stimulated.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.138 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: But you could crash
depending on your metabolism.

00:43:31.138 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Whereas this is
a polysaccharide,

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:84%
so it's a long chain
sugar, and therefore you

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:42.390 align:middle line:84%
burn it off slowly so that so
you don't get a spike from it.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That makes more sense.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.862 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that helps
maintain the glycemic index.

00:43:46.862 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: That's right.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.960 align:middle line:90%
It keeps you in balance.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So astragalus is one
of the preeminent chi

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.650 align:middle line:90%
herbs in Chinese medicine.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I've heard
it astragalus.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: In-- we've
got a spoon here.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: No smell.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: I was just
like, do we have a spoon?

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.708 align:middle line:90%
I just bumped right into it.

00:43:59.708 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get that all
the way out of there.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Every last little bit.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Every last little
bit, because these things are

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:05.250 align:middle line:90%
valuable.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: They're valuable, yeah.

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: When I have
these in my house,

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I get every last little bit
out because this stuff is--

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.200 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that we can
have access to these things.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Inexpensively as well.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And ashwagandha, which is
our next herb, is Indian.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:20.730 align:middle line:84%
It's from India, and it's one of
the preeminent tonic adaptogen

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:21.610 align:middle line:90%
herbs there.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.370 align:middle line:84%
What do I mean by
tonic adaptogen?

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can eat it as food.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Really?

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: It's a food.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You can just
dip your finger--

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's not an herb like
where you take too much and you

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.180 align:middle line:90%
have to lay off of it.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: You can--
it's a food category.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.353 align:middle line:90%
It's a food class.

00:44:35.353 --> 00:44:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: That's an interesting
actually topic right there.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That you can--

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.020 align:middle line:84%
there's a difference between
being hungry and having

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.970 align:middle line:90%
your cells being satiated.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.467 align:middle line:90%
There's a huge--

00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:48.300 align:middle line:84%
David was explaining
this a little bit to us

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:53.310 align:middle line:84%
beforehand about your
body's cells are--

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.180 align:middle line:90%
you're never hungry.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.305 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: I'm never hungry.

00:44:55.305 --> 00:44:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm overnourished cause I
eat these stuff all the time.

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So actually, most of the time,
I don't really eat meals.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one time of day, if
I'm in like, New York City,

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I'll go out to a raw food
restaurant with my friends,

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:06.580 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.705 align:middle line:84%
But then I get there, and
I'm like I'm not actually

00:45:08.705 --> 00:45:10.200 align:middle line:90%
even really hungry.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: I mean,
what do you eat?

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you get hungry, ever?

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Never.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:14.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm never hungry.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: You just eat these,
and these nourish your cells.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Your cells are fully satiated.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you
don't have cravings,

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.790 align:middle line:84%
you don't have highs and lows,
you don't have sugar cravings?

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: I don't--

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not hypoglycemic.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So if I don't eat, I
don't start getting

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:90%
this kind of thing going on.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.900 align:middle line:84%
This is very powerful--
actually what we're doing here,

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.150 align:middle line:84%
is we're getting a whole
classification, not only

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:84%
nutrients but also minerals
that we don't normally get,

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.520 align:middle line:84%
that help fight these kind
of blood sugar swings.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.497 align:middle line:90%
For example, manganese.

00:45:40.497 --> 00:45:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Manganese is present here.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Very difficult to get manganese
from your standard lettuce,

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.270 align:middle line:90%
banana, apple diet.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So what ends up
happening is if we're

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.422 align:middle line:84%
trying to get it
from food, we end up

00:45:49.422 --> 00:45:50.650 align:middle line:90%
becoming mineral deficient.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:52.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of-- let me
just clarify this.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of herbs and
superfoods are actually

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.180 align:middle line:84%
mineral supplements, is-- that's
what I'm trying to say here.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The hunger comes
from being mineral deficient?

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: The hunger pains,
the growling stomach?

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:05.735 align:middle line:10%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:05.735 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:10%
The whole hypoglycemia syndrome
is a mineral deficiency

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:10%
syndrome.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:12.300 align:middle line:10%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.842 align:middle line:10%
>> WOLFE: So our
body is going, look,

00:46:13.842 --> 00:46:15.390 align:middle line:10%
we need something right now.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.120 align:middle line:10%
If you eat seaweed, for example,
seaweed is so rich in minerals

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.340 align:middle line:10%
that after a year of
eating seaweed every day,

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.990 align:middle line:10%
you go out of
hypoglycemia, you're

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.160 align:middle line:10%
not hypoglycemic anymore.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Interesting.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Very important
to know about that.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: All right, so the
last one is-- my goodness,

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.910 align:middle line:90%
a lot of good stuff.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Vanilla, of course,
and that's just a small amount

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:33.420 align:middle line:90%
of vanilla.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Vanilla is so critical to
lock the whole formula down.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.217 align:middle line:84%
But if you do too much,
you're going to get like--

00:46:41.217 --> 00:46:43.050 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing is going
to go into vanilla,

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and you can do too much.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So we just put like
really a quarter, maybe

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.840 align:middle line:90%
a half of a teaspoon here.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.672 align:middle line:90%
Very small amount.

00:46:49.672 --> 00:46:50.880 align:middle line:90%
So, bam, that's in there now.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: All right.

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So we've
got ashwagandha,

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.157 align:middle line:84%
which is our tonic adaptogen,
that's just like astragalus,

00:46:55.157 --> 00:46:57.510 align:middle line:90%
actually but in India.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Ashwagandha was called in
India the ginseng of India.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It's like the preeminent root.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Right, that and
astragalus is the same thing

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.100 align:middle line:84%
to the Chinese medicine
community, right?

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.240 align:middle line:90%
As ashwagandha is--

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yes,
yes, very much so.

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So now, the reason
why we did it this way is

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.410 align:middle line:84%
because if I had
made a mistake--

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:19.410 align:middle line:84%
let's say I'm at home and
I have my vanilla bag,

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and am I going--

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.715 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
the whole bag

00:47:21.715 --> 00:47:25.260 align:middle line:84%
goes in, if I had put this
liquid in first, I'm done.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I just lost everything.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I do
the powders first.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It's just a way it's--

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.240 align:middle line:90%
a logic.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Beautiful
blend of powders.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, so now we've
got the powders in there.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, we could even
put fresh foods in here.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:42.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm into fresh foods, but to eat
a lot of fruit or even berries

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.970 align:middle line:84%

up, get everything done,

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.520 align:middle line:84%
get out the door, run your
errands, go pick up the kids,

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.883 align:middle line:90%
go pay the bills, go over there,

00:47:50.883 --> 00:47:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Make dinner--

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Drop the kids off at
Capoeira class or whatever has

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:90%
to happen, you know what I mean?

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:56.553 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Just explained my life.

00:47:56.553 --> 00:47:57.387 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

[CHUCKLING]

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: The fresh food is
going to hit and then crash

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:02.900 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Like it's going to be glycemic.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Our fruit is generally
too glycemic,

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.287 align:middle line:84%
whereas this is going to-- it's
going to power you through.

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:11.120 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be--

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you can even
pre-mix all this stuff,

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:84%
have it in your car, and
your cup, or whatever?

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:15.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:15.620 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Good to know.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:16.370 align:middle line:90%

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:17.990 align:middle line:90%
So now let's pour this in here.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how this goes.

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:20.612 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be kind of fun.

00:48:20.612 --> 00:48:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the teabag
doesn't go in there.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I know.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Let me--

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: You're going
to block it for me?

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.700 align:middle line:90%

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.500 align:middle line:90%

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: There you go.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: I'll just make
enough for both of us.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:29.775 align:middle line:90%
So we just pour it all in there.

00:48:29.775 --> 00:48:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: OK.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Make enough for everyone.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, this would
normally be two cups.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.815 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually about 3
cups that we just did here.

00:48:35.815 --> 00:48:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
lock the top on here.

questions right now that

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Frances on Twitter is saying,
I drink a lot of caffeine,

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.712 align:middle line:84%
will I feel energized
from this drink,

00:50:09.712 --> 00:50:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and how does she get off of
the caffeine, by the way.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Well,
the answer is yes,

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.590 align:middle line:84%
you'll get a lot of
energy from this drink,

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:16.450 align:middle line:84%
but it's totally a
different paradigm.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.590 align:middle line:90%
There's no stimulants.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:84%
When you do come off
a caffeine or coffee,

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.220 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have a low.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Right.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: So you have to
just get through that.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:24.093 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the
ingredients in here,

00:50:24.093 --> 00:50:26.290 align:middle line:84%
like the ashwagandha
and the astragalus

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.340 align:middle line:90%
are tonic adaptogens.

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.730 align:middle line:10%
So they help your liver
accommodate the withdrawal

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:32.440 align:middle line:10%
symptoms.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.690 align:middle line:10%
So it's actually going
to help you to get

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:36.120 align:middle line:10%
through the withdrawal process.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: That's a great answer.

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So the caffeine
from the coffee is

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:41.890 align:middle line:84%
more of a super high,
and then a crash,

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and then it might
prevent you from being

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:45.430 align:middle line:90%
able to get to sleep easily.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right.

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:46.593 align:middle line:90%
It's like an adrenal dump.

00:50:46.593 --> 00:50:48.372 align:middle line:84%
It causes your adrenal
to just fire off,

00:50:48.372 --> 00:50:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually,
there's like nothing

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.100 align:middle line:90%
left in the bank account.

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And that
taxes the adrenals.

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So this
sustains the adrenals.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: This actually
nourishes your adrenals,

00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:57.040 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.707 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that's
what we need more of.

00:50:58.707 --> 00:51:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: This is that just flip
around of the paradigm like,

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.410 align:middle line:84%
wait a second, this can give
me energy but it's not taking

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:05.210 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:06.430 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have any sugar.

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:07.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like amazing.

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:09.070 align:middle line:90%
It fits right in that--

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:84%
this is Chinese tonic

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it
has to have your--

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Stamp of approval.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yes.

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yes.

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:39.760 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I'm not into
selling commodities.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm sourced right to the
farm in every product.

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's not a commodity
on my website, ever.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So you hold a certain
level of integrity with

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:49.030 align:middle line:90%
the products.

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Absolutely, and you
can taste it and you can tell,

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.165 align:middle line:84%
and I invite people to
really try what's out there.

00:51:53.165 --> 00:51:55.198 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll be able
to discern quality.

00:51:55.198 --> 00:51:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So there's--
and then, also,

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.480 align:middle line:84%
your products are also sold
in health food stores as well.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: We're just
developing that, yeah.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: That's kind of fun.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I've had stuff in and out
of health food stores.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I like the internet better
because you can educate better,

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:07.000 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Like we're doing now,
we're able to touch you

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to
tune in to us and see

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.320 align:middle line:90%
what the stuff is about.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, people
to get-- they know.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And so then the health
food store makes sense,

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:90%
because it's close, it's easy.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.160 align:middle line:84%
You run down the road,
and you can just grab it.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Well, this is
also all about education.

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It's about how to--

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as David said, he
can sustain his entire day

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:27.430 align:middle line:84%
on these various types
of energy drinks.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So I would take these
products and I would put them

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.480 align:middle line:90%
in maybe like a little--

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.630 align:middle line:84%
like a bottle, and if
I'm going to pick up--

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:36.840 align:middle line:84%
carpool my daughter in the
middle of the afternoon,

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I would just make my
little tea in the car

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:40.310 align:middle line:84%
with some warm water,
and I would be set.

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, I do that
with a mason jar all the time.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You do?

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: Yeah, I'll
have a mason jar,

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'll throw a bunch
of ingredients in there.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, let's say
I'm out and about,

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.180 align:middle line:84%
let's say I'm able to
get some spring water,

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
I'll pour it in there.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Shake it up, drink it.

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.815 align:middle line:90%
So I do that a lot.

00:52:54.815 --> 00:52:56.690 align:middle line:84%
I travel around with a
mason jar quite a bit.

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It's very handy.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.213 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So it's an
on-the-go type of thing,

00:52:59.213 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:90%
which is very convenient.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the convenience
is where-- what got us here

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.070 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So I want to make sure
that people understand

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:07.960 align:middle line:84%
that you're
sustaining your body,

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.743 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
long-term solution.

00:53:09.743 --> 00:53:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: It's the
simplest thing, ever.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:12.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't ever have to--

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going through
drive-throughs ever.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Don't need to.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: It's all about--

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: It's all there.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: Yeah.

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Yeah.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: It's all about health,
it's all about getting out

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.960 align:middle line:84%
of the disease state and into
a state of vitality so that,

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.020 align:middle line:84%
you said so beautifully at the
beginning of this interview,

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.390 align:middle line:90%
that you want to live.

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: That's so important.

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I want to live, and I'm
trying to fit three lifetimes

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:33.175 align:middle line:90%
into this one.

00:53:33.175 --> 00:53:33.430 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: You mean?

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Right?

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like I'm
cramming it full.

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.480 align:middle line:90%
It's like, it's midnight, no.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm squeezing more
out of the day.

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
give up on the day,

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.772 align:middle line:84%
and I'll squeeze every bit of
juice out of every single day.

00:53:44.772 --> 00:53:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: I absolutely--

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WOLFE: That's so-- it's so
amazing to really live like

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:49.330 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Because that to me is like
what our ancestors always

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:54.280 align:middle line:90%
wanted for us, right?

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.110 align:middle line:84%
We're the descendants
of our ancestors

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and their wish was that
we could have a happy

00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.530 align:middle line:84%
life, that we could have a
healthy life, that we could

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:02.165 align:middle line:84%
live in paradise, that we could
have all the amazing gadgets

00:54:02.165 --> 00:54:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that we have today, that we
can have great relationships,

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.010 align:middle line:90%
great families, and we get that.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:09.263 align:middle line:90%
It's like, let's turn that on.

00:54:09.263 --> 00:54:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: So that's the bottom
line of what we're telling--

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.470 align:middle line:84%
on what we're talking about here
and what we're educating you

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.230 align:middle line:84%
about here at Gaiam TV
in "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.037 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to say thank you,
and thank you very, very much.

00:54:20.037 --> 00:54:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Thank you.

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:21.470 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: Thank you for all the
information you impart on this

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.440 align:middle line:90%
world, too.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.890 align:middle line:90%
You do so much for people.

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Thank you.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And did so much
for people listening

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:30.880 align:middle line:84%
because the responses
back has been great.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.280 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLING] So
thank you so much.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.120 align:middle line:90%
You've just been--

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Thank you so much.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LISA: --a rock star.

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: It's been wonderful.

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LISA: And thank you for the
good food and the good drinks,

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and we'll continue to spread
great cheer to people,

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.990 align:middle line:90%
especially during the season.

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> WOLFE: Thank you.

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle line:90%
