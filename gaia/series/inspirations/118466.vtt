00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaia Inspirations."

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And our topic here, at
the Celebrate Your Life

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Conference in
Phoenix, Arizona, is

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:90%
to explore the "I am" meaning.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to
the "I Am Discourses"

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:90%
through Dr. Wayne Dyer.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And, also, the word "I
am" shows up many times

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:90%
in "A Course in Miracles."

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And my guest today is spiritual
teacher, Marianne Williamson.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.035 align:middle line:84%
She's also a political
activist, an incredible mentor

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the course,
which she teaches also,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:90%
there's a beautiful phrase.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.802 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "I am the
light of the world."

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk
a little bit about that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.531 align:middle line:84%
and the meaning of
I am with Marianne.

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so
much for being here.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARIANNE WILLIAMSON: Well,
thank you for having me.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have been
a teacher of the course

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.864 align:middle line:90%
for many, many, many years.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: And a student.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:84%
A teacher is a student,
and a student is a teacher.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.402 align:middle line:84%
You wrote about it in "A
Return to Love", and you--

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: All
the books really.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a theme
throughout many of your books.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.637 align:middle line:84%
What does that phrase
mean to you, I am?

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:14.845 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, of
course, we all know the Bible.

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:84%
When Moses says, who
do I say that you are?

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
From a metaphysical
perspective, the idea

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
here is that the world tells
you that you are who, in fact,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:90%
you are not.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And the world-- the
thinking of the world

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:84%
tells you that you are
not who, in fact, you are.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
The world tells us
that we are bodies,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
that we are limited to our
own mortal circumstances.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
The world tells
me I am over here.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:90%
You are over there.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, that alone-- Einstein
said time and space

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:90%
are illusions of consciousness.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So the three
dimensional plane, which

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%
is what our physical
senses attach

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:84%
themselves to and then use as
evidence of ultimate reality,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:90%
is itself an illusion.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And it is a delusion in
that it reflects back to us

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
a reality that is not
the ultimate truth.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.719 align:middle line:84%
So it tells us that we're
separate from the rest

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I am separate from
the rest of life.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:90%
So when you say, I am love.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:90%
I am spirit.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:90%
I am the light of the world.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.890 align:middle line:84%
You are shifting
your self-perception

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.545 align:middle line:84%
from body identification
to spirit identification.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And "A Course in
Miracles" says that is

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:90%
the journey of enlightenment.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:90%
So when you realize I am body.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.440 align:middle line:84%
That's very different
than I am spirit.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I am my failures.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.121 align:middle line:90%
I am my mistakes.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:35.995 align:middle line:90%
I am other people's--

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sick, or whatever it is.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: --opinions of me.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I am my resume.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:90%
I am my past.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:84%
That is a very dense, weary,
and wearying perception of self.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But when you say I am whatever
I choose to be in this instance,

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
the past being over-- I am,
through the power of choice,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
capable of forgiving the past,
forgiving myself, forgiving

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
others, atoning for
my mistakes, standing

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
in the light of
the present moment.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Then, I am being who
I truly am, which

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:84%
is an infinite field of
possibility for a future

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:90%
unlike the past.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So who do you think
you are and also

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
what you think your purpose
is in a situation, which

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately, very much tied to
who you think you are, makes it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:84%
completely-- it is like
two different universes.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.785 align:middle line:90%
You're choosing.

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And we are choosing
every moment,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
either consciously
or unconsciously.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Do I wish to exist in a
personal universe of chaos

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and suffering?

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Or do I choose to live in a
personal universe of peace

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.800 align:middle line:90%
and harmony?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And that decision is
based on who I think I am

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and who I think
others are to me.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that I am can
really literally set you

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
in a totally
different direction.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.630 align:middle line:84%
That can set you in a
completely different direction

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
from going towards the sickness
and the disidentification

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
into identifying and moving--
literally moving forward

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.784 align:middle line:90%
into a different direction.

00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: It's
not just that it can.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:90%
It's that it does.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Every moment, the question
who am I, and why am I here?

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
If I think that I'm
here to-- I am here

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to get something from you,
takes me into one situation.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
I am here to be a
blessing on everyone

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
in the room takes you
into another situation.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just that it can.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:90%
It's that it does.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Every thought and every
moment, like I said,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
you are making that
choice, who you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:90%
think you are in every moment.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just sometimes
it's conscious,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and, sometimes,
it's unconscious.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a verse
that I took from the course

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and it also appears in
your "Return to Love,"

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and it says, "Holy
am I who have been

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
given the function of
lighting up the world.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.089 align:middle line:84%
Let me be still
before my holiness.

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:90%
And here's the best part.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And it is calm.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And in that light, all of
my conflicts disappear."

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:90%
That is so beautiful.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:90%
That is so rich.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.954 align:middle line:90%
That is so true.

00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And,
of course, that

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
mentions in that
beautiful section,

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
also, that that
is your function.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
When you are in-- you're aligned
with your true state of being,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:84%
you cannot but, be a positive
and loving influence,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
even a miraculous influence
on those around you

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:90%
because there's only one mind.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So when I am at one and aligned
with the truth of my being,

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
your-- the truth of
your being is activated.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's happening
right now, absolutely.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, as I'm sitting
here with you,

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I am matching the
vibration that you're at.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And it is elevating where
I was to where I'm going.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: "A
Course in Miracles"

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
says people hear you on the
level that you speak from.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you realize
that you are blessed,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.851 align:middle line:90%
you are a blessing.

00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I saw you speak at the
Parliament of World Religions.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, girl!

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:90%
You lit up that stage.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: A little
rambunctious that day.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.168 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you were here
with these incredible religious

00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:90%
leaders.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And you were here in a state
of talking about world religion

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:90%
as--

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: And women.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:90%
That was a women's plenary.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It was a
women's plenary.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I want to have you take a
look at this video real quick,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.050 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll talk about this.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: What an
extraordinary opportunity

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:84%
to have a world
parliament of religions,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
to have people
representing religions

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world
throughout our great tapestry

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
of history here in order to
not only support each other,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:84%
but to support the
common mission,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that common mission being to
live the lives that we are all

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
called to, at the core of the
universality of the themes

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:90%
that we all share.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think, also, we
have the opportunity,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
being here together, to
do the work of religion

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
religious principles

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.400 align:middle line:84%
is to purify your own heart and
atone for your own mistakes.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So as lovely as it is that at
this year's Parliament of World

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Religions, women's
voices are given

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
the power and the
privilege that we

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:84%
have at this great gathering,
as women let us just point out,

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.470 align:middle line:84%
not with anger or with rancor
that the history of religion

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:90%
has not been so good to women.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, in many of
the great institutionalized

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:84%
religions that are represented
even here at this parliament,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
they're not doing
so good even today.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a moment to atone
in our hearts, to be honest,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and be real because religion,
when it refuses to be honest

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and refuses to be real,
allows itself merely

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:84%
to be co-opted by the
very forces we are here

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:90%
to protect human beings from.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And that is why many of the
female voices rising today

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
in religious fervor, forming
a new vortex of priestesshood,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:84%
are finding ourselves,
at some times,

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
working within
religious institutions,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
at other times, not welcomed
in our true femaleness

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and practicing our
priestesshood elsewhere.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Every woman here who is
a healer is a priestess.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Every woman here who is
a teacher or an educator

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.623 align:middle line:90%
is a priestess.

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Every woman here who
feels in her heart

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
that she was sent by divine
mission, the same small voice

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
for God that not only leads
the great religious figures

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to perform their divine mission,
but which Mahatma Gandhi said

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:84%
was the leader of the Indian
Independence Movement.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:84%
No matter whether it's
political or religious

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:84%
or educational or business or
science or politics, whatever,

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:90%
we are here.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is the true
religious calling,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
to answer to that
small still voice

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:84%
within and lay it
down wherever we are.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the last thing that
would serve a world parliament

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
of religions and
the last thing that

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
would serve the women of
the world is for any of us

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to be too self
congratulatory at this time.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Every woman needs to understand
that having a meaningful life

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:90%
is not a popularity contest.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Every religion, every
religious leader, every woman

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
needs to understand if what
you're saying is always

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:84%
getting applause,
you're probably

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.445 align:middle line:90%
not yet doing the right stuff.

00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Because if we are to truly
stand for the reclamation

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
of the heart of
humanity, we must

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:84%
remember that we live today
on a planet that is not

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
organized according
to principles that

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:90%
reclaim the heart of humanity.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
World civilization today is
predicated on principles that

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.655 align:middle line:90%
break the heart of humanity.

00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.050 align:middle line:84%
World civilization
today is predicated

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:84%
on principles that
foster separation

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and not unity, that foster
greed over humanitarianism,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and that foster
devolution and destruction

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and decay of the Earth and
the living things upon it

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
more than the rebirth of the
possibilities divinely inspired

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
in all of us by which we might
become a human race at peace

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
with each other, with our
God, and with our planet.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
nonviolent resistance,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:84%
don't just concentrate
on the nonviolent part,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
also concentrate on
the resistance parts.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Let us remember the women on
the planet today who are raped,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
who are tortured, whose
children are killed,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
whose husbands are killed,
whose brothers are killed,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
who they themselves are
killed and, sometimes,

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:90%
yes, in the name of religion.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Let us not forget that.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And let us not forget that
to speak in real solidarity

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:84%
with such women-- I ask
myself, for instance,

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:84%
as an American woman, what if
every American woman had laid

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
down on the highways
across America and said,

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:90%
no, you will not invade Iraq?

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:84%
No, you will not do that
to the women of Iraq.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
No, you will not do
that to their children.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.925 align:middle line:84%
No, you will not
bomb their homes?

00:11:53.925 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I also know that to have
called for that at the time

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.860 align:middle line:84%
would have gotten
no real reaction.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:90%
But we, you, I, this is our job.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Let us create our societies
in whatever area we are.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
If you're an educator,
if you're a healer,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
if you're a religious leader,
if you are-- whatever you do,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
let us prepare the ground,
fertilize the soil,

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:84%
prepare the listening so that
as women do find their voices

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and men find their
voices, we must remember

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that passionate, free thinking
women have never been deeply

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
appreciated by the great
religions of the world

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:84%
because passionate,
free thinking women

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
raise passionate, free
thinking children.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And passionate, free
thinking children

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.940 align:middle line:84%
grow up to be passionate,
free thinking adults.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And passionate,
free thinking adults

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:84%
are very difficult to
manipulate and almost

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:90%
impossible to control.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I read the
comments after that.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.939 align:middle line:84%
How many millions of
views have there been?

00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: A couple million.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A couple million.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: More
than 2 million.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because
you got up there,

00:13:23.815 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:90%
and you stood in your right.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:30.002 align:middle line:84%
And it was about being-- about
world religion not working.

00:13:30.002 --> 00:13:31.085 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Like, hello!

00:13:31.085 --> 00:13:33.126 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're the Conference
of World Religions,

00:13:33.126 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:90%
and this is not working.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Where did that come
from inside of you?

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Did you plan that?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, I--
for 30 years, I planned it.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I am aware that people,
such as yourself and myself,

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:84%
so many of our colleagues, so
many people around the world,

00:13:55.030 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
in both secular and
religious constant-- context

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
are doing what we can to
bring down the light of love

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:90%
and possibility.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And as I say in that
talk, that is a kind

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:90%
of new priestesshood to me.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Every woman who is an
activist is a priestess.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.604 align:middle line:84%
Every woman who is an
author is a priestess.

00:14:17.604 --> 00:14:19.311 align:middle line:84%
Every woman who is
doing the kind of work

00:14:19.311 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing in the
media is a priestess.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.021 align:middle line:84%
Every woman who is a
mother is a priestess.

00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:23.987 align:middle line:90%
A wife is a priestess.

00:14:23.987 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.278 align:middle line:84%
That means you're
holding the space

00:14:26.278 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and invoking the possibility
in much the way you and I were

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, organized religion has
this grandiosity around itself,

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and it acts as though
it's doing that.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.920 align:middle line:90%
But I question it.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I challenge
the belief that it's

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.780 align:middle line:84%
doing that anymore or
any less than any of us

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:84%
are who are seeking
to live according

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:84%
to that small,
still voice within.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm intrigued by the Quakers.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm intrigued by
that notion that they

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:84%
have of the inner light--
that universal inner light

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:84%
within every man,
woman, or child that

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
creates a profound equality,
that the spirit of God

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
is in all of us know more
and no less than anyone else.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent to
which any one of us

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:84%
listens to that
small, still voice

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and lives from that small,
still voice, to that extent,

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
we are all providing a
ministerial function.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.316 align:middle line:84%
We are all providing
a priestly function.

00:15:19.316 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Talk about
that, the priestess.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I've seen you talking
about that lately.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, when
I-- in that video that you

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
were showing, it
was specifically

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.652 align:middle line:84%
in the context of talking
to religious leaders.

00:15:29.652 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So they we're making a
big hoopla over the fact

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
that at this year's
Parliament of World Religions

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:90%
women had such a voice.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.924 align:middle line:84%
And women were--
well, let's be real,

00:15:37.924 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the reason women have such
a voice is because women,

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.548 align:middle line:84%
as usual, we're
doing all the work.

00:15:41.548 --> 00:15:42.487 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, come on!

00:15:42.487 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And haven't had a voice.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Yeah, thank you.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.195 align:middle line:84%
So I just thought I would
mention that it's fine

00:15:47.195 --> 00:15:49.236 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing this in
Salt Lake City in 2015,

00:15:49.236 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:84%
but the last few thousand
years have not really

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:90%
gone that well for us.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, you
were very clear.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Just
a little mention.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The elephant
in the room.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.785 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: But I think that
the important part for me,

00:15:58.785 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:84%
in all seriousness,
was we have gone on.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- I remember when
I first started my career.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would call
me and say, your father

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:90%
and I have discussed it.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to go
to rabbinical school,

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.050 align:middle line:84%
we'll send you to
rabbinical school.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
can't just get up

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and start talking about God.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And, at that time,
those-- it did

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
seem as though there
were two choices.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:84%
You could be an academic,
like a professor

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
of comparative religion
or something, or clergy.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:90%
And neither felt correct to me.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.680 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to talk about God.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk about
the course in miracles.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
There was no
institutional surrounding.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I've
experienced is that when

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
you're content is-- all you want
to do is be ablaze with God,

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:90%
then form emerges organically.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So the thinking of the
world says, no, you

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:84%
have to look through
the world of form

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:90%
and see where you might fit in.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I spoke at Harvard Divinity
School a couple of weeks

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:90%
ago as well.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting to me how
many of the students at Harvard

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Divinity School-- they're
in Divinity School,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
necessarily see themselves

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:90%
having congregations.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are dealing
with, where do I go with this?

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:84%
From a metaphysical perspective,
you align with your being

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:84%
first, and the doing
will take care of itself

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
because you will be
intuitively guided

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:90%
and also the forms will appear.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So my message with the
Parliament of World Religions

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is that institutional
religions are just one context

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:90%
for the genuine religious life.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And they are only one context
for genuine religious fervor.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And they are only one
context for genuine religious

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:90%
bringing it down.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You could call it priestly
function, priestess.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.109 align:middle line:84%
The course in miracles says, "I
am among the ministers of God--

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
is one of the lessons
in the course--

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.432 align:middle line:90%
that we are all ministers.

00:17:52.432 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You are ministering
through this program.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.556 align:middle line:84%
You're ministering through
that great book that you write.

00:17:56.556 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:90%
You are ministering as a wife.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:90%
You're ministry as a mother.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:90%
We are all here.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:84%
That is a function
all of us have,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:90%
no matter what our job is.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:84%
If we see its purpose
as to use our talents

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and use our resources
to minister unto life,

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:84%
to bring greater life, to
bring greater blessing,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
to bring greater healing,
then you are doing that work.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And no institution gets to
claim that work for its own,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
particularly given
its track record

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.084 align:middle line:84%
over the last few
thousand years.

00:18:24.084 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you have-- we have
a clip of that Harvard Divinity

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:84%
We have you speaking to that
congregation, essentially

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:90%
is what it was.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: We are displaying,
as a species, behavior--

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
collective behavioral
patterns that

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.799 align:middle line:84%
are maladaptive for the survival
of our species, quite simply.

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We are the only species known
to systematically destroy

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:90%
its own habitat.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And we simplify fight too much.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
There are-- one gentleman
argued earlier today

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.851 align:middle line:90%
that-- he said the wolverines.

00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But maybe he's right
about the wolverines.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But other than that we
are the only species that

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:90%
exhibits gratuitous cruelty.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And we fight each
other too much,

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and we are fighting
each other now

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
with weapons, responsible use
of which, if you could even

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
say that there's such a thing
as responsible use of which,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is so far from our
actual practices

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that the stress point on
the planet-- I remember,

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
years ago, I went to--
I think it's Wyoming.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Forgive me.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.435 align:middle line:84%
I get dyslexic about
Wyoming and Idaho.

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
One of them had huge
fires in the 1980s.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And this horrible conflagration
that occurred in that state

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:84%
at that time actually
changed the calculus

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:90%
of professional firefighting.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Because what-- before
that time, there

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
is a concept in
professional firefighting

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:90%
called the acceptable burn.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I live in California, so
we know, unfortunately,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.337 align:middle line:84%
a lot about fire, so
right now, once again

00:19:56.337 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
exacerbated by the draught,
once again exacerbated

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:90%
by climate change, and so forth.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Acceptable burn means
where they do a calculus,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and they say, OK, our best
way to deal with this one

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:90%
is to let it burn.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
What happened that
particular summer,

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
in either Idaho or Wyoming--
I'm going to get things

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:90%
on Facebook and Twitter.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:90%
It was Idaho.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It was Wyoming,
whatever-- in one of them.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Wyoming--
was that there were

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:84%
too many otherwise considered
acceptable burns too

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:84%
close together happening
at the same time.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what made
the whole thing blow up.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:84%
That is what is happening
on the planet today.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You could talk about
climate change.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.374 align:middle line:90%
You could talk about terrorism.

00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You could talk about
economic injustice.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:84%
You could talk
about so many things

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
through in this country.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.366 align:middle line:84%
And you could talk about
so many things are going on

00:20:44.366 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
in the planet, and say,
we can handle this.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
The body-- neither the body
nor civilization nor the psyche

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
evolved over thousands and, in
some cases, millions of years

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
without developing a
system within itself that

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:90%
enabled it to take a hit.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And American democracy has
taken some hits, but there

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
comes a time, if the
body takes too many hits,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
then-- I remember hearing
President Clinton talking

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:90%
about assault weapons.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And hearing him talk about
emergency room doctors saying

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
to him, if somebody comes in,
and there's a gunshot wound,

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of cases, we have
a good chance of saving him.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It's when it has been
an assault weapon

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and there are ten gunshot wounds
where we don't have a chance.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Are you with me?

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
on the planet today

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
is a whole systems breakdown
that we've got on our hands.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a whole
system's response.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
someone like-- if you

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:84%
look at a phenomenon
like the Nazis,

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
look at the Japanese
Imperial army,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.730 align:middle line:84%
World War II
represented a cancer,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:90%
but it was an operable cancer.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:84%
It was a cancer which could
be surgically removed.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was brilliantly,
surgically removed.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have a cancer, which
has metastasized broadly,

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
is wrapped around many healthy--
otherwise healthy organs,

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
invasive measures even
when they have been tried.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.109 align:middle line:84%
We can argue whether
the invasion of Iraq

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:26.150 align:middle line:84%
could have or should have
ever been seen as that.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But even to whatever
extent it was,

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.495 align:middle line:84%
giving George Bush
and Dick Cheney

00:22:30.495 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
a way benefit of the
doubt, clearly did a little

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:90%
more than spread the cancer.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.081 align:middle line:84%
So we now need a
holistic perspective.

00:22:39.081 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's so
interesting that you

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.740 align:middle line:84%
say about the difference
between the congregation

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and the people speaking
about world religions

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and where they're
going to go with this.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's such
a difference now

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
were you don't necessarily
need to be a scholar, even

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.476 align:middle line:84%
though it's wonderful to learn
about the ancient religions

00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:90%
in the text and world religions.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
But you can come out and talk
as a person of authority,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
as you have, about God,
about world religions,

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:84%
about the Bible, and
not necessarily have

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:84%
to be a scholar of the
organized religion.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
That gives-- that
right right there,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
what you're talking about,
is you bringing your light.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You shinning your light
brighter than it ever had to be,

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:84%
just shining that
light so bright.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And you speaking there,
you're an example

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:90%
of that to many people.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I said in the
beginning, I am light.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
That is what you're doing is
you're being a light for God,

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:90%
for religion.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: There's an
interesting issue there,

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:90%
however.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot
of the criticism that

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:84%
is waged against much of
our consciousness movement

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
does have legitimacy
in that there are--

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:84%
there do seem to be
people these days

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:84%
who attend a seminar or
two and set themselves up

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.670 align:middle line:90%
as spiritual teachers.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:90%
That's not cool.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And the criticism wage
that, oh, you guys are just

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
coming up with ideas of your own
and standing up and saying this

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:90%
is God's truth.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:84%
That is not what
I'm talking about.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm a student of a
course in miracles,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm someone who
is read for years

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and practiced it for years.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So when someone gives a, quote
unquote, "spiritual moniker"

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:84%
to their work, they
should have some basis

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
in a serious spiritual
text of some kind.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.080 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.163 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to call
it a motivational speaker,

00:24:28.163 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
strictly motivational speaker
or life coach or something,

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:33.830 align:middle line:84%
then, yes, there's a
ministerial function

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
people believing

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.144 align:middle line:84%
in themselves,
with people knowing

00:24:37.144 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:90%
that there's a higher power.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:90%
You look at something like AA.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:43.760 align:middle line:84%
They talk about a higher power,
God as you understand him.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
once you recognize

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:84%
that the world is in such
trouble and that all of us

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
must see ourselves now
and can see ourselves

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and can act as
immune cells-- we're

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:00.430 align:middle line:84%
all here to be part
of the immune cells,

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:90%
the healing of the body.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Then, the point is not
the word, but the energy

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that we bring to the
experience by which we

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:90%
surrender ourselves every day.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:84%
The course in miracles says that
you can wake up every morning

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and say the prayer,
where would you

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:84%
have me go, what would you
have me do, what would you

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:90%
have me say, and to whom?

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you surrender, and
you say, dear God, use me.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very helpful
to remind ourselves--

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.655 align:middle line:84%
and I say to people
all the time.

00:25:28.655 --> 00:25:29.530 align:middle line:90%
You're not the water.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:90%
You're the faucet.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're going
to go heal the world,

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.330 align:middle line:84%
but you can
surrender yourself so

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
that a power greater than
you uses you as a conduit,

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
uses your hands, uses your
feet, puts ideas in your mind,

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
puts inspiration, puts
love in your heart.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I always
feel, in my own life,

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that 90%-- any problem
I have, 90% of the time,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I find a solution more easily
if I remember this one thing.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Marianne, get over yourself.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not about you.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And that goes back to I am.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I am not this separate
self who's just about me,

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:90%
me, me, me, me.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mhm.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I was reading a quote this
morning by Viktor Frankl.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.248 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Uh huh.

00:26:16.248 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Wow, he's--

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.231 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it really,
really was profound.

00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:90%
And it was along those lines.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said you can take
anything away from a man.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.479 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot take
away his attitude.

00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, of course,
he was speaking as a Holocaust

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:90%
survivor who had been through--

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Suffering.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.923 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: The most heinous--

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tremendous, tremendous,
tremendous suffering.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And what he had, the one
freedom that he said he had left

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:90%
was his attitude--

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.435 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: What
he chose to think.

00:26:41.435 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and his ability
to control his attitude.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: No
one can make you.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was so important to me
because you could take anything

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.057 align:middle line:84%
away except our ability
to control our attitude.

00:26:51.057 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: You know I was
reading about Viktor Frankl

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.890 align:middle line:90%
once.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember-- when
the Holocaust was over,

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember if he
took one year or two years

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and remained in
complete silence,

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:84%
said he was going to
remain in complete silence

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and then would spend the
rest of his life speaking

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.875 align:middle line:84%
for the victims
of the Holocaust.

00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I thought
that was so profound.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That would
makes sense because of--

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.491 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: I can't remember.

00:27:17.491 --> 00:27:19.157 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --he had
to digest it all.

00:27:19.157 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Unspeakable.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you were
talking to me earlier

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
about your next book that's
coming out about suffering

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.205 align:middle line:84%
and depression, can
we talk about what

00:27:27.205 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:90%
your suggestions are?

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.038 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Oh, Lisa.

00:27:29.038 --> 00:27:31.170 align:middle line:84%
This is such a huge issue
and such a huge issue

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:90%
in our society at this moment.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.370 align:middle line:84%
The role of religion-- going
back to the role of religion,

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:84%
religion used to play
the role of comforter.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
It comforted people through
the experiences of life

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:90%
by giving it meaning.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:84%
It inspired people, and
it comforted people.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, it has abdicated the role.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And it abdicated the
role to psychotherapy.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And psychotherapy was not
a traditional-- western

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy was
not able to provide

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.970 align:middle line:84%
an ultimate context of meaning
because, except in the cases

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
of those such as Carl Jung, it
doesn't dwell within a world

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:90%
view of ultimate meaning.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So over the last few years,
it has abdicated the role

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:90%
to psychopharmacology.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And what we have now is
a crisis in our country.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
People are taking
anti-depressants like candy.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.620 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing when you talk
about the very, I think,

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:84%
valid-- I believe, very
legitimate conversation

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:84%
around psychotherapeutic
drugs for a bipolar diagnosis,

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
a diagnosis of
schizophrenia, and so forth.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:38.950 align:middle line:84%
However, these psychotherapeutic
and psychopharmacological

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
industries now-- because
we are talking about--

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Very huge.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON:
--billions of dollars

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:84%
being made off this-- have
now absconded with the word

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:90%
depression.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.286 align:middle line:90%
So if I say I'm sad.

00:28:47.286 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:90%
You say you're sorry.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:84%
If I say, I'm really
depressed, there

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:84%
is this like
automatic assumption,

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:84%
well, perhaps you
need medication.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And no one is questioning this.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
They so, oh, well
clinical diagnosis.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Clinical diagnose-- we have
this witch doctor thing.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Clinical diagnosis.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the truth of the matter
is, in many ways, obscured.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the
matter, for instance,

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:84%
people who are 25 and younger,
for people who are 25 years old

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and younger, anti-depressants
actually increase suicide risk.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're throwing
anti-depressants

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:22.680 align:middle line:90%
at all young people.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.277 align:middle line:84%
We are not-- we
don't have any kind

00:29:26.277 --> 00:29:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of truly sophisticated--
and certainly

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:84%
not from a spiritual
perspective-- view

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.795 align:middle line:90%
of what sadness is.

00:29:31.795 --> 00:29:32.920 align:middle line:90%
And that it's part of life.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:84%
We have this cheap yellow
smiley face that we just

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:90%
pour on everything these days.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Happy, happy, happy.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Just like the body
has an immune system.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Grief is part of our
psychic immune system.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.840 align:middle line:84%
If you go through
a car accident,

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.075 align:middle line:84%
and you're very
bruised and beaten up--

00:29:50.075 --> 00:29:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Trauma.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: --it's
understood your body is going

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.624 align:middle line:90%
to need some time to heal.

00:29:54.624 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you go through
a psychological trauma

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.040 align:middle line:84%
or emotional trauma, we need to
understand it's understandable.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need
some time to heal.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.300 align:middle line:90%
That's not a mental illness.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Sadness is not a mental illness.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Grief is not a mental illness.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's become a meme
that permeates our society as--

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.678 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And it's
very terrible now.

00:30:12.678 --> 00:30:16.942 align:middle line:84%
You have just this epidemic
of the people taking

00:30:16.942 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:84%
antidepressants
like they're candy,

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.610 align:middle line:90%
as though it's no big deal.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And what kills me,
in our community,

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:84%
is all these people
who say, oh, I

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.833 align:middle line:90%
don't want chemicals in my food.

00:30:23.833 --> 00:30:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want
chemicals in my food.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But for-- because I don't
want chemicals in my body.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Why do you not want
chemicals in your body,

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:84%
but you are so open to
chemicals in your brain?

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that's part
of the meme of society.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.445 align:middle line:90%
We have the advertisements.

00:30:35.445 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: It's
part of the meme.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And Abilify, which
is the single largest selling

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:84%
prescription drug
in America today

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:90%
is an anti-psychotic drug.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:90%
It's an anti-psychotic drug.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.222 align:middle line:84%
And, Lisa, this is not the
time in America to be numb.

00:30:52.222 --> 00:30:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it goes back--
let me go back to the religion

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.630 align:middle line:84%
conversation here
because, do you think,

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and especially that generation
you're talking about,

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is missing meaning, community,
society because of the fact

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.180 align:middle line:84%
there isn't-- what organized
religion did provide,

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:90%
provided that.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It provided gatherings--
group gatherings.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:13.255 align:middle line:90%
It was a commonality.

00:31:13.255 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:90%
It was a greater purpose.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That there's a higher
divinity above--

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:84%
not above you, but in play here,
that there's something larger

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:90%
than life.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Above the main
thought forms that dominate.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:22.935 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Rights

00:31:22.935 --> 00:31:25.476 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: It's within you,
but it's higher thought forms.

00:31:25.476 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is our
youth missing that?

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well, the--
if you actually look-- let's

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.950 align:middle line:84%
say Buddhism and Judaism
and Christianity,

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.175 align:middle line:84%
suffering is central
to all of them.

00:31:37.175 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, had Buddhism
not left his father's house

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and seen age and suffering and
disease for the first time,

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:84%
he would not have begun
his path to enlightenment.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.610 align:middle line:84%
His ultimate realization
was that life is suffering.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:84%
His ultimate realization was
that attachment to the things

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:90%
of the world is suffering.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And the only escape from
this is through enlightenment

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.170 align:middle line:84%
or being lifted and rising
above these attachments.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
In Judaism, in
the Old Testament,

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the suffering of the
Israelites, when they were

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.720 align:middle line:84%
slaves in Egypt, the
suffering of the Israelites

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.250 align:middle line:84%
in their journey through
the desert on their way

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:90%
to the promised land.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.005 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
suffering of Jesus on the

00:32:16.005 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:90%
cross in Christianity.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like, quote,
"religions" do not

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.595 align:middle line:90%
have this gold.

00:32:24.595 --> 00:32:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's that they do not spend
their time, for the most part,

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:84%
delivering this gold or
at least not delivering it

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is truly
speaking to people

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of their
personal suffering.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.490 align:middle line:84%
When you get to that
point-- I always

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:84%
say you never meet
a Jew who says

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go
to Passover seder

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.700 align:middle line:84%
this year because
I know the story.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going-- you don't
meet a Jew-- a Christian who

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:84%
says I'm not going to
go to Easter services

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:84%
this year because
I know the story.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.459 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:52.459 --> 00:32:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand the
metaphysical context

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:01.940 align:middle line:84%
for all this, you realize the
story doesn't change, but I do.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:90%
I come to see, oh, I get it.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Slavery in Egypt,
that was my divorce.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:07.170 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Crucifixion, that was
my cancer diagnosis.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I get it.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Wandering through the desert,
that was my bankruptcy.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you do have
a way of connecting,

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.840 align:middle line:84%
then the beauty
of these things is

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.639 align:middle line:84%
that you realize the slavery
in Egypt and the wandering

00:33:23.639 --> 00:33:25.180 align:middle line:84%
through the promised
land-- wandering

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.700 align:middle line:84%
through the desert, preceded
entering the promised land.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.140 align:middle line:84%
The crucifixion precedes
the resurrection.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.250 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
through God's promises,

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:90%
this will one day be over.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.430 align:middle line:90%
This too shall pass.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And as my mind is lifted
to the genuine level

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.910 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment--
Moses, Buddha, Jesus--

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:84%
you actually are lifted to
that place where you endure

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:90%
the suffering of the desert.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.245 align:middle line:84%
You endure the suffering of
your personal crucifixion.

00:33:56.245 --> 00:33:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But You rise through
that alchemy,

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:84%
which is the
genuine fire of God,

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:84%
to that place where,
yeah, I went through that.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Things have come around.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:07.790 align:middle line:90%
I learned a lot.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually a better, smarter
person than I was before.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And as it says in the Bible and
in the "Course in Miracles,"

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.397 align:middle line:84%
God himself has
wiped away all tears.

00:34:16.397 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Beautifully,
beautifully said.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:84%
It brings us full
circle to what we

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:21.765 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
earlier with the I am

00:34:21.765 --> 00:34:24.219 align:middle line:90%
and being ingrained with that.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.389 align:middle line:84%
There's another great
video clip that I

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
grabbed that I
want to show people

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.219 align:middle line:84%
because you're so
beautifully talking

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.310 align:middle line:90%
about relationships here.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And it changes what we're
talking about a little bit,

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.150 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to see how
what Marianne talks about

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.850 align:middle line:84%
can be brought into the context
of anything in your life.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.204 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:34:43.204 --> 00:34:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: In "A
Course in Miracles,"

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:84%
it talks about how religion and
psychotherapy, at their peak,

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:84%
are the same thing
because it all

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.070 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
healing of the mind.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And even though, when it comes
to romantic relationships

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and those kinds of attachments
with lovers and mates and all

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
that, we tend to get
pretty body oriented,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.210 align:middle line:84%
the truth of the
matter-- and anybody

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
knows this who has had much
experience with relationships.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.090 align:middle line:90%
So much goes on in the mind.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So when you heal your mind, you
heal every other relationship.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And in spiritual
terms, the idea here

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:84%
is that when you are at one
with your divine center,

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.040 align:middle line:84%
you will experience
oneness with other people.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.160 align:middle line:84%
If you take care of that
primary relationship,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.270 align:middle line:84%
God is your primary
relationship.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you take care of
the primary relationship,

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.740 align:middle line:84%
then you will find
yourself in alignment

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:90%
with other human relationships.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But when you are fractured
in your relationship

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.500 align:middle line:84%
to the divine, you
will find that fracture

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.980 align:middle line:84%
reflected in your
relationships with people.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So taking care of your
divine relationship

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:53.270 align:middle line:84%
is taking care of yourself
because your Self,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:57.800 align:middle line:84%
with a capital S, is only
found in your oneness with God.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you do not do that,
then you're missing something.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And you tend to project
on to other people

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:90%
that they can give it to you.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you are in
the realm of Self

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
with a capital S,
which can only be found

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.640 align:middle line:84%
through your
relationship to God,

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
then you saunter out into
the world a whole person,

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.902 align:middle line:84%
and you're not coming
from a wounded place

00:36:17.902 --> 00:36:19.360 align:middle line:84%
where you are
subconsciously trying

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.310 align:middle line:84%
to get somebody else
to complete you,

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to get somebody
else to fix you.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.440 align:middle line:90%
You're completed by God.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You're completed by something
which is within you.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't go out there
with this needy thing going on.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.880 align:middle line:84%
This energy of will
you come give it to me.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
You go out there
with a sense of being

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
a complete human
being who's looking

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:84%
for another complete
human being.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said to me-- a
woman at one of my seminars.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, she said,
well, the way you're talking

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.360 align:middle line:90%
about it, we wouldn't need men.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:90%
We're whole.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:90%
We're complete.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.315 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't need men.

00:36:53.315 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, but we
would desire men.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, a man
experiences need as control.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.740 align:middle line:84%
A man-- there's a line
that Pat Allen often says.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:84%
"A man produces into
a woman's desire."

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
When a woman is truly
complete in herself,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:84%
it's not a false, harsh
sense of independence.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a very surrendered place.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:84%
A person who knows how
to surrender to God

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
has surrender as one of
the notes they can play.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So a woman who is
truly independent

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is not independent
in the universe.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.080 align:middle line:84%
She's independent
of other people.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But she is very
dependent on her creator.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.300 align:middle line:90%
She's very dependent.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.690 align:middle line:90%
It makes us very pliable.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:90%
It makes us very surrendered.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But we're not looking to a
man to be the source of that.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman has her
spiritual connection together,

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.540 align:middle line:84%
then the way she is with
any other human being

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:90%
is independent within herself.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But in the right place,
with a trustable man,

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.289 align:middle line:84%
with a man who is
worthy of the job,

00:37:53.289 --> 00:37:55.330 align:middle line:84%
with a man who is strong
enough, with a man who's

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.915 align:middle line:84%
committed enough, with a man
who is worthy of the assignment

00:37:58.915 --> 00:37:59.864 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:37:59.864 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, that was
very, very wise advice.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And it applies to everything
in life, relationships, work,

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.780 align:middle line:84%
business, personal
life, and everything.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And so earlier, I asked
you your I am statement.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.810 align:middle line:90%
What is an I am statement?

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well,
the thing that I

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:84%
think most powerfully
guides me when

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I get off the spiritual
wagon is I am love.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm acting
in any other way,

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.924 align:middle line:90%
I am not being who I truly am.

00:38:31.924 --> 00:38:32.424 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:32.424 --> 00:38:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you, Lisa.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, it's
such a pleasure.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And such an honor.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh gosh!

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:40.706 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- there's one more
thing I wanted to talk about.

00:38:40.706 --> 00:38:43.472 align:middle line:84%
Your incredible journey
through the political scene.

00:38:43.472 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Oh, yeah.

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You left such a--

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I did journey
through the political scene.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be fair
for me to end this

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.020 align:middle line:84%
without talking about
that because I wanted--

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: And thank
you for your support.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And our last interview
was about that.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And you-- what is your
opinion or prospective

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:90%
about what you did?

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I personally feel you
changed the direction

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:03.711 align:middle line:84%
and left such a legacy with
what you did campaigning.

00:39:03.711 --> 00:39:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:05.209 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You truly did.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.082 align:middle line:84%
Every word you spoke
made a difference.

00:39:09.082 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: I never
felt, when I was running,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:84%
that if I won a congressional
seat, everything was OK now.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And I never felt that
if I lost, I would

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.460 align:middle line:90%
stop-- would close my mouth.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not there now.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And people go to marianne.com.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be doing a free
online progressive summit.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I personally feel strongly
and advocate very passionately

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:84%
for the candidacy
of Bernie Sanders.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.217 align:middle line:84%
But what I advocate for most
passionately is be involved.

00:39:37.217 --> 00:39:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel that those of us
who are part of the higher

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.815 align:middle line:84%
consciousness community
are the last people who

00:39:41.815 --> 00:39:44.560 align:middle line:84%
should be sitting out the great
social and political issues

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.640 align:middle line:84%
of our day because if you have
a clue as to what changes one

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.840 align:middle line:84%
life, you're somebody
who has a clue as to what

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:90%
would change the world.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yes.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.366 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: If love is
what would change one life,

00:39:53.366 --> 00:39:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and we believe so
strongly that it will,

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.860 align:middle line:84%
love is also what
would change the world.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And the world is
literally threatened.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The human race,
at this point, is

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:07.220 align:middle line:84%
threatened by the fear-based
collective behavior

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.870 align:middle line:90%
or our species.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the spiritual
community, the higher

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.880 align:middle line:84%
consciousness community,
felt separate from politics

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:90%
until you joined the scene.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.040 align:middle line:84%
You helped bridge that gap
because it's very easy to say,

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.350 align:middle line:90%
them, they.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.770 align:middle line:84%
However, our plight is
to heal the environment,

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.260 align:middle line:90%
heal human consciousness.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So yet that was
disconnected before,

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.560 align:middle line:84%
which you really did,
in a brilliant way,

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.480 align:middle line:84%
bridge the gap for
people in this community.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:28.690 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.736 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAMSON: Well if I
did in any way, shape,

00:40:30.736 --> 00:40:32.235 align:middle line:84%
or form, do what
you just said, then

00:40:32.235 --> 00:40:35.350 align:middle line:84%
it was worth every tear I cried
and every dollar that I lost,

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.150 align:middle line:90%
so thank you.

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.589 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to say
to you, I love your book.

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I think it's great.
