>>LISA GARR: Do you feel that
you look older than your age,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can't understand
the stubborn weight

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:90%
gain that you can't lose?

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
Are you beyond exhausted,
and no matter how much sleep

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:10%
you get, it's just not enough?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Is your libido running
your relationship?

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's ruining
your relationship.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Women everywhere are fed
up and for a good reason,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
people pleasing,
endless worry, striving

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:84%
to prove that you're valuable,
insecurity, overwhelm,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.980 align:middle line:90%
and crashing into burnout.

Dr. Keesha Ewers.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And she says, no more.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:90%
We deserve so much better.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Keesha is a board-certified
functional medicine specialist

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and an Ayurvedic

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.245 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KEESHA EWERS: It's so
wonderful to be here.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what is a
doctor of sexology?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Well, I
always tell people,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:90%
it's the best doctor ever.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I say
that is because I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:10%
am able to really delve
into human relationships.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:10%
People often think of sexology
as just sexual function

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:10%
in the bedroom.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
actually accurate.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I used to have all these people
coming and asking for hormone

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.423 align:middle line:90%
replacement therapy.

00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And I would start
asking questions

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
like, why do you think you need
hormone replacement therapy?

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, well,
you gave it to my sister,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:90%
my aunt, my daughter, my friend.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And they feel fantastic.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.333 align:middle line:90%
And I want some of that.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And so then I would
start saying, OK, so

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:90%
what's happening for you?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, my libido went to
Tahiti and left me behind--

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.252 align:middle line:84%
And so then I would start
asking questions like,

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
so when's the last time
you had a libido level

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:90%
that you were happy with?

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And I would get people
crying in my office--

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:90%
actually, men and women.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.270 align:middle line:90%
This tends to be a gender bias--

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:90%
of only women feel this way.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:90%
But it's not accurate.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Science shows us
that over 30% of men

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.548 align:middle line:84%
report low sexual desire at
some point in their lives.

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's just reported.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.608 align:middle line:84%
Because we know men
don't report things.

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it's interesting,
because most of the ads on TV

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
are about sexual
enhancement for men.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Exactly.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's sexual function.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Sexual desire is something
totally different.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to mishmash
all of this together.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So then I would say, like,
well, do you like your partner?

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And again, more tears.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, well,
estrogen, and progesterone,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
and testosterone aren't
going to help this.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's really delve to
the root of this problem.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to school
and got a PhD in this.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Because there was nowhere in
the medical literature that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
showed what I was seeing in my
office that, when someone is

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
hurt emotionally inside, when
they feel rejected, or not

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
good enough, or not pretty
enough, or the wrong weight,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that
women have going on--

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.422 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All these issues.

00:03:20.422 --> 00:03:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: --or men-- that
their sexual desire goes down.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And hormones don't
bring that back up.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
There are actually two
kinds of low libido.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
One is inherent, meaning there
has never been sexual desire

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:90%
ever for self or another.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And then there's acquired.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one of
the menopausal woman

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.210 align:middle line:84%
who had a wonderful sex life
with a partner and herself.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And then hormones tanked.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden,
she has no sexual desire.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And she says things like,
when I have sexual intercourse

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
with this partner
that I love, it

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
feels like I have cut
glass in my vagina.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
That one needs bioidentical
hormone replacement.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:90%
All the others don't.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.377 align:middle line:90%
And they're half and half.

00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:90%
So the inherited one--

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Inherent.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Inherent, OK.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.303 align:middle line:90%
So the inherent means that--

00:04:09.303 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Oftentimes,
there's been some trauma.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Trauma, OK.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
talking about today.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Or there's a mental
health issue like OCD, anxiety,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:84%
depression, some
neurotransmitter disorder,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
or genetic disorder
that has clicked

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
on when hormones came in
around 12 to 14 years of age.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And so then that
normal sexual desire

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that comes on at that
age never clicked on.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is there a link
between this unresolved sexual

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:90%
trauma-- any kind of trauma--

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.283 align:middle line:90%
and autoimmune disease?

00:04:40.283 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: There's a big link.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.825 align:middle line:84%
And that's such
a great question.

00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And I actually sat down and
wrote a book about this.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so much
science to show this.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of trauma in your
background-- and little spoiler

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:90%
alert, everybody's had some.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about that.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But any kind of trauma
in your background

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
actually sets up
your nervous system

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:90%
to go into fight or flight.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're in
that fight or flight,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
like there's a lion chasing
a zebra on the Savanna

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and the zebra thinks the
lion's about to eat it,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:90%
that actually signals the body.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.195 align:middle line:84%
And the body is just very
wisely wired to know,

00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
it's not safe to
reproduce right now.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not safe to stop and go
to the bathroom right now.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Memory changes to-- just look
at the horizon for safety.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And so everything shifts
to get you out of danger.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We're wired to be able to do
that for short periods of time,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:90%
not long periods of time.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:84%
When we get so that our little
gas pedal is stuck on go

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and we're always
in that state, we

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
release a stress hormone from
our little adrenal glands

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
that sit on top of the kidneys
that respond to the brain's

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:90%
signal that we're in danger.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And it releases cortisol
out into the body,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:84%
which breaks down the gut
wall, which then creates

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:90%
an immune system malfunction.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And we become very
hypervigilant against things

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:90%
in our environment.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, the
hypervigilance of the mind

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
is creating hypervigilance
in the body,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.407 align:middle line:84%
which puts us at a very
high risk for autoimmunity.

00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely
what happened to me.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pandemic in
our society right now.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me
about your story.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen to you?

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.242 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Yeah, so my
story is not unusual.

00:06:26.242 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:84%
People will hear it, and
they'll say, oh, gosh,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
thank goodness I didn't
have to go through that.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So I want everyone that hears it
to kind of take the filter off

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:90%
of the exact details.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And just think of trauma
as any form of rejection.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And fill that in for yourself.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: So when I was
10, I was a Navy brat.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And I lived 21 places
by the time I was 14.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:90%
So we moved a lot.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And we moved to a school.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And the vice principal
started sexually abusing me.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.055 align:middle line:84%
And so, in those
days-- and I don't

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
know if it's this way
in the schools anymore.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.627 align:middle line:84%
But you know those
intercom speakers

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
that would sit up
there in the corner?

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: That would
crackle to life.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.467 align:middle line:84%
Because we would do "The Pledge
of Allegiance" every morning.

00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So that would crackle
to life every morning.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.758 align:middle line:84%
We'd do "The Pledge
of Allegiance."

00:07:07.758 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And it would also
crackle to life

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day sometimes,
intermittently, infrequently,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and occasionally when
I couldn't predict

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
it to ask me to come to
the principal's office.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So every time--
it was Pavlovian.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Every time it would go off, I
would go off into that fight

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:90%
or flight response.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.122 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, of course.

00:07:26.122 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And so, when I
would hear that, "Mr. Smith,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:84%
will you please send Keesha
down to the principal's office,"

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:90%
I would get white knuckled.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I would stare at him,
begging him silently not

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:90%
to send me down there.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was being told
this was because I

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
was a bad kid by
the vice principal.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So I brought I brought
my second brain.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Can I show you my brain?

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.085 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:07:46.085 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
You travel with
another brain, perfect.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.262 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: I travel with a brain.

00:07:49.262 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Just in case one doesn't
work, I have another.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that I want
everyone to understand

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:84%
is our brain is not the same
from childhood until we die.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.448 align:middle line:84%
So as we age, it goes
through transitions.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you're young,
when you're a child,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
this front part is not
fully developed yet.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:90%
This is called our adult brain.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.400 align:middle line:90%
It's the prefrontal cortex.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
It's in charge of executive
function is what we call it.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
is why a lot of people

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:90%
can't lose weight.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're not
engaged in this part

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and they're more in their
fight or flight response,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.982 align:middle line:84%
they're going to go back to
childhood habits of wanting

00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:90%
sugar to soothe themselves.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
This is in charge of what
we put on a fork, what

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
we put in our cup, how we spend
our money, who we relate to

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:90%
and how.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:90%
This is everything.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're kids,
it's not fully developed

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:90%
till we're 26 years old.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.125 align:middle line:84%
That's why teenagers have
impulse control, parents,

00:08:43.125 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:84%
so that you understand your
kids a little bit better.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's why children need
to have that guidance that we

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.160 align:middle line:90%
give them.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And so in a situation like
mine and many children

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
don't have a well-attuned
caregiver right

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:90%
by their side at all times.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
When they get into a situation
that they don't understand,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:90%
they will make stuff up.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they want to try
and explain their world.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
be a little humans

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
in a world with big humans
and know their place.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, what I made
up is the world's not safe.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Because it wasn't.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:90%
That was accurate at the time.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And adults can't be trusted.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in that time where
I was, they couldn't.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, you
create an adaptation behavior

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:84%
to that belief that you
create when you're a kid.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And you carry those
into adulthood.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And mine in this
case was, I have

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:90%
to be perfect to even survive.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're constantly
operating from that childhood

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yes.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:84%
The beauty is is that, when
you get into adulthood,

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and this is fully
formed, and you're not

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
running so much on that
primal, reptilian brain,

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:84%
you actually get a chance to
go back and reframe that story

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:90%
and reclaim your power.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the healing
with all of this.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just set in stone.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
This just happens to have
happened at the time when

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:90%
this wasn't there yet.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So what is the link between
the trauma and the low libido

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and the autoimmunity?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: So inside--

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
open this brain

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And we have that reptilian
brain that I just alluded to.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Now this part here is called
our limbic system, our amygdala.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
We know from MRI scans now
of brains, of imaging--

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and when I did my study, I
did a lot of brain mapping.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw was, when
you go through trauma

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
as a child-- let's call it
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:90%
PTSD.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are familiar
with that terminology--

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:84%
we actually get shrinkage
in adulthood of this part,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:90%
the executive adult function.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And we get growth in the
right side of our amygdala.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:90%
So this also is triggered.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And it happens with people
that say that they're

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:90%
constantly overwhelmed.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
You do not have had to
have had sexual trauma,

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
domestic violence,
psychological, emotional,

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
spiritual trauma
for this to happen.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
We now know from
brain imaging scans

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
that, if you say to
yourself that you

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
are overwhelmed every single
day of your life, this shrinks.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.540 align:middle line:90%
This grows.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can you reverse it?

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: You can.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.877 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:11:19.877 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I never talk about anything
that's not reversible.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: You absolutely can.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
It's called a
perceived stress scale.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And so if you go into your life
and your day with, oh, my gosh,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I get to live my mission and
my purpose, and I'm busy,

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so excited, then
you're not perceiving

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:90%
that as a stressful thing.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:90%
I have four kids.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
If I say, oh, I'm
raising four children

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so excited that I
have these beautiful beings

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.160 align:middle line:84%
around me rather
than, oh, my gosh,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
they're sucking
everything dry from me--

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
it's all about the way
we perceive things.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It affects the actual
physiology of our brain.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You have four kids.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: I'm empty nested now
as of just a couple of months

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.190 align:middle line:90%
ago-- but, yes.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do we go from
that place of killing ourselves

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:90%
to thriving?

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: So that's a
really good question.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And you heard me say that
it's so much about perception.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, you
have to borrow a brain.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I don't
mean my plastic brain.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean a therapist.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I call therapy
borrowing a brain.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It's somebody that
can look at patterns,

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and recognize what's going on,
and show you what's happening,

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and help you reorganize
your pattern.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Would it help to
get a brain scan like this?

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Not necessary unless
you're showing actual cognitive

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
by that is, let's

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
say that you're suspicious that
you've got MS, because there's

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
something going on
physiologically,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
or Alzheimer's, and dementia,
and those kinds of things.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
There are centers
around the country that

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
do brain imaging for kids
with oppositional behavior,

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:84%
things that are going
on that nobody can fix,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's really impacting
life in a terrible way.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I always recommend
having an MRI for that.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what would you
see, the front cortex being--

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.485 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: It depends.

00:13:16.485 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll see different
parts of the brain light

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:90%
up for different things.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And does it matter
if it's a different color,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.470 align:middle line:90%
or are there holes in the brain?

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Yeah, so
that shrinkage,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that atrophy of that prefrontal
cortex shows up as holes.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing
is is, around the country,

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:90%
we're legalizing marijuana.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.567 align:middle line:84%
And there's a really
interesting thing

00:13:40.567 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that happens with
the brain-- that you

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:84%
can look at images of
people that don't use

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.690 align:middle line:90%
marijuana and people that do.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are holes in that
same area of the brain.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Of those that do that.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Of those that do.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, just because
it's legal, doesn't

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
mean it's a good
thing for your brain.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm-mm.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.885 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about
all kinds of trauma.

00:13:57.885 --> 00:13:58.685 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yes.

00:13:58.685 --> 00:14:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's not
just sexual trauma.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:90%
It could be emotional.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yes.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What happened if the
trauma is in the adult years?

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Does the same thing happen?

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: It does.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to
actually differentiate

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.230 align:middle line:90%
is two kinds of trauma.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
There's capital T Trauma and
there's lower case t trauma.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about
capital T Trauma,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.841 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
domestic violence.

00:14:20.841 --> 00:14:22.466 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
physical, and we're

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:84%
talking about
emotional, and we're

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.515 align:middle line:84%
talking about psychological,
and spiritual trauma.

00:14:28.515 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
lower case t trauma,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.015 align:middle line:84%
it's the one that I was
talking about before,

00:14:32.015 --> 00:14:34.860 align:middle line:84%
where we feel overwhelmingly
stressed and burned out,

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.435 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing left.

00:14:36.435 --> 00:14:38.577 align:middle line:84%
And this is just like the
flight attendant saying,

00:14:38.577 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
you have to put your oxygen mask
on yourself before you put it

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:90%
on your child.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the, I call--

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.583 align:middle line:84%
the women of our time trying
to bring home the bacon,

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:84%
fry it up in the pan, and
look out at the same time.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.083 align:middle line:90%
And we're burning ourselves out.

00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:84%
We're actually not
wired and designed

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
to be able to maintain such
an intense level of stress.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But there is research that shows
that the right amount of stress

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:90%
is what we need.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
it as a bell curve,

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:84%
if you hit the center, which is
enough stress to challenge you,

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.262 align:middle line:84%
enough to make you
reach beyond what

00:15:12.262 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:90%
you think you're capable of--

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exercise does that.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Exactly.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect metaphor.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Positive stress, yes.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.547 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: If you
just go like this,

00:15:18.547 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to get
developed bicep muscle.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:84%
If you put a weight in your
hand, now you have resistance.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I always think of life
as a spiritual gymnasium.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And so all of these events--

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:84%
you see me talking about my
experience of sexual abuse.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:90%
And I have a smile on my face.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:90%
And that might creep people out.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: But the thing
of it is is I now

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
look at it as that resistance
training from life that

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:90%
made me who I am today.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And so at the end
of the day, I never

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:90%
look at challenges as bad.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
They just happen to be the
resistance training of life.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a way--

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and you are going
to talk about this--

00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:84%
of how to go into the
memory and take the heat off

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.228 align:middle line:90%
of it, which is helpful.

00:16:03.228 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
through that in a second.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
First, I want to talk
about the levels of trauma

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that people experience
and how it does impact.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.707 align:middle line:84%
And this could also had
to do with the whole gig

00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
economy, and the side
hustle, and everything

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that we have in life is
constantly taxing us.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It's same thing, right?

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: It is.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's research that shows
that, by the time we leave

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the house in the morning,
a lot of our willpower

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is already used up, because
we have so many hits to it.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
We just have so much
sensory input these days.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're called on to be in so
many different places at once

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:90%
just on our computer.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that this
is really impacting us

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
level of stress we

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:90%
perceive ourselves to be under.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.255 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's about
really re-framing that.

00:16:50.255 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about
a way to do that.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But what we now
do know is that--

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:84%
the Adverse Childhood
Experiences study

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
was looking at these big,
capital T Trauma instances.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:84%
It was conducted by Kaiser
Permanente and the Centers

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:84%
for Disease Control
between 1995 and 1997--

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
the biggest study of its
kind, over 3,000 participants.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it
even came to be

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:84%
is because Kaiser had
a weight loss clinic.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And it was really productive.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:84%
People were successfully losing
the weight they wanted to lose.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But there was a portion that
was dropping out before they

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:90%
had reached their goal.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.547 align:middle line:84%
And luckily, the director was
very curious and went back

00:17:33.547 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and start interviewing the
people that were dropping out

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that were successfully
losing weight

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and found out that a lot of
them had been sexually abused.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that got him thinking
about this impact of trauma

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:90%
on adult choices.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they coupled with the
Centers for Disease Control

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:90%
and did this giant study.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
What they found is they only
looked at 10 different kinds

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:90%
of abuse, you could say.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And they are those
that I was just

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.450 align:middle line:84%
talking about, sexual,
physiological, psychological,

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:90%
emotional, spiritual abuse.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But also, watching mom
get abused was one--

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:90%
having some kind of loss.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, my
dad was out to sea

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
all the time when
I was growing up.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually
considered an ACE score.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Having a divorce
in your childhood,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
having a parent incarcerated,
having a parent or a caregiver

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:84%
addicted to drugs or
alcohol, just neglect

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:90%
is considered an ACE score.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And the higher that
ACE score, the higher

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
your risk for all of the
long-term, chronic things

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:90%
that we see in adulthood.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Autoimmune.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:90%
And what about digestion?

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:90%
How does this impact--

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned that earlier--

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:90%
the gut.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Yeah, the zebra
being chased by a lion.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if you believe
that you're stressed,

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
then you actually shut down
all of your digestive system

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.818 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't have to
stop and go to the bathroom

00:18:58.818 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
while there's something on
your tail trying to eat you.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, yeah.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And then does it impact
the biome in the gut?

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yes, absolutely.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that cortisol that's
released as a stress response

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:90%
kills and changes the interior.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:84%
You start loosening up the
cells that line the gut wall.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And now bad bugs can get
into the center of that.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:90%
We call that dysbiosis.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:90%
And they live in those spaces.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.705 align:middle line:84%
I always call it apartment
complexes for these bad bugs.

00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a leaky gut.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: That's a leaky
gut and dysbiosis.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.652 align:middle line:84%
And the two of those together
will create an environment

00:19:33.652 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%
that makes it impossible
for you to lose weight

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:90%
no matter how hard you try.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.232 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
how many people come

00:19:38.232 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
to see me in my medical practice
that say that they work out six

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:90%
days a week, seven days a week.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:90%
They're doing everything right.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's that
stubborn weight.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: They're eating right.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But they have got
this leaky gut issue

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that's happened as a result
of either taking antibiotics

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
for years, or
steroids for years,

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
or using non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs

00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:90%
for years.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:90%
But stress is the number one.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.747 align:middle line:84%
What about blood
sugar regulation?

00:20:04.747 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: So yeah,
there's some pillars

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
that you can think of
in terms of health.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And I always like to take this.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine is the
sister science of yoga.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a 10,000-year-old framework
of science from a long time

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is the people
that were observing humans

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:84%
in India and their relationship
to the climate, to the stars,

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:84%
to each other, to food,
to the aging process,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:84%
they developed this beautiful
medical arm of yoga,

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
you could call it, called
Ayurvedic medicine.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And translated into English,
it means the science of life.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
a owner's manual

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that you wish you'd
had when you were born,

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
the care and feeding of
each individual human.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.082 align:middle line:90%
Because we're not all the same.

00:20:48.082 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that they say

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:84%
is that we're more than
just our physical self.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
the physical body.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Then we have an energetic body.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
We have an emotional
body, a wisdom body

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and then this fifth layer that
they call the anandamaya kosha

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:90%
that is your portal to bliss.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
It's what Carl Jung used to
call the collective unconscious.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.013 align:middle line:90%
And that's your access to that.

00:21:11.013 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
That's where you get those
epiphanies in the shower,

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.008 align:middle line:84%
and you get the solutions
to your problems.

00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:90%
It's when you're in that place.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, yes.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: But if you're toxic
in any of those other layers,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.062 align:middle line:84%
you don't get good
access to that spot.

00:21:22.062 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to get the
other layers right before you--

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.187 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: You have to
get them all right.

00:21:26.187 --> 00:21:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, when we talk about
the pillars of health,

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.580 align:middle line:84%
or nutrition, or nourishment,
then I always take that,

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and I integrate it
with these five layers.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we start
talking about digestion,

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just talking about
the digestion of your food.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the digestion
of your emotions, also,

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:90%
of your experiences.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
properly digested.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.115 align:middle line:84%
And Ayurvedic medicine
says, autoimmune disease

00:21:52.115 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:90%
is undigested anger.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So when I was diagnosed
with rheumatoid arthritis

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:90%
when I was 30--

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:90%
23 years ago--

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I was able to reverse
it within six months

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:84%
by learning to digest the anger
I never felt from my trauma

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.240 align:middle line:90%
in my past.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I had put it in a
nice little box in my closet.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's not
wheat allergies or--

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: It's all of it.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk about the
body, you talk about, OK,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.490 align:middle line:84%
so what is it that
your body wants to eat?

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And the more broken
down your gut

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:84%
wall is, the more
food sensitivities

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And I found at that
time that I, indeed--

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and I have a genetic issue
with wheat, also-- with gluten.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.173 align:middle line:90%
I cannot do gluten.

00:22:33.173 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Me, too, yeah.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: I cannot do dairy.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.640 align:middle line:90%
I can't do sugar.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And I don't.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that was part
of the healing for me.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.733 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't get me
all the way there.

00:22:43.733 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind of patient
that I see in my practice.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Doing "everything
right," all the food

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
stuff, all the functional

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:90%
testing.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't learned
that they haven't digested

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
their emotions, and their
experiences, and their thoughts

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:90%
properly.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
digest emotions?

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: How do you
digest your emotions?

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that fascinating to think
of digesting your emotions?

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So the way that you
do that is you really

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:90%
stay present with it.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:90%
You say, instead of--

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, so a lot of people that
might be watching this show

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
are very spiritually
aware people.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:90%
It's "The Aware Show," right?

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: So it's all
about inspiration.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can do this process
called spiritual bypass,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
where we say, I'm not going
to feel any negative emotion.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to go up here.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: I don't allow
myself to be angry.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just dial up the
vibrational level to here.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's a little kid
part of yourself in there

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that had a right to feel angry
about something that happened.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And you've actually
denied that emotion,

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:90%
which is a human emotion.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have to move beyond the
judgment of the emotion to--

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
sadness is OK to feel as
long as it doesn't get stuck.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And so is anger.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And so is anger, and so
is jealousy, and so is hatred.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As long as
it's not directed at--

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Right.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:84%
You get to feel those things
as long as you're actually--

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
if you get stuck in them,
it's like being constipated.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's the emotional flip side
of the physiological response.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Constipation is holding
on to your crap.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And so you can get
emotionally constipated.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can get
spiritually constipated.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And so realizing
that and allowing

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:84%
yourself to move through your
emotions is really important.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But first, you have to
acknowledge that you

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.630 align:middle line:90%
have a right to feel it.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I always call
emotions the symphony.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
realistic to think

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:84%
you're only going to
hear twinkly flutes when

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:90%
you go to the symphony.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you're going to
hear the kettle drums, and then

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.305 align:middle line:90%
tympani, and all of those--

00:24:42.305 --> 00:24:43.105 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Dimensions.

00:24:43.105 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: --dimension.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just
understanding that, oh,

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
there's something for me
to learn from this space.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I can develop into
a higher developmental state.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:84%
First, you have to be
able to feel the feelings.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Because they're in your
body no matter what.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.412 align:middle line:84%
Whether you like it
or not, they're there.

00:24:59.412 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you usually
don't realize it.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And you
don't realize it.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.877 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, we walk around
as little heads, like my brain.

00:25:05.877 --> 00:25:07.085 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, pretty much so.

00:25:07.085 --> 00:25:07.885 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Exactly.

00:25:07.885 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
You're walking around like
a head without a body.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I always say, people
with autoimmune disease

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:84%
are in a combative
relationship with themselves.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Because their immune
system is attacking them.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do we go after quick
fixes, like things to cope,

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.193 align:middle line:90%
caffeine, or drugs, or whatnot?

00:25:27.193 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: That is what
we do as a general rule,

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:90%
like the standard American diet.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.177 align:middle line:84%
That is what the
American way is.

00:25:33.177 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Comfort food, yes.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Yet, it's not a
functional way of doing this.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't get you anywhere.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It actually just creates
this temporary fix

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
of a symptom that
has a long-term side

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:90%
effect down the road.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you really
want to break the pattern,

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:84%
then you have to be able
to feel the emotion.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have a whole process
that I do where you say, OK,

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:84%
so let's say that you were in
a conversation of conflict--

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:90%
which is totally normal.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.345 align:middle line:84%
Conflict is normal
inside of a marriage.

00:26:01.345 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:90%
So you're with your spouse.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
conflict-laden subject matter

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that you have returned back
to again in your marriage.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So in order to not keep
repeating the same pattern

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and going in these
circular conversations that

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:84%
affect your libido, and your
health, and your relationship

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:84%
itself, if you can stop
for a second and say, OK,

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:84%
how do I feel right now when
I am having this conversation

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:90%
that's full of conflict?

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel scared?

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel anxious?

Do you feel angry?

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Anger is always a hard crust
over the top with something

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:90%
softer.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.310 align:middle line:90%

down underneath the angry crust

00:26:38.768 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:90%
and say, what do I really feel?

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I feel panic.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I feel anxious.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I have no power.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any control.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I don't have control,
then what do I feel about that?

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.480 align:middle line:90%
It's always going to be fear.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Ultimately,
under anger is fear.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Well, no,
lack of control.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:90%

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: We try and

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:90%

>>EWERS: --feeling fear.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you can access
that and you say, OK,

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:84%
so where in my body
do I feel this fear,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:84%
you will have a place that
got set up in childhood.

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Every child feels fear.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Every adult feels fear.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.052 align:middle line:90%
So you go to that place.

00:27:14.052 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
feel it in their gut.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.885 align:middle line:84%
Some feel it in their
shoulders, some in their jaw,

00:27:17.885 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:90%
some in their chest.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or all of them.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Or all of
it together, exactly.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:90%
And you say, OK.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And you just check
in with your body.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you can say,
when's the first time I

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:90%
remember feeling that feeling?

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And just be open to
whatever it comes up.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh, when I was five and
my baby sister was born--

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:84%
that's actually a
big, common one--

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.870 align:middle line:90%
lack of control.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:84%
A new family member drops into
the center of your happy, rosy

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%
little home.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one
for a lot of people.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And you feel rejected often.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I do a lot of
therapy on a lot of people.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's a huge one.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:28:00.248 align:middle line:84%
So you can go back to, oh-- or
I had a special needs sibling,

00:28:00.248 --> 00:28:02.040 align:middle line:84%
where they were getting
a lot of attention.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.855 align:middle line:84%
And it's not OK to feel
jealous and resentful of that.

00:28:07.855 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
You haven't given yourself
permission to feel that.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is no
permission in the household.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: It is locked
in here, exactly.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So accessing that
and saying, oh--

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
then you go back, and you get
that little kid part of you,

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:20.957 align:middle line:84%
and you give them permission
to have their feelings.

00:28:20.957 --> 00:28:22.207 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In that moment, right?

00:28:22.207 --> 00:28:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And you sit

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:90%

I've got this now.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
say anything

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:84%
you want, and I
will hear you, 24/7.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Who is the likely
person to understand

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.040 align:middle line:84%
exactly what are the words
that you need to say-- is you.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And we always look for that
from outside of ourselves.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.150 align:middle line:84%
We want our spouse
to do it for us.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or a therapist.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to sit
there in that pain

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that you would be in,
to say, this was wrong,

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.040 align:middle line:90%
and who does that?

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:90%
It's injust in the world.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Right.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be able
to have that time.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
move beyond that, too.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what actually
#MeToo right now is.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.470 align:middle line:10%
It's a toddler
developmental state

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:10%
of our culture, where
we're moving from silence,

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:10%
which is pre-verbal infancy, to
toddlers saying, he touched me.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.020 align:middle line:10%
He hurt me.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.200 align:middle line:90%
We need to have our voice.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.690 align:middle line:84%
We need to be able to say
that if that happened to us.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But we can't get stuck there
with blaming and shaming.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to then move into
our developmental levels

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, so now, what
am I to learn from that?

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.260 align:middle line:90%
How do I find my voice?

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:10%
How do I advocate for myself?

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:10%
And then, how do I
move into forgiveness?

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:10%
And people often will confuse
forgiveness and reconciliation.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.190 align:middle line:84%
When I got to the
forgiveness process

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.470 align:middle line:84%
for my sexual perpetrator, I
didn't call him up and say,

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.770 align:middle line:90%
let's go have tea.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, I did all
of this on my own.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I knew that
this isn't someone

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I want to reconcile with.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness and reconciliation
are two different things.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.590 align:middle line:90%
You have to forgive.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, the
bitterness stays in your body.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.670 align:middle line:90%
And you will get sick from it.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:90%
You do not have to reconcile.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You don't have

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Do not

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:84%

it's what's called a

they've hurt you, done

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and apologized--

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.030 align:middle line:84%
if they're not still a
dangerous person in your life.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
If they are, you
do not reconcile.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:90%

you never reconcile with them,

Yeah.

Yeah, because that was a
misuse of power from somebody

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that was an adult in
charge of children.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
parents that haven't

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.060 align:middle line:84%
been really great parents for
children that are now adults.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:84%

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And also, if your

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:84%
not one that

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.747 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to reconcile.

learn to say no.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all--
we can relate to that

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and having the entire cafeteria
laugh at you-- public shaming.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Totally.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: He spent the next two
years in the library eating.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And his belief he
created about himself

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:57.480 align:middle line:84%
was that he was stupid,
and clumsy, and didn't

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.300 align:middle line:90%
deserve to be around people.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And his adaptation
behavior that he created

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
was to be shy, and
introverted, and hide.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It was getting in his way
as a corporate executive

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.940 align:middle line:84%
when he had to
give presentations

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.750 align:middle line:90%
in front of people.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.510 align:middle line:84%
He came to see me,
because he had a condition

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.480 align:middle line:90%
of sweating profusely.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And his dress shirts were
always covered in sweat stains.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he came to
me wanting me to fix

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.290 align:middle line:90%
that physiological problem.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:90%
And we delved into--

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.560 align:middle line:90%
and this story came out.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's perfectionism.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Perfectionism is present
and every single person

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.920 align:middle line:90%
with autoimmune disease.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And many of the people
listening to us right now

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.080 align:middle line:84%
don't even know they have
or they're cooking up

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.230 align:middle line:90%
an autoimmune disease.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It can take anywhere
from 10 to 30 years

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.440 align:middle line:90%
to actually develop one.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
For me, I had my sexual
trauma when I was 10.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.810 align:middle line:84%
When I was 30, It was like a
little turkey timer inside me--

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:90%
ping.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:84%
You have RA,
Rheumatoid Arthritis,

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:00.210 align:middle line:84%
an incurable autoimmune disease
according to Western standards.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:84%
My doctor gave me
prescriptions and said,

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.318 align:middle line:84%
come back when you
get worse-- not if.

00:34:05.318 --> 00:34:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked if there was
anything I could do with diet--

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I was already a marathon runner,
made everything from scratch.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I was a healthy
person in my mind.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.420 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, this
is because you just

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.210 align:middle line:84%
drew the short end of
the genetic lottery.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather had had RA.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So indeed, that gene
had been flipped on.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Activated.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And so this is a
really important point--

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.270 align:middle line:84%
is that perfectionism
leads to illness.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.213 align:middle line:84%
And most people that are
perfectionists don't know it.

00:34:33.213 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:90%
They don't realize it.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just their standard,
norm way of being.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there
is no perfectionism.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.055 align:middle line:84%
It can never be
perfect enough to--

00:34:43.055 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And
perfectionists will say

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that, because the bar is set
so high in their own mind

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.885 align:middle line:90%
that they say, are you kidding?

00:34:49.885 --> 00:34:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how far
I am from that bar?

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.239 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I'm
a perfectionist.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's only those
people that say that.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.720 align:middle line:90%
They're actually perfectionists.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, that
happens to me.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, an imperfect voice
is driving me nuts.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Oh, it's sexy.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, OK.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:05.200 align:middle line:90%
We'll go with that.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.235 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Reframe.

00:35:06.235 --> 00:35:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: From the sexologist.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: That's right.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.233 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'll go with that.

00:35:09.233 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: That's right.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do we
repair this level of shame?

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: So like I said before,
people usually come and see me

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.770 align:middle line:90%
for something other than this.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:84%
People don't automatically say,
I want to go fix my trauma.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they have
something that's happening.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:84%
They're having
relationship issues.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.080 align:middle line:90%
They're overweight.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.560 align:middle line:84%
They are having some
kind of skin thing

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.400 align:middle line:90%
that's showing up in the mirror.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.200 align:middle line:90%
They're fatigued.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:84%
They can't think of
anything properly anymore.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:90%
So they come to see me for that.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they find
out that, oh, it's

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.230 align:middle line:84%
what I call the freedom
framework-- that there

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.130 align:middle line:84%
are these four corner pieces
of solving their puzzle.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Anytime we solve a puzzle,
we have four corner pieces.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're the
same for everyone--

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
genetics, your digestive health,
your level of toxic exposure

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.750 align:middle line:84%
including your thoughts,
and how willing and able

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.300 align:middle line:90%
you are to detox those.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one is past
trauma and current-day stress.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So you asked earlier
if adult trauma

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.850 align:middle line:90%
can cause this-- absolutely.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.090 align:middle line:84%
This can up-regulate your
genetic expression, too.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So for 23 years,
I haven't had RA.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I still have that gene.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.030 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather had.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You deactivated it.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:90%
You literally did.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: I changed
the way it manifests.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's amazing.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: So I do genetic testing
on every one of my patients

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:90%
for this reason--

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:84%
not because I'm looking for
a gene linked to a disease.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking to see which
ones are there that we can

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.410 align:middle line:90%
deactivate, to use your words.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.212 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Before they activate.

00:36:43.212 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Or turn them off if
they're already in front of me

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.720 align:middle line:90%
with a problem.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's take a look here
at Dr. Keesha Ewers talking

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.130 align:middle line:84%
at the Harvard Business School
about the Unbroken Program.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:54.930 align:middle line:90%

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.790 align:middle line:84%
- This is why I created
the You Unbroken Program,

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:84%
to help people who had
adverse childhood experiences

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.450 align:middle line:90%
deal with them in adulthood.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:84%
It's why I wrote
about it in my book,

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.440 align:middle line:90%
"Solving the Autoimmune Puzzle."

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It's why I teach all my health
coaches about how to heal this.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It's why every patient
that comes into my practice

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.060 align:middle line:84%
starts with the ABCs
of trauma healing,

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
even though they don't
that's happening.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.830 align:middle line:90%
A, the ACES quiz--

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:26.120 align:middle line:84%
those questions get asked
but in a roundabout way,

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.380 align:middle line:90%
so they don't know.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:84%
B, beliefs-- our brains
are not fully developed

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:90%
until we're 26 years old.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.270 align:middle line:84%
That means, when we have
an adverse childhood

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:41.170 align:middle line:84%
experience as a kid,
our brains are immature.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.390 align:middle line:90%
We make stuff up.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:84%

or cute girl in the lunchroom,

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.400 align:middle line:84%
don't get picked for
the baseball team,

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.900 align:middle line:90%
flunk your first test--

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:84%
these are all adverse
childhood experiences.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And they impact your
health and the quality

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:84%
of your relationships depending
on what you started believing

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.620 align:middle line:90%
about them at that time.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.273 align:middle line:10%
C, connect the dots between
those beliefs, the behaviors

00:38:09.273 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:10%
that emerged from
them, and what's

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.930 align:middle line:10%
on the end of your fork,
how you're processing

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:17.290 align:middle line:10%
your information and your
stressors, how you're sleeping,

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:20.230 align:middle line:10%
how you're moving-- all of it.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:24.160 align:middle line:10%
I am not a victim
of sexual abuse.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I am not a victim of
a body who betrayed me

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.310 align:middle line:84%
by autoimmune disease
and tried to kill me.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.920 align:middle line:84%

They made me stronger, more
resilient, more compassionate,

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
a better mother, wife, healer,
coach, guide, and entrepreneur.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.120 align:middle line:10%
You are not a victim,
unless you choose it.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to reframe your
story to reclaim your health,

00:39:27.673 --> 00:39:29.090 align:middle line:84%
listening to some
of my colleagues

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:90%
present their science.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I presented my study, and
my science, and my work.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.600 align:middle line:84%
In listening to other
people, every one of them

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.260 align:middle line:84%
had a story of
distress in childhood.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And I remember turning to
my colleague and saying,

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.140 align:middle line:84%
my kids haven't had
enough to fight against.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:84%
We really try so hard
to protect our children.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I really tried hard to make
their childhood very magical.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day,
is that really a great thing

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:90%
to do?

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.795 align:middle line:84%
Are we keeping the
resistance training?

00:39:58.795 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't want my
kids to be sexually abused.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them
to be kidnapped.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, have they had enough

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.910 align:middle line:90%
to struggle against?

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Because every single person
in there that had made

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.630 align:middle line:84%
a giant contribution
to the world

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.870 align:middle line:90%
had some kind of struggle.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Trauma.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yeah.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So when I do this freedom
framework, and I present it,

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.222 align:middle line:84%
and I tell you about it,
I'm solving your puzzle

00:40:21.222 --> 00:40:22.430 align:middle line:90%
when I'm doing this with you.

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:24.290 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also trying
to help you move out

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:28.230 align:middle line:84%
of the judgment space of
that's good, that's bad.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Or I'm good, I'm bad.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Exactly.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no good and bad food.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.510 align:middle line:84%
There's food that your body
will react to in a different way

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:90%
than it will for another one.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.590 align:middle line:84%
There's also non-food
that we call food.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Anything you open
up out of a package

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that you've got at the
Mini Mart is not food.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, no, not anymore.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Exactly.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
think in those terms

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.570 align:middle line:84%
when I go through the
Freedom Framework.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So the Freedom
Framework is the way

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that I design really
approaching everybody

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that comes to see me that
has a puzzle that we're

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:90%
trying to solve.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, every
time we take a box

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and we put the puzzle
pieces on the table,

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:05.930 align:middle line:84%
we always look for the
four corner pieces first.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we start looking
for the edge pieces.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So the edges are what I call
the four pillars of the Freedom

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Framework.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.480 align:middle line:84%
The first one is to
uncover the root causes.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we always have to look
at the root cause of anything.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And that will be
found in the body.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:22.100 align:middle line:84%
It'll be found in the mind,
and the heart, and the spirit,

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and in the story I really listen
to how people tell their story.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.460 align:middle line:84%
If it's laden with
victimization,

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I know we have to start
there, because it's

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:90%
a disempowered way of being.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.655 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that hasn't
been digested properly yet.

00:41:36.655 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:90%
And then the second--

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.910 align:middle line:84%
well, to stick to
that first pillar

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.890 align:middle line:84%
first, if we're
looking at the body,

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:45.320 align:middle line:84%
that's functional medicine
laboratory testing.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.160 align:middle line:90%
It's genetics.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.750 align:middle line:90%
It's looking at your microbiome.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at
food sensitivities.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.160 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at your
hormones and your adrenals.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Who's living in your gut?

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.070 align:middle line:84%
All of that is
part of that part.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The data.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Really important.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.120 align:middle line:90%
So we're looking for those.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So that second
edge piece is going

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.233 align:middle line:90%
to be to confront that data.

00:42:05.233 --> 00:42:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to be your weight

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:07.942 align:middle line:90%
that you get off of your scale.

00:42:07.942 --> 00:42:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
your libido level.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I look at libido as
whole life vitality,

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.590 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily sexual.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at, are you
excited about the things

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.760 align:middle line:90%
you've been excited about?

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Or have you gone dull?

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.278 align:middle line:90%
Is your light off?

00:42:23.278 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Where is the joy?

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Exactly.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Or have you always
wanted to write a book,

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.763 align:middle line:90%
but you're not getting anywhere?

00:42:27.763 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:84%
You're just binge
watching Netflix.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.940 align:middle line:90%
So we're looking at that data.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.530 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
the laboratory data

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:38.030 align:middle line:84%
that we just talked about, your
quality of sleep, your mood.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:90%
That's all data.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.700 align:middle line:90%
It's feedback from your body.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Then the third is going
to be to really connect

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:84%
the dots between that data
and your lifestyle choices.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, people
like to disconnect the fact

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that they're
rewarding themselves

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.710 align:middle line:84%
with the pastry and the fact
that they have joint pain.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.495 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
want to acknowledge

00:42:59.495 --> 00:43:00.620 align:middle line:90%
that those two go together.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Overeating
and weight gain.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Exactly.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's a disconnect.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Right.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, like I said,
they're not overeating,

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.070 align:middle line:84%
but there's some
bugs in the gut that

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:84%
are creating the issue
with not losing weight.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Or there's a food sensitivity.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're eating
a lot of coconut oil

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're not genetically
able to manage that fat.

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Or you have a food
sensitivity to it,

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:27.020 align:middle line:84%
but you read somewhere that
good fats are good for you.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not true for
every single person.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So you have to actually connect
the dots between your data

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.210 align:middle line:90%
and your lifestyle choices.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: This is so detailed.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I love this, yes.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Because there is
never a one-size-fits-all.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.830 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say that good fats
will make you lose weight,

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.520 align:middle line:84%
because it is inaccurate for
25% of the population that carry

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.700 align:middle line:84%
a certain gene that actually
don't metabolize fats very

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.600 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.600 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.401 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:43:52.401 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And then if you look at it
from an Ayurvedic standpoint,

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:58.790 align:middle line:84%
the kapha body type--
which I'm a pitta kapha.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I can't have that
much fat, either.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Sugar, fat, and processed
foods, and grains

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.290 align:middle line:90%
actually make me gain weight.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's ever going to be
the same formula for everyone.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why this Freedom
Framework is so important.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the last edge
piece, the bottom of it,

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.890 align:middle line:84%
is to create the life that you
want with intention instead

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of what I call the
factory default

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.160 align:middle line:90%
settings from childhood.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being
run by this idea

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that I have to be
perfect to survive,

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I have to reframe,
and reclaim my power,

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and recreate the life that
I actually want to live,

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:84%
not one that's driven from
the unconscious belief system.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's amazing
to think that success

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.690 align:middle line:90%
comes from that trauma.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yes.

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Success only comes
from that trauma

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.347 align:middle line:90%
if you have digested it well.

00:44:47.347 --> 00:44:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
you'll run yourself

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.240 align:middle line:84%
into the ground trying
to be successful.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is
healthy success then?

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Success where you
can enjoy your life still,

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.190 align:middle line:84%
that you don't feel
overwhelmed, and overstressed.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And your children
look at you and don't

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.180 align:middle line:90%
say, who are you again?

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't recognize you.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.555 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Exactly-- that
you've learned to balance.

00:45:08.555 --> 00:45:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the whole Freedom

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Framework is-- is learning
how to find that balance.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go
through those other three

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:17.760 align:middle line:84%
before you can get to the create
the life you actually want.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain chemicals,
the messenger chemicals

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:23.340 align:middle line:84%
from your brain called
neurotransmitters--

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.290 align:middle line:84%
you have to measure
all these things,

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:28.260 align:middle line:84%
see what you are doing to
make them go off the rails,

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.230 align:middle line:84%
fix those before you
can get to that place

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:35.580 align:middle line:84%
of nonjudgmental radical
acceptance, joy for the life

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:90%
that you really want to lead.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.510 align:middle line:90%
We try to bypass all of that.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you also
relayed a lot of this

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.580 align:middle line:90%
to archetypes, right?

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yes.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So I've talked a little bit
about the victim archetype.

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Archetypes are a
really amazing way

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:54.150 align:middle line:84%
of understanding why you do
what you do in the world.

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I use another framework
called the Enneagram.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a
way that your ego

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.200 align:middle line:84%
created a strategy
to get its needs

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.850 align:middle line:90%
met when you were a child.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:08.850 align:middle line:84%
They are the operating code on
your computer from childhood.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And you get to go
back, and you get

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:12.690 align:middle line:84%
to upgrade that
once you discover

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that it's there when you
have a fully-formed brain

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.120 align:middle line:90%
in adulthood.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.442 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you go
into the feeling,

00:46:22.442 --> 00:46:23.400 align:middle line:90%
in all of the feelings.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.120 align:middle line:90%
And you sit with them.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And you then become aware of
what it is you're running,

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.750 align:middle line:90%
whatever archetype that is.

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:middle line:90%
What is the next step?

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: It depends.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:36.040 align:middle line:84%
This, again, is not
going to be a cookbook

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.320 align:middle line:90%
for every single person--

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.480 align:middle line:90%
which is so frustrating.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember being in
my Ayurvedic training.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.275 align:middle line:84%
And I'd raise my
hand, ask my teacher,

00:46:43.275 --> 00:46:45.150 align:middle line:84%
so what if this, and
this, and this happened?

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And every single time,
he would say, it depends.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.130 align:middle line:90%
And it is so true.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Because it depends on the body
type, and the past experiences,

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and the current-day
health, and what's

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.380 align:middle line:90%
going on for each person.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So I use these structures
to help people understand

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:05.130 align:middle line:90%
where they are right now.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I do like to use Joseph
Campbell's hero's journey.

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:09.480 align:middle line:90%
I call it the sheroe's journey--

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.450 align:middle line:84%
TED Talk January,
2019 about this--

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:18.330 align:middle line:84%
about using your trauma, your
disease, your challenge in life

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that you might have thought
was very, very negative

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps unfair to uplevel
your developmental state.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you do
that-- there are developmental

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.460 align:middle line:84%
states that we
accelerate through.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.570 align:middle line:90%
And they're always hard.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to go from
one to the next.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can use the hero's
journey to understand it.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.900 align:middle line:90%
You have a call to action.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Rheumatoid arthritis
was one for me.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Then you get to either heed
the call or reject the call.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:49.063 align:middle line:84%
If I ignore it, it will
keep moving through my body.

00:47:49.063 --> 00:47:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll get worse, and worse, and
worse with twisted fingers.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.210 align:middle line:84%
I was already starting
to get them twisted,

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.660 align:middle line:84%
unless I accept the call,
heed it as something

00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.550 align:middle line:84%
that I need to go learn
some new information,

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.860 align:middle line:90%
find a mentor for that.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:90%
So I found a mentor.

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Then you get this
new information

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.140 align:middle line:84%
that is coming from
the unknown world.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about herbs, Ayurveda, yoga.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I knew nothing about therapy.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:15.437 align:middle line:90%
I'd never been to therapy.

00:48:15.437 --> 00:48:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know any of the
stuff I talk about today.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.470 align:middle line:90%
That was the unknown world.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:20.730 align:middle line:90%
You get that information.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to go
into your innermost cave

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:24.630 align:middle line:90%
and integrate it.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:29.010 align:middle line:84%
How does this fit into my life
where I am on my path today?

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Then you come out.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is what really
makes people mad.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Life will start to
offer you experiences

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.795 align:middle line:90%
where you get to practice.

00:48:35.795 --> 00:48:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Found you.

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:37.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:39.298 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And then when
you get to mastery

00:48:39.298 --> 00:48:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of that-- which means you
have to practice it over,

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:42.532 align:middle line:90%
and over, and over again.

00:48:42.532 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, you'll fail.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
you'll be successful.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:51.245 align:middle line:84%
Then you actually emerge into
your next state of development.

00:48:51.245 --> 00:48:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And you come back,
you could say,

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.200 align:middle line:84%
resurrected as an
oracle or a teacher.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And you get to share that
now with your community.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that really
makes people mad-- and this

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.520 align:middle line:84%
is what I see in my medical
practice all the time.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.350 align:middle line:90%
And I teach a lot of students.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:07.270 align:middle line:84%
They get so mad when
they have overcome,

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.912 align:middle line:84%
and they've come out
on the other end,

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and they've learned
this new stuff,

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and they've gotten to this
new developmental level.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But then they get
another call to action.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.090 align:middle line:90%
But that's the cycles of life.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:19.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it works.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.020 align:middle line:84%
We move from one
cycle to the next.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.270 align:middle line:84%

those call to actions?

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's part of life.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: This is part of life.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.048 align:middle line:84%
And if we understand--
and I always say,

00:49:29.048 --> 00:49:31.340 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest things
I've learned in this lifetime

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.920 align:middle line:84%
is that all unhappiness comes
from unmet expectations.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you expect
that that's going

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:41.790 align:middle line:84%
to happen, then when it happens,
you're not so mad about it.

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Good point.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yeah.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So I went from RA
to breast cancer.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.500 align:middle line:90%
But I'd already learned this.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.300 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, my god.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: --OK, now I
know what I need to do.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
cure it naturally.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Within a month, it was gone.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
whole other story.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:59.692 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: But I wasn't
angry about it.

00:49:59.692 --> 00:50:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't all the things
I had been with RA.

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can learn
that this is part of life,

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.660 align:middle line:84%
it's part of the
cycles of life--

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.060 align:middle line:90%
spring follows winter.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.147 align:middle line:90%

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.415 align:middle line:84%

doctors come to
me in my practice,

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.820 align:middle line:90%

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.217 align:middle line:90%

00:50:27.217 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:84%
They won't talk about it,
because they're ashamed.

they wouldn't get sick.

shop for your therapist

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.290 align:middle line:84%
the way you would
shop for shoes.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:46.515 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Try them on.

00:51:46.515 --> 00:51:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: You can't
go into a shoe store

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and say, I want a pair of tall,
over-the-knee brown boots.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you find that
you find one pair,

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:55.010 align:middle line:90%
and it pinches your toe.

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't walk out of the
shoe store without shoes

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.150 align:middle line:84%
on and say, well, shoes
don't work for me--

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.940 align:middle line:84%
which is what people
do around therapy.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to say,
OK, I have to keep looking.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.423 align:middle line:90%
I really want these boots.

00:52:05.423 --> 00:52:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
go somewhere else.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep
trying them on.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And you also have to know
that talk therapy just

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:12.190 align:middle line:90%
does not work.

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.910 align:middle line:90%
It does not work.

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:15.960 align:middle line:84%
You can do that
with a girlfriend.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is the best kind?

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:18.010 align:middle line:90%
What does work?

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Trauma
release therapy comes

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:21.590 align:middle line:90%
in several different packages.

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And each therapist that
knows that format of therapy

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is not maybe going
to be a fit for you.

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.790 align:middle line:90%
So you have to shop for it.

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:31.910 align:middle line:84%
EMDR is a really good one,
Eye Movement Desensitization

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Reprogramming.

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And I show all of the resources
for finding these people

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.270 align:middle line:90%
inside this program.

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Clinical hypnotherapy,
depending on the style,

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:90%
can be really helpful.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.507 align:middle line:84%
And then brain
spotting is another one

00:52:46.507 --> 00:52:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
haven't heard of.

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:49.010 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one, too.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.885 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is that?

00:52:49.885 --> 00:52:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: Brain
spotting was developed

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:55.940 align:middle line:84%
by a doctor named David
Grand who used to teach EMDR

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and then discovered
that he could

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:84%
do this in a different
way a little bit faster.

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It kind of speeds
it up a little bit.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Huh, brain spotting.

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And people are
really worried about

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:05.025 align:middle line:84%
go to therapy,
because they think

00:53:05.025 --> 00:53:07.540 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have to
relive the darkest experiences

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.340 align:middle line:90%
of their lives.

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's not accurate.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's releasing it.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: It's
rewiring your brain,

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.710 align:middle line:84%
getting a nice bridge between
your adult brain and your child

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.390 align:middle line:90%
brain, reframing.

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole trauma
release piece.

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't happen
with talk therapy.

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the You
Unbroken program

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:27.440 align:middle line:90%
is really great for that.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love it.

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And then we've got all
kinds of things on our website

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.580 align:middle line:90%
for how to access me.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And I work with
people one-to-one,

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and in group settings,
and retreat settings

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.160 align:middle line:90%
doing trauma healing.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So one last question
I just want to ask you.

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:42.890 align:middle line:84%
What is a healthy
sexual relationship?

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:44.330 align:middle line:90%
I know you get asked this a lot.

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yeah.

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It's such a good
question, because--

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:49.290 align:middle line:84%
you're going to hear me
say the same thing again--

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.960 align:middle line:90%
it depends.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.210 align:middle line:84%
A healthy sexual
relationship is going

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:55.500 align:middle line:84%
to be one where there's
healthy communication.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So I always say that
really fantastic,

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.560 align:middle line:84%
scrape-you-off-the-walls sex
comes from really fantastic

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.930 align:middle line:84%
scrape-you-off-the-walls
communication.

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Women tend to really want their
partner to read their minds.

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.470 align:middle line:90%
They really say--

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I hear this all the time--

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:11.590 align:middle line:84%
well, if he or she
loved me, then they'd

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:13.420 align:middle line:84%
be able to know
what makes me tick.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is really
radically unfair.

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:17.890 align:middle line:90%
That is not accurate.

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have these
background experiences that

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.740 align:middle line:90%
make us who we are as adults.

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're not always
able to read minds.

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:28.330 align:middle line:90%
In fact, that's pretty unusual.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And it should not be an
expectation from your partner.

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I always tell women,
if you really want fantastic,

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:36.400 align:middle line:84%
scrape-you-off-the-wall
sex with a partner,

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.980 align:middle line:84%
then that means you have to
be able to know your own body

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.940 align:middle line:84%
first and communicate how to
get around that body for someone

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:43.970 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And so that means being able
to ask for what you want.

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes, and receive.

00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: And that's, oftentimes,
a big barrier for women--

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:53.870 align:middle line:84%
is receiving, and saying,
and articulating specifically

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:54.670 align:middle line:90%
what they want.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, rather
than just pleasing.

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Right, exactly.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is there
another way to--

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:04.210 align:middle line:84%
you say, what's in your
head is in your bed.

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to do it with
couples therapy, as well?

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.293 align:middle line:90%
Do you suggest that?

00:55:07.293 --> 00:55:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Or you just really think
working on yourself is the best?

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EWERS: No, what's in your
head does go to your bud.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And I will work with
a single person--

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean
non-partner, but I mean

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.910 align:middle line:84%
an individual in my
practice for a little while.

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll start seeing,
it's always a systems problem.

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.460 align:middle line:84%
If a child is having a
problem and needs therapy,

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.280 align:middle line:90%
it's a systems problem.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a dynamic--

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Big picture.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.808 align:middle line:10%
>>EWERS: --inside the couple.

00:55:29.808 --> 00:55:32.780 align:middle line:10%
If one of them is having an
issue, it's a systems problem.

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.420 align:middle line:10%
And so then I always,
at some point,

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:36.340 align:middle line:10%
pull the couple together.

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.470 align:middle line:90%
And we start working on that.

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And then usually,
this other individual

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.760 align:middle line:90%
has to do some work, too.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.430 align:middle line:84%
In order to uplevel,
you've got to tear apart

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:47.380 align:middle line:84%
the scaffolding and
the foundation that

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.795 align:middle line:90%
didn't work, and rebuild it.

00:55:48.795 --> 00:55:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And cover it.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EWERS: Yeah.

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:51.425 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I always
asked my guests,

00:55:51.425 --> 00:55:53.870 align:middle line:84%
what is the biggest
reason you do what you do?

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:55.496 align:middle line:90%
What's your biggest why?

00:55:55.496 --> 00:56:00.640 align:middle line:10%
>>EWERS: Oh, my why is really
helping people attain freedom

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:05.890 align:middle line:10%
from these old, really
needing-to-be-deleted belief

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:10%
systems that are running them
from a place where their brains

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:13.090 align:middle line:10%
weren't fully developed, and
they made up these stories.

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
attracting people to them

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.050 align:middle line:84%
that have the script
in their hands

00:56:17.050 --> 00:56:18.970 align:middle line:90%
to live that same story out.

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So my why is to have
everyone attain freedom.

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is my desire, too--

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that we would live
without trauma.

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:28.690 align:middle line:84%
What a life of
freedom that would be.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:29.740 align:middle line:90%
