>>LISA GARR: What is one of
the most important things that

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:84%
can help us in a time of
need, crisis, or loneliness,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that also can bring happiness,
celebration, and joy?

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.042 align:middle line:90%
It's community.

00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing
that we can rely

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
on that has lasted
generation after generation.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, and joining me is
poet and philosopher Mark Nepo.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:10%
He is a "New York
Times" bestselling

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:10%
author of over 20
books, including

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:10%
"The Book of Awakening."

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
He's appeared on "Oprah"
and "SuperSoul Sunday"

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
many times, sharing his
deep spiritual wisdom.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:10%
And for his latest book, he's
got "More Together Than Alone."

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Mark has spent 13
years gathering stories

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
from diverse
cultures and history

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
to prove that we are
more together than alone.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.911 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK NEPO: Oh, it's a joy
to be with you, absolutely.

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: The timeliness of
this book is incredible,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:10%
yet you've spent 13 years
researching this topic.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.580 align:middle line:10%
You know, the timing that
it's done is way beyond me.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I started this, as
you said, many years ago,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:10%
and I was really interested
in gathering stories

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:10%
that would lift up and
affirm the lineage of care

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:10%
and interdependence.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:10%
And I wasn't looking to
create a social theory

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:10%
or have anything be academic.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:10%
I simply wanted
stories of moments

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:10%
when we've worked well together
and the lessons, because that's

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:10%
a lineage too.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I was just working
like a little worker bee,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually,
of all my books--

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
because it was so vast,
it can't be definitive.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just what I was able
to glean with my heart lens,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:90%
bring together, and learn from.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But it was the only book
that, in the middle of it,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I wondered, will I be
able to finish this?

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I was so deep in the midst
of all of the stories and all

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
the research, and then I
saw, you know, a way through,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and yeah.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.364 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I was clear that I could.

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I understand what
you're talking about,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
because when I started the
book, you so beautifully lay out

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
everywhere community
is in nature.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Through the forest floor
and the cells of our body,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:90%
it is everywhere.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
When you start to see
it, it is everywhere.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: It is everywhere,
and it helps--

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and you know, it's
very interesting to me,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and a great example which
is early in the book

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:90%
is aspen groves.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:90%
And you know, aspens--

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of people know
this, but an aspen grove

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle line:90%
can be hundreds of square miles.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's
unique about them

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
is that above ground,
they're individual trees,

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
but below ground, they
share one root system.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's a perfect metaphor
for community throughout time

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
because we are, at
once, individuals.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:90%
We're sitting here.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:90%
We're not physically connected.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But under ground, that is in
the invisible foundational world

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
of spirit, we have
one root system.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And so beyond altruism, beyond
the virtues of kindness,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
we have to care about
each other's roots.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm
diseased, you have

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:84%
to care because
it's your roots too.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So we are wired to care about
each other and our well-being.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what I
also got out of that,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and when you said
the whole forest

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
could burn down, that
the community will

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
rise it back up again and grow
the aspens out of the ashes.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is so exactly
what we're going

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.605 align:middle line:90%
through in our world today.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, it's very
powerful right now.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the things that
I've learned and looked at,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, with everything that's
happening, not just in America,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.625 align:middle line:90%
but also globally--

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Globally.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Globally.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've looked throughout time
with this lens through history,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
so I react in my own
individual personhood.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So in our time, you know, while
I'm a student of all paths,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm of Jewish heritage.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I had people in my
grandparents' generation

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:90%
die in the Holocaust.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in 2018
and we're in America,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and when would I ever think
that we would see Nazis

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:90%
in the streets of America?

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So how am I, as a
person in a family here,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
how do I deal with
that while it's

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:90%
frightening and outrageous?

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And then as I look
from all this research,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and as a spirit in
this lineage, so then I

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
tried to look back through
time and say, well,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:90%
What's the pattern?

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, like
waves in the ocean that

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
go into their belly
and then they crest

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and into their belly, there
have been periods repeatedly

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:84%
throughout history where
we push each other away

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and where we come together,
where we push each other away

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and where we come together.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And so much of it has to do with
whether love or fear governs

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it made me-- you know,
one of the chapters in the book

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
is called "The Two
Tribes," so I want

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:84%
to tell this kind
of imagined parable

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
because it really holds a deep
insight for me that I think

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:90%
is relevant today.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So imagine back in cave times,
the first two people who

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.004 align:middle line:90%
discovered they weren't alone.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, one person comes
to the mouth of the cave,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:84%
sees someone in there
and goes, oh, wait, whoa.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was all alone.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine that the person
in the cave looks and says, oh.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:90%
You're different, go away.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.206 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was the
beginning of the go away tribe.

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm different than you.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: You're
different, go away.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And based on whatever level
of fear we wake up with,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:84%
now if that gets--
throughout history,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
when we've had periods where
that fear has gotten greater,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
then it's like, well I
can't trust you'll go away.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I have to put you
where I can watch you,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
so I'll put you in a
camp or a refugee center

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
or a detention
center or a ghetto.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And make
you feel less than.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Less than.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:90%
Less than.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And the other person at the
mouth of the cave looking in,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
seeing another, said oh, you're
different, come teach me.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of the come teach me tribe.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That takes a certain
amount of evolution though.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
That first tribe is a very
survivalistic separatism

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:84%
type of tribe, and that
still exists very much today.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, this is
the catch, if you will,

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
in this imagined parable,
because on the that side

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
of the come teach me tribe,
of which Plato was a part--

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Plato said we are
born whole, W-H-O-L-E,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
but we need each
other to be complete.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.489 align:middle line:84%
And at the greatest belief
that we need each other,

00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that we are more
together than alone,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.540 align:middle line:84%
we've had the greatest
periods of enlightenment

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and civilisation.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But the catch is that we
belong to both tribes.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.760 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Now you've visited
many, many cultures.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.730 align:middle line:84%
When you went through
your exploration,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:90%
what did you start to find?

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.595 align:middle line:84%
What sparked your interest
in this in the first place?

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:17.979 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, in
the first place,

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
it actually goes back
to my cancer journey,

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:84%
though I didn't
know it at the time.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was in those
treatment rooms and waiting

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
rooms, it was a
moment of community.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.585 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people
that I was closest to,

00:08:30.585 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know, to
this day, their last names,

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:90%
where they lived, what they did.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:84%
But we were thrown
into this raft

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:84%
of a waiting room,
of a treatment

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:84%
room in the sea of cancer,
and all of a sudden,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:90%
we're saying hi, how are you?

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And there was this bond where we
were more together than alone.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think years
later, it led me

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:90%
to start to want to find this--

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
there have to be other
places and other things.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And actually, you know,
I dedicate this book

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:84%
to Howard Zinn, the
great historian.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know him
personally long,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:10%
but toward the
end of his life, I

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:10%
was blessed to know
him for a while,

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:10%
and even in that short time,
he was a great teacher.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.574 align:middle line:84%
And I was working on this
and I asked him about this.

00:09:15.574 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, I said,
well what do you

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
think about this, about
these moments of community?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.367 align:middle line:90%
Do you think this is possible?

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said the most
remarkable thing.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:90%
He said oh, absolutely.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
He said if you consider when
the Wright brothers flew

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
the first plane, it was only
in the air for 27 seconds,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
but everyone knew it
was a matter of time.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And he said,
why not with community?

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
If we have these short moments
when we are our better angels

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and we are our authentic selves
and we care for each other,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
it's just a matter
of time before we

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.020 align:middle line:84%
have a beloved community as
Martin Luther King talked

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hm.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
If that is the
purpose of the book,

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:84%
is to really show how we are
better together and stronger

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:84%
together than we are
alone, how much of America,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
or I would say the
globe, do you see

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
as sided on the alone
and divisiveness

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:90%
or on the togetherness?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, I
think it's unclear

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
right now which
way this is going.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say
that is certainly--

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I agree.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: --is because
the divisiveness,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:90%
the fear, the violence.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
When things fall apart--

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:90%
this is like spiritual physics.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:84%
When things fall apart
in nature and humanity,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:90%
they make a lot of noise.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:90%
When things come together--

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and they were always at the
same time, things falling apart

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and things coming together--

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:90%
they're quieter.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So right now, it's
unclear which way

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
it's tipping, though
there are definitely

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
large factions around the world
that are really taking root

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.080 align:middle line:84%
in the go away tribe right
now, in the fear-based tribe,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.819 align:middle line:84%
and they're making
a lot of noise.

00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It gets a lot of press.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well I think
in the modern world,

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.500 align:middle line:84%
we're addicted to the noise
of things falling apart.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Of course,
it's the whole dopamine

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:84%
center of the brain that fear
and negativity stimulates,

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and that gives people
a sense of survival.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
But this idea about
community and peace, it

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:90%
isn't as stimulating.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:90%
It isn't as newsworthy.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:90%
This

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: This is one of the
roles throughout history

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:90%
of suffering.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
All these traditions speak
about it differently.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't sign up.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants suffering.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But suffering is to humanity
what erosion is to nature.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Erosion makes the
mountains beautiful,

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and suffering wears away
everything that's extraneous.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that whatever

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
has created all of this,
whatever name you give

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
to it, that mystery has made
life just difficult enough

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
that we need each other, I think
to ensure the journey of love.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.173 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:12:09.173 --> 00:12:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
it's so interesting

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that there's been studies done
about philanthropy and giving,

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's so clear that people
who have less give more.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
assumed reasons or one

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:84%
of the anecdotes
in the stories is

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
because through suffering opens
and deepens our compassion.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.496 align:middle line:84%
So if I know what
it is not to have--

00:12:39.496 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: One of my
personal family stories,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:84%
it's a mythology in my
family of my grandfather

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
who, in the Great Depression in
Brooklyn, they were immigrants.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Came over from Russia, had
nothing, were out of work.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather
and our family history

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.625 align:middle line:84%
was he would bring
strangers home to dinner.

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And my grandmother
would take him aside

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.120 align:middle line:90%
and go, what are you doing?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.974 align:middle line:84%
We don't have-- what
are we going to do?

00:13:04.974 --> 00:13:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather would
kiss her on the cheek

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and say, break whatever
we have in half.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.645 align:middle line:90%
It'll be enough.

00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Really, this is it
you were raised with?

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's wonderful.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Well you've had quite the
journey through cancer

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:90%
and through your 20 books.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
You went on a wonderful tour
with Oprah who looks just

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle line:90%
like an incredible person.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.100 align:middle line:90%

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is she incredible?

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: You talk
about authenticity,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:90%
she is what you see.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
She is authentic and generous
and a real bridger, you know.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.705 align:middle line:84%
She just brings so many
people together constantly.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:43.705 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

>>NEPO: Well and I
think that, you know,

00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:84%
you look at her show through all
those years and in the work she

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
still does with "SuperSoul
Sunday" and the OWN channel,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
but you look at the heart
of what she did, is she,

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:84%
for 25 years and
continuing, has taken--

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
whether it's 200 men who've
been sexually abused,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's--

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Divided America.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Right.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:84%
She has made these difficult
things public and intimate

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
to say, let's look at
the truth of our lives.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's bear witness,
and then as soon

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
as we do that, we find
we are each other.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like you've
seen multiple times

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:90%
in creating this book.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us other
stories of where

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.880 align:middle line:84%
you've seen this wonderful type
of community and togetherness

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:90%
heal and solve divisiveness.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Oh, there's several.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Let me try to give
a few from way back.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the
second century BC,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
there was what was known
as the Gandhara Empire,

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and it was in what was
ancient Persia, which

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:84%
is now in the Middle East,
probably around Pakistan.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the first where

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.429 align:middle line:84%
the singularity
or the nationalism

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that we are experiencing
today, where

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
all the different traditions
were kind of holing up.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:84%
This empire, this
Gandhara Empire

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
was the first cross-cultural
empire that not only welcomed

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
all the different Greek
and early Buddhist

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and early Christian
and pre-Christian.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
They created a university called
Taxila, and this university had

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.950 align:middle line:84%
like 10,000 students that
were brought from all

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:84%
over this empire,
and it was based

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
on that you had to learn
all the traditions.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And they literally had
64 to 80 different things

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:90%
you could study.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything from astronomy
to divining water,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
but they had
dormitories where you

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.790 align:middle line:84%
had to live with your teacher,
like about 500 students to one

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
teacher, and you
had to take courses

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:90%
in all different traditions.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What happened
though, Mark?

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, what happened
is those waves crest.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the things is that
communities don't last forever,

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:84%
but they leave their wisdom and
their greatest gifts forever.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But the gifts and lessons
from that community,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
while that actual
community was dispersed,

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:34.210 align:middle line:84%
has gone on to fuel this
lineage of civilization.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Now if we move further into
more contemporary times, Rwanda.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And we know in 1994, the
horrible genocide in Rwanda.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And this I know because
there was, believe it or not,

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:84%
one psychiatrist native to
Rwanda when this all happened.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:90%
They tried talking circles.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.330 align:middle line:90%
They tried forgiveness circles.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was so raw and so
fresh, it didn't work.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And what they tried, finally,
this psychiatrist, they devised

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and they got a grant from
the Templeton Foundation

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:90%
to help fund this.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They did seed grants
for businesses, farms,

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:84%
for things that would help
these people regain their lives.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:10%
But the one
requirement was it had

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:10%
to be a Hutu and Tutsi
working together.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:10%
That's practical.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
See, that makes a lot of
sense and you bring it

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.867 align:middle line:90%
into the practical.

00:17:28.867 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And it is interesting that the
healing circles and the talking

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
circles didn't necessarily work.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Well it was too raw.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.213 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, in the beginning.

00:17:35.213 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So what happened
was, begrudgingly

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
to help each other, they
would work together--

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and they chronicled
these cases-- they

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.150 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't talk to each other.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:84%
But then eventually,
building something together,

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.810 align:middle line:84%
a Hutu would drop a
hammer from a ladder

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:90%
and a Tutsi would, here.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's a big deal.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a big deal.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of history there.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And they would
start to work together.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.438 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Don't you think
ultimately, Mark, that people

00:17:58.438 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
just want to belong
to something,

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.250 align:middle line:84%
something greater
than themselves?

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Absolutely.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you know, we go back
to nature and our ability,

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.090 align:middle line:84%
our need, our yearning to
join is imprinted in our DNA.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
That if you take two
living heart cells

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and put them in a Petri
dish and walk away,

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and you come back
in the next day,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
they will have found a
third and common beat.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NEPO: And they have found--

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:10%
the doctor Ervin Laszlo,
who is a physicist,

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:10%
he did experiments
with meditators,

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:10%
having people meditate, and
a similar thing happened.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:10%
If you and I were the
subjects in this experiment

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:10%
and we came in and
we meditated quietly

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.220 align:middle line:10%
and they were tracking
our brainwaves,

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:10%
after an hour or
so, our brainwaves

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.775 align:middle line:10%
would started to meditate
to a common third wave.

00:18:59.775 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: A combination
of the two.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And then if you
introduced a stranger,

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:84%
he found, like if then
you asked me to leave

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and brought a third person in,
very quickly, this third person

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%
would start to meditate
their brain to the wave

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.745 align:middle line:90%
that we had found.

00:19:16.745 --> 00:19:18.019 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's coherence.

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:18.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Its coherence.

00:19:18.935 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So community
builds coherence.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well and what I feel is
that it's proof that intimacy

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:90%
is what leads us to oneness.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at something
as devastating as the Holocaust,

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and now you have second and
third generation of Holocaust

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
survivors that are starting
to heal this conversation,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
going back to Germany and having
open circles and conversations,

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:90%
and they're incredible.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And it is working.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take a while
because it's still so raw.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I think
that this is so powerful,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
these terrible moments, the long
moments of these atrocities.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we
learn from the Holocaust

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and from Apartheid, from
Rwanda, from all these,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:84%
the things that have
come out of that,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.450 align:middle line:84%
like the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa, they have taken
the basic notion of bearing

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
witness, telling the
truth of our experience,

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and allowing us to
make amends and repair,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and that that can't happen
unless it's done in public.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is why we're
at this tipping point

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and why it's so important for us
to have this conversation now.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.165 align:middle line:84%
We really can make
this decision.

00:20:52.165 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look
at this great video where

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:59.061 align:middle line:84%
Mark is talking about that we
are more together than alone.

00:20:59.061 --> 00:21:01.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NEPO: I'm really
exploring the power

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:10%
and the history of community.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:10%
That is, moments throughout time
and across all cultures when

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:10%
we've worked well together.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:10%
And it's taken me 13 years to
explore and work on this book,

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:10%
never having any idea
that I would finish it

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:10%
at a time in our world when
we are really being stretched

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:10%
by discord and fear.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:10%
But one repeating theme,
one repeating insight that

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:10%
seems to be in almost every
story in every culture

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:10%
is that when fear makes us think
that self interest will protect

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:10%
us, love and suffering
reaffirm for us

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:10%
and help us rediscover
that we are, in fact, more

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:10%
together than alone.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.880 align:middle line:10%
And so, repeatedly, even
though when things are always

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:10%
breaking apart around
us, the quiet courage

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:10%
that's always very
close to every one of us

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:10%
is that, when we
reach out together,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:10%
that's actually
what protects us.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.902 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:05.902 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So in this
video, it talked

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:84%
about how when we reach
out in a time of need,

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:90%
it brings us together more.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
In a time of survival or how a
community bringing us together

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:84%
can actually protect us against
the elements or the enemy.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this a lot
with natural disasters.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're up against
mother nature

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and a community gets
devastated, and yet they

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.727 align:middle line:84%
build their infrastructure
even tighter over the years.

00:22:36.727 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NEPO: Well it's interesting
that, on a personal level,

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:10%
and I think on a
community level--

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:10%
you know, I learned in my
work with my other books

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.700 align:middle line:10%
that on a personal
level, there are two ways

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:10%
that human beings mostly grow.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:10%
One is by willfully shedding
what no longer works,

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:10%
and the other is
we're broken open.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.540 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have to choose.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Like X and Y chromosomes,
we are made up

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:84%
of different
combinations of both.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.565 align:middle line:84%
We will willfully shed some
things, and what we resist--

00:23:09.565 --> 00:23:10.365 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Persists.

00:23:10.365 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: --will be broken open.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:84%
There's an old Roman
saying that the fates lead

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:90%
those who are willing.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.367 align:middle line:90%
Those who won't, they drag.

00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So this has been
going on a long time,

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
but it also, I think,
applies communally.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
That in these moments
of great disasters,

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and no one again-- this is like
we're describing like gravity.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.300 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying go
out and find disasters.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Things happen.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And in those moments,
everything that we thought

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
was a requirement to behold
each other is washed away,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:90%
is broken open.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:49.724 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:50.523 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:23:50.523 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
We let go of the old
ways of doing things.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And now we
have to be there.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And I also think why
this is so important is--

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and this is, again, a medical
or a biological metaphor--

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:84%
but if we look at
humanity as a global body,

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and every soul is a
cell in that body--

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
well, a body is
considered healthy

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
if it has one more
healthy cell than toxic.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.550 align:middle line:84%
You'd like a lot more, but
it's considered healthy

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
as long as there's
one more healthy cell.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is why every
single thing, including

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
our conversation or
the conversations

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:84%
you have on your
show, the moments when

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
we are in those disasters
helping each other,

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well, what
could saving one dog or one

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:90%
grandmother on a porch do?

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Well every single
act can help us

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.210 align:middle line:84%
ensure that we're strengthening
the immune system of humanity,

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.965 align:middle line:84%
that there is one
more healthy soul--

00:24:52.965 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Healthy cell.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: --cell than toxic.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why every act
in conversation of kindness

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:90%
matters.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: One more healthy soul.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:84%
That's all we need to be, is
that one more healthy soul.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:84%
In terms of community and
being stronger together,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
about technology?

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Does it bring us together,
or does it divide us?

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well I think both,
so let's talk for a second.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I love technology and I
wouldn't want to give it up,

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:84%
but that's because it's
a tool that serves this.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't substitute for this
human, present, real contact.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It shouldn't.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: No, it shouldn't.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
But what happens, I believe,
in our modern world,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.020 align:middle line:90%
is that technology is inert.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have values.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:90%
It's something to use.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:58.595 align:middle line:84%
But if you and I are not
being present, fully alive--

00:25:58.595 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have to
have things figured out,

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.300 align:middle line:84%
but if we're not pursuing
an inner life about what

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
it means to be a here, then
the way water will fill

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
in any hole, the
characteristics of technology

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:90%
will become our default values.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Give me an example.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, so you know,
the value of being present

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.082 align:middle line:84%
and authentic is that
we are where we are.

00:26:25.082 --> 00:26:25.915 align:middle line:90%
We're in the moment.

00:26:25.915 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: We're not
running off over here.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we're not
present, then what

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:84%
are the characteristics
of technology?

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:90%
It's fast.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
You're in more than one
place at the same time,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.615 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to make us
feel like life is over there.

00:26:40.615 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or is there
something better over there?

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:90%
So it could serve both--

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well this is the
good thing about technology,

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I feel it's an amazing
educational tool.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's also what I would
call an information commons.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Now the notion of the
commons, which is something

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen throughout
the history of community,

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is the commons are
considered, way back,

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:84%
common land or resources that
we depend on, but nobody owns.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So a great example in Mongolia,
the shepherds who depend--

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
their herds of sheep depend
on these vast grasslands

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:90%
that no one can own.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And they have their little
farms and their little homes

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and their little
huts, but they have

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to care for those common
grasslands that nobody owns.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Another is fishermen
in the ocean.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Nobody owns the
water, but you have

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.760 align:middle line:84%
to care for it so that
they can get the fish

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:90%
to feed their families.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think about
commons, we extend that.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The commons are things
like knowledge and things

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.075 align:middle line:90%
we care about.

00:28:01.075 --> 00:28:03.033 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well you were
talking about the oceans.

00:28:03.033 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have this huge
issue with our oceans

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:09.250 align:middle line:84%
now in terms of radiation
and toxicity and plastics.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.697 align:middle line:84%
But yet, what's happening
is the gathering together

00:28:11.697 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of these environmental
communities that are really

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
raising the awareness
about this or else I

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:90%
couldn't speak about it now.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not out there in
the middle of the ocean,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.793 align:middle line:90%
but I've heard so much about it.

00:28:19.793 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So isn't contrast
healthy in a way, Mark?

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it create good?

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, I would want to
discern that a little further.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Contrast can be
healthy, but not always.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But I think
diversity is healthy.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:90%
That is, we need difference.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.345 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's interesting.

00:28:37.345 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: In other words, I
don't think we need to choose

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:41.899 align:middle line:90%
between--

00:28:41.899 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:84%
this is invoked from
a different tradition,

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:90%
the Native American tradition.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Their elder counsels have
always, and still today,

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.400 align:middle line:90%
meet in circle.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.500 align:middle line:84%
They all meet in a circle,
not just for equity

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
head to the circle,

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:84%
they meet in circle
so that everyone has

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.340 align:middle line:90%
a direct view of the center.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.425 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I like that too, yes.

00:29:02.425 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Because what
is inherent in that,

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
the assumption is we
need everybody's view

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:90%
to understand the center.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:90%
No one view will do it.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So right away, forget
argument, forget debate,

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:90%
forget persuasion.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.380 align:middle line:90%
We gather meaning.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.280 align:middle line:90%
We don't choose it.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Meaning is not seesaw.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:90%
You're up, therefore I am down.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:90%
We do gather it.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And this is what's
the value of diversity.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do is
look at nature, spring.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:84%
This is another great example
of community and diversity.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Every spring, thousands
of insects and birds,

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
each are born to pollinate a
particular and different plant,

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:90%
shrub, fruit, or flower.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They have a purpose.

00:29:52.275 --> 00:29:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So suppose
the bees come along

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.220 align:middle line:90%
and were fundamentalist bees.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:84%
We're all going
to do it our way.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:90%
There'd be no spring.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's true.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.598 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: There'd be no spring.

00:30:05.598 --> 00:30:11.020 align:middle line:90%
We need every possible path.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And I believe even in
religious traditions,

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that's why there are so many
traditions, because no two

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.540 align:middle line:84%
people will be pollinated
spiritually the same way.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you're saying
different religions,

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:84%
different belief systems
are all a part of it?

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Including atheists.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, it all has to
be that way in order for us

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:90%
to cooperate.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.937 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Because the
whole is greater

00:30:35.937 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:90%
than the sum of the parts.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Because like that elder circle,
we need everybody's view.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:90%
We need to add--

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.590 align:middle line:84%
so I need to say that we
come back to come teach me.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're different.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.800 align:middle line:84%
You're on the other
side of the circle.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Don't go away.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.142 align:middle line:84%
Come teach me what I don't
know, what I can't see.

00:30:51.142 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just like a team
or a work environment,

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:84%
everybody brings
their skill sets

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and makes up a common
whole, makes up

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.740 align:middle line:90%
the common greater good.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So this brings
us to what prevents that,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:90%
what stops us traditionally?

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.397 align:middle line:84%
And this, again,
is like any day.

00:31:05.397 --> 00:31:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about this
now, but if I wake up

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.650 align:middle line:84%
afraid enough or unworthy enough
or insecure enough tomorrow,

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to need you to
remind me that, oh, no.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.930 align:middle line:84%
We belong to the
come teach me tribe.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But so one of the things that is
very human, but we need to help

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:90%
guard each other.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And this comes
from Robert Keegan

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.490 align:middle line:10%
is a developmental
psychologist at Harvard.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:29.550 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that's
brilliant that he has done

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:34.950 align:middle line:10%
is he defined centrism, like
egocentrism or ethnocentrism,

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:38.760 align:middle line:10%
any kind of centrism where
you are self-centered.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:44.437 align:middle line:84%
He defined it as when we mistake
what is familiar as true.

00:31:44.437 --> 00:31:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Give me an example of that.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: So it's the one
in the cave who says,

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:90%
you're different, go away.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I only want to
confirm what I already know.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I want to talk
to you because I

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
want to affirm that
the way I see things--

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:90%
oh, you see it the same way.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.442 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that must be true.

00:32:07.442 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we must
be in the same tribe.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.460 align:middle line:84%

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Is a lie.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.990 align:middle line:90%

>>LISA: Right, right.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: That's
dangerous and we're

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:84%
seeing that seeded today in
America and around the world.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Then when we're
secure enough, we

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:84%
can say, thank
god you're not me.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.109 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what I don't know.

00:32:32.109 --> 00:32:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Tell me something I don't know.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Tell me something I've never
heard of before so I can grow.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I think that's great,
except we live in a world

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.460 align:middle line:90%
today of fake news and lies.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.105 align:middle line:84%
So how do we discern what
we need to learn from those?

00:32:46.105 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, I think that every
human being has an authenticity

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.640 align:middle line:84%
barometer which
is our open heart.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot more
tools and technology,

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's no different than
back in those cave times.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:84%
If we trust our heart, we
will discover that we're

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.550 align:middle line:90%
more together than alone.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I believe is
that truth is truth,

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have to meet
bullying and falseness

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:90%
with bullying and falseness.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:84%
We need to meet it
with authenticity.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:84%
We need to stay grounded in
the truth and kindness that has

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.900 align:middle line:90%
a longer and larger lineage.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, I'm sure you've
done this over the last 13

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.820 align:middle line:84%
years where you've
taken this concept,

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.070 align:middle line:84%
we're more together

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:90%

be challenged,

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.880 align:middle line:84%

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have any answers.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I struggle with it.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.420 align:middle line:90%

>>NEPO: I worry about it.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think also, the
paradox under that

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
is even when I look at the
TV and I get all excited

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and worked up and feel like
how can this be happening,

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.020 align:middle line:90%
we are they.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:90%
There is no they.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I think we can see--

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:38.920 align:middle line:84%
so in Sierra Leone in the 90s,
after another brutal civil war

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that was for 10, 15
years right in villages,

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.780 align:middle line:84%
they created a thing
called Fambul Tok, which

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:90%
means family talk.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And they brought people
together in a circle,

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
man with one arm,

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and they said, how
did you lose your arm?

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I lost it in the civil war.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Who cut off your arm?

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:90%
He did, across the circle.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
long terrible silence,

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and then the person who did it
came over and started crying,

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.855 align:middle line:84%
and sat before the other man
and said I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:35:19.855 --> 00:35:22.740 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I think we can't underestimate
the power of truth

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and the power of
the human heart.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge, individually,
and I think, in community,

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:41.220 align:middle line:84%
is that the things that are
difficult in life, pain, fear,

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.240 align:middle line:84%
violence, desperation,
grief, loss, they all

all until we stop the noise,

until we go below
the noise, until we

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.470 align:middle line:84%
go below the habit
of our own thoughts.

still and quiet all the time.

As a whale or dolphin
must break surface only

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.950 align:middle line:84%

break surface again, each of us

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.340 align:middle line:84%
must break surface into
the noise of the world only

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:84%

identify one quality

And what was the
other part of it?

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.520 align:middle line:90%
That no one can--

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: That no one gave you

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and immediately,
the answer that came up in me

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:84%
is my ability to always see
the highest good in someone.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It's my innate--
and for a long time,

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.710 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of
Pollyanna-ish that I always

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:90%
saw the good in people.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.260 align:middle line:90%
I was fairly naive.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.060 align:middle line:90%
But now, I see why it's serving.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.930 align:middle line:84%
How it's serving is that I
see the gift in what people

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:84%
have to offer humanity, and
it's why I do what I do.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's such
a great question.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you suggest people to do
this in a community circle,

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.100 align:middle line:90%
or how do people work with that?

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Yeah, I do.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I do suggest people
to journal about it.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I offer that
is, you know, certainly, we

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:90%
can learn from others.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But you know, traditionally,
the shadow of being taught

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:27.880 align:middle line:84%
is that you are imposed
with someone else's values.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the shadow part.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But we always can learn
from other people.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.045 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow of just only
trusting your own experience

00:39:34.045 --> 00:39:35.795 align:middle line:84%
is that you're only
listening to yourself.

00:39:35.795 --> 00:39:36.794 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ignorance, yeah.

00:39:36.794 --> 00:39:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: But so I offer
this as a way for people

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to get in touch with
their true nature.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is born just
like those two heart cells

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.840 align:middle line:90%
that will find each other.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is born with
an innate gift that

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.380 align:middle line:84%
may manifest differently,
but at heart,

00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:84%
is the electricity of
aliveness that I believe

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.670 align:middle line:84%
is manifest as
goodness in the world.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So I invite people to think
about, what were you born with?

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.390 align:middle line:84%
One thing, and it could be as
simple is your ability to smile

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.210 align:middle line:84%
or your ability to
laugh, you know.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I think, for me--

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I want to ask you.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:16.660 align:middle line:90%
What is yours?

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Well I think two things.

00:40:17.993 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I think, for me, I just
have this unbreakable belief

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.720 align:middle line:84%
in the heart as our
strongest muscle,

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:90%
as our greatest teacher.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can tell you
that in my lifetime, 67,

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.550 align:middle line:84%
but there is a constellation
of times in my life

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.140 align:middle line:84%
where, everyone
goes through this,

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.100 align:middle line:90%
where my heart was shattered.

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And I never thought
in each of those times

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.432 align:middle line:84%
that I could ever be
put back together.

00:40:43.432 --> 00:40:45.265 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Especially with
your cancer journey.

00:40:45.265 --> 00:40:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Especially
with my cancer journey.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.609 align:middle line:90%
And yet, at least so far--

00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:51.150 align:middle line:84%
maybe next time it
will be different,

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.810 align:middle line:84%
but so far, I can
say to you today,

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:59.440 align:middle line:84%
every time, not only was
my heart put back together,

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
but it was larger, stronger,
more sensitive, more gentle,

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:90%
and more loving.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that how
you live your life

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:90%
in a state of remission?

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well I would say
yes, but I would even

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.620 align:middle line:90%
take away the word remission.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like-- you
know, it's interesting,

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and I talk about
this in the book,

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that in the legal view of
life from the beginning

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of civilization and
community, you're

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:90%
innocent until proven guilty.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the medical world,
you're sick until proven well.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So even the word
remission is a presumption

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.860 align:middle line:90%
that you're on borrowed time.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.996 align:middle line:90%
You're sick.

00:41:39.996 --> 00:41:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You happen to be
well, but you're

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.490 align:middle line:90%
really sick when nobody knows.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:45.715 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:41:45.715 --> 00:41:47.340 align:middle line:84%
We could walk out
and get hit by a bus.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows
anything, so it really

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.960 align:middle line:90%
is a toxic way of holding it.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So I say that I'm
always healing.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.030 align:middle line:90%
I never say I'm healed.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a constant
state of healing.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Yes, which I
think is for everyone.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the things that
we learn in difficult times,

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:08.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's as a
community or an individual,

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:84%
the lessons are
graphic, but they apply

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.860 align:middle line:90%
to everyone in ordinary times.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They can, yes.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.650 align:middle line:84%
As I said, some of my
greatest weaknesses

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.720 align:middle line:84%
end up being my greatest
strengths in the long run.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Individually, that
happens, but does that also

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:27.890 align:middle line:90%
happen for a community?

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.759 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, I think
one of the things--

00:42:29.759 --> 00:42:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
diversity before.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think just like
each person has a gift,

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.460 align:middle line:84%
each culture has a
gift which I've seen

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.540 align:middle line:90%
as doing all this research.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And just like when I made the
analogy to nature and spring,

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.200 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to choose
between cultures.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.470 align:middle line:84%
We need the strengths
of each culture.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, in
the West, in America,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.200 align:middle line:90%
you know, self-reliance.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Self-reliance, independence
has been the great-- you know,

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.320 align:middle line:84%
the understanding and pursuit
of a self in the West has been

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and the shadow of that
is self-centeredness,

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.420 align:middle line:84%
which has become
maybe the greatest

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.360 align:middle line:84%
modern psychological
disease we have.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's not by chance that
when you look at cancer,

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:21.910 align:middle line:84%
where the cell is
so self-centered--

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:22.995 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It just eats.

00:43:22.995 --> 00:43:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: --it will
eat everything,

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:90%
including the whole.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.970 align:middle line:90%
The part will live.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:33.550 align:middle line:84%
The whole dies at the expense
of the self-centered part.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So in a way,
self-centeredness is

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:43.290 align:middle line:84%
a cancerous
psychological disease.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's come back
to that in a second,

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.090 align:middle line:84%
but in Africa, one of
the beautiful things

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.964 align:middle line:84%
throughout Africa is there is
an inherent communal sense.

00:43:50.964 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things I learned was

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.600 align:middle line:84%
that, for all the
different tribes and all

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the different
languages in Africa,

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.460 align:middle line:90%
there is no word for orphan.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Because there isn't any?

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:06.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NEPO: Because their tribe
culture in all those nations,

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:11.280 align:middle line:10%
going back indigenously,
is such an extended family

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:17.080 align:middle line:10%
that if a parent dies,
the child is assumed

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.969 align:middle line:10%
by the larger community.

00:44:18.969 --> 00:44:20.760 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: That's why the
village was created.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NEPO: There's no
need for the word.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:26.410 align:middle line:10%
But it's not by accident
that we in the West

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:30.540 align:middle line:10%
have trouble having
that sense of community,

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:35.805 align:middle line:10%
but in Africa, there's trouble
finding a sense of self.

00:44:35.805 --> 00:44:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's built in into that
community though, in Africa.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.060 align:middle line:84%
In the tribe, the
village is built in.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.730 align:middle line:84%
America was created
in a different way.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Pioneers forging
new paths, settling.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Manifest destiny, yes.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But we need the gifts of
all these different cultures

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.160 align:middle line:90%
and traditions.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, like the elders circle,
we need everybody's gifts.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to choose
or fight between them.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.612 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back to
our modern culture,

00:45:03.612 --> 00:45:05.070 align:middle line:84%
because there's
one other thing I'd

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:08.387 align:middle line:84%
like to raise which has troubled
me and troubled everybody,

00:45:08.387 --> 00:45:10.470 align:middle line:84%
but I've tried to think
about from the lens of all

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:11.430 align:middle line:90%
this research.

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's the epidemic
of mass shootings.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just going
to ask you about that.

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes, thank you.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: In our society.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's happening
around the world,

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.475 align:middle line:90%
but in America, it's insane.

00:45:20.475 --> 00:45:24.300 align:middle line:90%


00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, both
individually and communally,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.050 align:middle line:84%
every community
and individual will

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.839 align:middle line:84%
be given the chance to be
dropped into the depth of life.

00:45:34.839 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's beautiful.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: And you know,
for me, it was cancer,

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.925 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't have
to be terrible.

00:45:39.925 --> 00:45:41.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be life-threatening.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It could be beauty or wonder.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:48.030 align:middle line:84%
These young people, this
shooting dropped all of them

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:49.070 align:middle line:90%
into the depth of life.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:50.970 align:middle line:84%
They are very old
souls that have been

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.685 align:middle line:90%
forced to rawly show up now.

00:45:55.685 --> 00:45:57.874 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But what they've
done for all young people--

00:45:57.874 --> 00:45:58.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: That's fantastic.

00:45:58.915 --> 00:46:01.164 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, even my
daughter's school had walkouts

00:46:01.164 --> 00:46:06.270 align:middle line:84%
for 17 seconds or minutes of
silence for the 17 that passed.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was not school
approved, they just walked out.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And they had their moment,
and they remembered,

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and they talked about what
these kids' lives were like.

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:16.950 align:middle line:84%
They were soccer
players like them,

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.920 align:middle line:84%
they were volleyball
players, they were academics.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And these kids got
to relate to it,

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and this is all the way,
you know, across the nation.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, all
created by social media.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well this
is, again, the--

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, when social
media is in place

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:41.374 align:middle line:90%
of authentic connection--

00:46:41.374 --> 00:46:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not good.

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: It becomes toxic,
and it creates what

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I call a virtual Colosseum.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Colosseum
in ancient Rome

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:56.610 align:middle line:84%
where all the gladiators and,
you know, all the awful things

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that happened, it
was designed as a way

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.350 align:middle line:84%
to dissipate the energy of
rebellion in the people.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.342 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, really?

00:47:05.342 --> 00:47:06.300 align:middle line:90%
To bring them together?

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well, they
came together,

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.280 align:middle line:84%
but so that all of that energy
of wanting a better life

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and rebelling against
their circumstance

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.510 align:middle line:90%
went in to the fights they saw.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:16.590 align:middle line:90%
It was dissipated.

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.480 align:middle line:90%
It drew it off.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So today, I don't
think it's by design,

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:29.250 align:middle line:84%
but our reality TV culture,
what they all do, by nature,

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:32.790 align:middle line:84%
is you are not in
community, but it gives you

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:34.380 align:middle line:90%
the illusion of community.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Like you vote or you think
you're participating,

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.122 align:middle line:90%
but you have had no connection.

00:47:40.122 --> 00:47:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Remember the game
king of the hill?

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well that is a practice
ground for the go away tribe

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:90%
and for extreme competition.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Because you remember,
that game is

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:56.640 align:middle line:84%
there can only be one person
at the top of the hill.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Everybody fights to get there,
literally kids on a hill.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.050 align:middle line:90%
And once you get there--

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:04.230 align:middle line:90%
and I remember playing as a kid.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Once you get there, it's
the worst, most frightening,

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:84%
loneliest, paranoid
place in the world

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.130 align:middle line:90%
because everybody's after you.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And how different that
is than the fact, when I

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:16.170 align:middle line:90%
learned finally, you know what?

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.817 align:middle line:84%
There's room enough
up here for everyone.

00:48:18.817 --> 00:48:20.150 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to play this game.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.066 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you really
look at everywhere how,

00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:23.525 align:middle line:84%
when you started
on this journey,

00:48:23.525 --> 00:48:25.650 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't see how it
would end because it isn't.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:26.220 align:middle line:90%
It's endless.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.195 align:middle line:90%
It's an endless topic.

00:48:27.195 --> 00:48:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: It is endless,
and so a couple of things

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to share that I've
learned through this.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And one is that,
through all the stories,

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.800 align:middle line:84%
if there's one kind of
insight or recurring

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.040 align:middle line:84%
theme across culture
and history, is time

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and again, when fear
makes a group of people

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:57.950 align:middle line:84%
think that self-interest
will protect them,

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:84%
love and suffering affirm that
we're more together than alone.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:04.580 align:middle line:90%
So interesting, yeah.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.831 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Over and over again
in all different cultures.

00:49:06.831 --> 00:49:08.746 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's what
you state in the book,

00:49:08.746 --> 00:49:10.160 align:middle line:90%
and I think that's so great.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.209 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:13.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole online
community that you've also

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.970 align:middle line:84%
built around this as well so
people can find each other.

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Well you know,
I'm just offering a tool.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:22.580 align:middle line:10%
You know, in all my books,
I try to offer questions

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:26.480 align:middle line:10%
that help personalize the
lessons in individual life.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we've created is there
is an online community guide.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the book,
as you know, there

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.870 align:middle line:84%
are questions that
invite you to gather two

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:37.557 align:middle line:84%
or three friends,
four or five friends--

00:49:37.557 --> 00:49:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love that.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:40.556 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: --and actually take
some of the things we're

00:49:40.556 --> 00:49:44.370 align:middle line:84%
talking about, and see where
it lives in your own life,

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:46.650 align:middle line:90%
in your own community.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So in an example,
one of the notions

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:53.210 align:middle line:84%
in the Jewish tradition,
there's a phrase, tikkun olam,

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:56.960 align:middle line:84%
which means we are here
to repair the world.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.874 align:middle line:84%
Now inherent in that
is we are the world,

00:49:58.874 --> 00:50:01.040 align:middle line:84%
so the first thing is we've
got to repair ourselves.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.414 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm hm.

00:50:02.414 --> 00:50:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Well I love to ask
my guests, what

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:08.210 align:middle line:84%
is your biggest why, you biggest
reason why you do what you do?

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.750 align:middle line:84%
20 books, tour with Oprah,
everything you've done,

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.010 align:middle line:90%
journey through cancer, why?

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:19.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NEPO: Well, I think why I
venture into the inner life,

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:26.560 align:middle line:10%
into the heart space
is because I just want

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.510 align:middle line:10%
and need to be as alive as
possible while I'm here.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.684 align:middle line:90%
And I need to--

00:50:33.684 --> 00:50:37.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, this is in the
come teach me tribe, is,

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:40.630 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've written 20 books
because I write about what I

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.054 align:middle line:90%
need to know, not what I know.

00:50:43.054 --> 00:50:44.470 align:middle line:84%
If I only wrote
about what I knew,

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I would have
written very little.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why
I do interviews.

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:49.440 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.550 align:middle line:90%
I learn so much from this space.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Well thank you so much for
showing us truly, repetitively,

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.550 align:middle line:84%
in history and going
forward, how we

00:50:57.550 --> 00:50:59.200 align:middle line:90%
are more together than alone.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NEPO: Oh, a joy
to be with you.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Thank you so much.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NEPO: Thank you.

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.475 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And if you'd like
to watch other interviews

00:51:03.475 --> 00:51:06.370 align:middle line:10%
with Mark Nepo, you can go
to "Inspirations" on Gaia

00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:08.080 align:middle line:10%
and you can check
them out there.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, and
until next time,

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.410 align:middle line:90%
I invite you to stay aware.

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:15.760 align:middle line:90%
