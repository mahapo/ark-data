00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.730 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA GARR: Hi, I'm Lisa Garr,
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.565 align:middle line:10%
My guest, Pamela Oslie,
says that parallel universes

00:00:18.565 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:10%
are like watching
multiple TVs all at once,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
like they're all going
on simultaneously.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:84%
For 28 years, Pam
Oslie says she's

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
been able to see auras and the
human energy field in colors.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:84%
She says that there are multiple
dimensions on many levels,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and they're all based on
what you want to have happen.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is
if everything is energy,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:84%
then we can create
whatever we want.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.578 align:middle line:90%
>>PAM OSLIE: It's true.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:45.304 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Welcome.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Thanks, Lisa.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what do you
mean that we can actually

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.011 align:middle line:90%
create whatever we want?

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, it's all thought,
and it's all energy, right?

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And we've experimented with it.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.787 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact that I
can see energy fields,

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:57.536 align:middle line:84%
and I can talk to
people on the other side

00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:90%
and parallel universes.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.109 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:10%
>>OSLIE: The power of our
consciousness is amazing.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:10%
And we use it to create
what we want all the time.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:10%
Well, let me rephrase that.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:10%
We don't always
get what we want.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:10%
We always get what we believe.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:10%
So we are creating our lives.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.284 align:middle line:10%
We're creating our
reality with our beliefs

00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:14.700 align:middle line:10%
and our thoughts
and our emotions.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That explains it.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Did you always see colors?

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Did this happen
to you as a child?

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: No.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: No.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: No.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
No, I started seeing-- well,
first, about 30 years ago,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm only 27-- so
about 30 years ago,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I went to hear a psychic speak.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into the
room, huge group of people,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and he pulled me up in front
of the room that day and said,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.218 align:middle line:90%
you know how to do this work.

00:01:35.218 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Come up here.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So I started seeing psychic
information about people.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:90%
That's how I started.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Then about a year later, I met
a woman who could see auras.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
She could see energy fields
and the different colors.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And what she
described, what she was

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:84%
seeing with people,
matched with what

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I was picking up
psychically about people.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.465 align:middle line:84%
So then I went, oh,
that's a violet.

00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's a yellow.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.036 align:middle line:90%
I get it now.

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And within a year
of meeting her,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I developed the ability to
see auras or energy fields.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.904 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do the different
colors mean-- well, first

00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
of all, let me ask you,
as you're sitting here

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.967 align:middle line:84%
looking at me, do you see
color vibrating around me,

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:90%
or do you see it in?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Where do you see it?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's a glow that
comes off of everyone.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And the way I see
it-- now, other people

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.034 align:middle line:90%
see the energy differently.

00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:84%
But some people, a lot of
people see the same things I do,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
especially a lot of
kids, which is exciting.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I see lots of different
colored bands out from you.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And the one or two
colors of bands

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
that glow off of you like
light from a light bulb, those

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
are what reveal
your personality,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:84%
the theme you've chosen
for this lifetime,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.966 align:middle line:84%
careers you're going
to be drawn to, how

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
you are in relationship,
money, health issues.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:90%
It's all in those two bands.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.057 align:middle line:84%
The outer bands
change all the time

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
according to what's going
on with you at the time.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, OK,
so that can shift.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
But the core of who you are,
your purpose, why you came here

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.459 align:middle line:90%
stays the same.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you
associate that with colors.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:90%
They are colors.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:90%
I see them in color.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you turn this on
and off, or is it always there?

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: I turn it on and off.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.308 align:middle line:84%
I explain to people, it's
like if you're walking down

00:03:02.308 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:84%
the street, you know everybody's
wearing clothes, I'm assuming.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But you don't always choose
to focus on what colors

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
they're wearing or
any of that stuff.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:90%
I just ignore it.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:90%
So you said I'm a violet yellow.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.354 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:03:14.354 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What does that mean?

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.185 align:middle line:90%
What does the violet color mean?

00:03:17.185 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Violets are the
visionaries on the planet.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
You guys come from
the third eye chakra.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Violets are the humanitarians,
the visionaries.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
You're actually here to
shift the consciousness

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, to
educate the masses,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to improve the quality
of life for people.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Violets usually like
to work for themselves.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I see them a lot in the
media because you guys

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:90%
have messages to get out.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the same
aura colors as Oprah.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Violets have to
reach the masses.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:90%
So the media works for you.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Violets are arts or
music or performing,

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
or violets get involved
in teaching or psychology.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Violets can read people, or
violets get involved in causes

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
help the poor starving

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:84%
children or the homeless
people or animals, something

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
to improve the quality of life.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Or some violets will get
involved in politics and law.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, yellows don't usually
like politics and law.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's the violet part.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:90%
You violets are multitaskers.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
projects usually going on.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Definitely.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, but it
needs to make a difference.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.641 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could it
have anything to do

00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:16.474 align:middle line:84%
with me resonating
towards that color a lot,

00:04:16.474 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
like I wear a lot of purple
or I love purple clothes?

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.045 align:middle line:90%
Does it matter?

00:04:20.045 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: A lot of people do wear
their aura colors, not always.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.503 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've also got
yellow in your aura,

00:04:24.503 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:90%
and yellows are big kids.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Yellows have a sense of humor.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:90%
They're playful.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:90%
They need variety.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Both your colors need variety.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of those colors
like to sit behind a desk

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.285 align:middle line:90%
and do the same thing every day.

00:04:35.285 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Those are tans.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's death to me.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.689 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.475 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:40.308 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Violets have
to do the big picture,

00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and yellows are creative
people, or they do healing work,

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
or they do physical work, like
they do sports, or exercise,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
or yoga instructors,
or cyclists.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can you teach
people to do this on their own?

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.645 align:middle line:90%
Can I learn how to do this?

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:54.186 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:04:54.186 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural ability.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:90%
We actually all have it.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And each of the
different aura colors

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:90%
has a different way of learning.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.757 align:middle line:90%
So yellows are more kinesthetic.

00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:90%
They tend to feel it more.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And in all honesty,
most of us do

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.010 align:middle line:90%
feel the energy field, the aura.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.624 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can
be around somebody

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and be comfortable
with them right away.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.706 align:middle line:84%
You don't mind
standing near them,

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:13.255 align:middle line:84%
and other people
you pull away from.

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:14.880 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're
feeling their aura.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling
their energy field.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So some people are
more kinesthetic.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:84%
You violets are the ones
that tend to see things.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:90%
You tend to see it first.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But yes, anybody can
learn how to do it.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So trust your instincts
is what you're saying.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.252 align:middle line:84%
If you feel-- even though
I might not see the colors,

00:05:32.252 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
trust when you feel that you
resonate with someone and when

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:90%
you don't.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.662 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right, right, yes.

00:05:36.662 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
certain aura colors

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
that are compatible
with each other.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So you'll probably get along
great with other violets

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and other yellows,
and certain colors

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
you might just-- you're
not as comfortable with.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.235 align:middle line:84%
So absolutely trust
your intuitions.

00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Like reds or--

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, sometimes
reds or out of power greens,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:90%
meaning the downside of greens.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.119 align:middle line:84%
Because the downside
greens are very smart.

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:90%
They're very sharp.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.346 align:middle line:90%
But they can be critical.

00:05:57.346 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
When they're in power,
they're amazing.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:90%
They accomplish things.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody's out
of power, the downside,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
you're probably not
going to be that

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with
their energy field.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And would somebody
know they were--

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
if they read the colors in
the book, they would resonate.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:90%
They would say, oh, that's me.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much a good way to
discover your own color, right?

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Right, well, I have a
quiz in my book "Life Colors."

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:84%
There's also my website,
lifecolorscity.com.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a free
quiz on there too.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can
determine your own color.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, and usually when
people read the descriptions

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.779 align:middle line:84%
or watch the videos or
whatever, you're exactly right.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:90%
They recognize themselves.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many
colors are there?

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Now, I see 14 different
aura colors in combinations.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, I have always
seen my daughter resonate

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:90%
towards kind of an opalescent.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not on the
rainbow necessarily,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's more of an
opalescent color.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.824 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of that that has
shininess in it, like an opal?

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Wow, that's pretty.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, people see colors
differently, right?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Just like I think we
taste food differently,

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.943 align:middle line:84%
because there are people out
that like Brussels sprouts,

00:07:00.943 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and I know they're not
tasting what I'm tasting.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.073 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I love them.

00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:06.885 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: So an opalescent, it
could be how I see the crystal.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:07.426 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Or she could have a, I
don't know what you see.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:90%
It could be a light blue.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is a crystal?

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Explain.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Crystals
are very spiritual,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.456 align:middle line:84%
but they tend to
be very fragile.

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So your daughter
feels like she's

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
got more energy and more
old soul energy to her.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:84%
When I see crystals, they
actually have clear auras.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And they take on the
aura colors of the people

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:90%
that they're around.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.349 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be healers, but
they tend to be a lot quieter.

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
They can't be around
a lot of people.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, your
daughter feels more old soul

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.131 align:middle line:90%
and vivacious.

00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.213 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: She's got
a real personality,

00:07:37.213 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:84%
so whatever you're
seeing is you.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Although when I first started
seeing auras, I saw white.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I just saw white.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And so most people,
when they first

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:84%
start seeing auras, that's
what they see is a white color.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.729 align:middle line:84%
So that may be what you're
seeing with sparkles.

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever
see an aura of somebody

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
who is not necessarily
from this planet?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: I haven't
seen that, no,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
although magentas
can act that way.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And indigos-- like Michael
Jackson was an indigo.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.237 align:middle line:84%
They can appear to be
very not from this planet.

00:08:09.237 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: They tend to
be very androgynous.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I know Elizabeth
Taylor even said

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:84%
about Michael Jackson,
when you look in his eyes,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
he didn't feel like
he was from here.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So indigos can come
across that way, yes.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That was
a bold question.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.816 align:middle line:84%
I knew you would know
what I was talking about

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:26.764 align:middle line:84%
because you talk a lot about
energy, and parallel universes,

00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
different topics.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
you're a stranger

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:90%
to any of those topics, right?

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Right,
no, no, not at all.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what I said
earlier in the show

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
is everything is energy
and that we can really

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:90%
create what we want.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.322 align:middle line:90%
What did you mean by that?

00:08:39.322 --> 00:08:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Well, you know what?

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:84%
E equals MC squared says
that matter is energy.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:90%
It's interchangeable.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics,
you've had so many people

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:90%
talking about quantum physics.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Basically at the
energetic field,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
at the basic core of
what we're made of,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:90%
there's no such thing as matter.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It's all empty space
and energy waves.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And so if we really get
that-- Lisa, oh my gosh,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I love what quantum physics is
saying about who we really are.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
If we really get
it's about energy

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and that our thoughts and
our beliefs and our emotions

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
actually affect that
energy and create matter.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:90%
We create things from energy.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we are energy
slowed down, right?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, well,
although when I see the aura,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:84%
it vibrates at
different frequencies.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it's all energy.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and at different
frequencies, yes.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Some of it's slower.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, usually
when something resonates

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
sort of slow, we turn into
matter or it becomes matter.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But with the aura
colors, a red vibration

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
is a deeper, denser
vibration than, say,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:90%
an indigo or a violet.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.299 align:middle line:84%
They just vibrate at
different frequencies.

00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make
anything bad or good.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just different frequencies.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I want to show a
clip here of you talking

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
about energy at a
recent TED talk.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:56.936 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:56.936 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:10%
>>OSLIE: I like Einstein's
quote-- I'll paraphrase him.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:10%
I can't find the exact quote--
that a problem can never

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:10%
be solved by the same thinking
or the same consciousness that

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:10%
created the problem
in the first place.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:10%
So in order to change
our lives and our world,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:10%
we need to dramatically
change how we're thinking.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And what I think is cool is
that quantum physics-- nobody

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:10%
glaze over-- quantum
physics is telling us

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:10%
something amazing about who we
really are, about the nature

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:10%
of reality.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:10%
And we're not living it.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's very profound.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:10%
We're still living
with the belief system

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:10%
of classical physics, which
is hundreds of years old.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:10%
My gosh, we don't even
hold on to our computers

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:10%
or cellphones more
than a couple years,

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:10%
and we're still carrying
a belief system that

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:10%
is hundreds of years old.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:10%
So just to give you an
example, classical physics

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:10%
says, basically, that number
one, everything is solid,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:10%
and we're separate
from everything else.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:10%
Number two, that consciousness
is generated from the brain.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:10%
And number three-- these
are just three things now.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:10%
There's lots of things
that classical physics

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:10%
is saying about reality.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:10%
But number three that
there's only one reality

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:10%
and that it's linear.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, quantum physics is
saying the exact opposite.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:10%
It's profound.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:10%
It's actually saying that, one,
everything is made of energy,

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:10%
and there's no
separation at all,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:10%
that there's no empty
space between us.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:10%
It's also saying that
consciousness is non-local,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:10%
which is profound,
and that we're not

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:10%
separate from anything,
that there's no empty space.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.780 align:middle line:10%
And quantum physics
is also saying

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:10%
that there is more
than one reality.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:10%
You guys, that's huge.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.610 align:middle line:10%
That's huge.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.984 align:middle line:10%
Parallel universes, they're
talking about, and I'm going,

00:11:41.984 --> 00:11:44.137 align:middle line:10%
is anybody out there
paying attention

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:10%
to what they're saying
with quantum physics?

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:10%
This is radical.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:10%
It's profound.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:10%
Even Stanford quotes
how radical this

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:10%
is that quantum physics
has a completely different

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:10%
understanding of reality,
and we're not living it.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:10%
So, let's just look at
some of the first things

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:10%
that they're saying.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:10%
One of the mindsets of or one of
the great formulas that quantum

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:10%
physics is saying is
E equals MC squared.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, we've all
heard that, right?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.036 align:middle line:10%
Most people don't have
a clue what that means,

00:12:12.036 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:10%
and it's very profound.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:10%
E equals MC squared says that
everything is made of energy.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:10%
At the foundation of matter,
everything is energy.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.525 align:middle line:10%
Now, you guys, that's amazing.

00:12:23.525 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if
that blows you away,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:10%
but it kind of blows me away.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Because what does this mean?

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:10%
That if they go into
atomic particles, atoms,

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:10%
they see empty space and a
lot of subatomic particles.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.892 align:middle line:10%
Every time they keep
going further into matter,

00:12:36.892 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:10%
they're not finding
anything solid there.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:10%
It's all energy.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:10%
So what does this mean for us?

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:10%
Well, first of all,
if we really got that,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:10%
if we really understood that
everything's made of energy,

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:10%
we wouldn't be getting sick.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:10%
We wouldn't be aging.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:10%
We wouldn't be dying.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:10%
There wouldn't be scarcity.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:10%
There wouldn't be poverty.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:10%
Oh my gosh, that's a
radical way to change

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:10%
how we're living our lives.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:10%
But we're not doing it.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:10%
So, OK, with energy,
how does that-- what can

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:10%
I do with energy?

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:10%
Well, I can see
auras around people.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:10%
I can see that you're
made of energy.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:10%
I see the energy
radiating off of you.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not the only
person that does this.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:10%
And not only that, all of us.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:10%
If my consciousness
is able to do that,

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:10%
everyone's consciousness
is able to do that.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.683 align:middle line:10%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so you said that
everything is an illusion

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.299 align:middle line:84%
and that everything that we are
creating is just our own movie.

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Explain this.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.975 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well,
you know, Einstein

00:13:32.975 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:84%
said reality is an illusion,
albeit a very persistent one.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:90%
That's Einstein.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these
quantum physicists

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
know that basically we're
kind of making it up.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, they've got
the double slit experiment

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to prove this if people
want to look that up.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's our
thoughts and our beliefs

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.832 align:middle line:84%
that create our
reality, and that's

00:13:55.832 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:90%
what they're actually saying.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So when we pay attention to
our beliefs, our thoughts,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:90%
we affect the energy around us.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
They're even saying there's
no such thing as empty space.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no empty space.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy around us.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how can our
thoughts create our reality?

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So if I really want something,
say I want to sell my house,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.775 align:middle line:84%
I put that thought
out to the universe,

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:90%
but yet the house doesn't sell.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
How are you saying there's
conflicting thoughts here?

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, what I said
before is that you don't always

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:90%
get what you want.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:90%
You always get what you believe.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.945 align:middle line:84%
So on some level, there
was a belief on something.

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it was
at that point, like, well,

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:84%
the market's hard,
or I don't really

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:90%
want to let go of the house.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's going
to take a while.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.713 align:middle line:84%
You would have to go back
and look at your beliefs

00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.574 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could it be
someone else's belief?

00:14:44.574 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Oh boy, this
is a great conversation.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like a realtor,
or a family member,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: If you
believe that, yes.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, otherwise, I believe
we have absolute free will.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.935 align:middle line:90%
And you've created by thought.

00:14:55.935 --> 00:14:57.435 align:middle line:84%
I know you've done
that, and so have

00:14:57.435 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I. I've got great stories
about being able to do that.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:90%
So do you.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you believe that someone
else can affect your outcome,

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:90%
then they will.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that you
have absolute free will

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and that you can create
anything you want,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:90%
then that's what happens.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How have you
done that in your life?

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Oh my gosh.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Share.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.561 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, for
example, I've been

00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:90%
able to bend spoons and forks.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.250 align:middle line:90%
I was in Hawaii once.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
This is in my book,
"Infinite You."

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.795 align:middle line:84%
I was in Hawaii, and because
I know that it's all energy

00:15:23.795 --> 00:15:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and that Einstein even
said that imagination

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
knowledge because it's

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:84%
our imagination that
creates these things.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.075 align:middle line:84%
So I arrived in Maui,
and the weather report

00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
said it's going to
be raining all week.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, no, no.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:90%
No, not on my vacation.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So that night I went to
bed after I'd arrived--

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It always
rains in Hawaii.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: No, they said it
was going to be pouring rain,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
the entire island,
no sun for a week.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.014 align:middle line:84%
And I went, no,
that's not acceptable.

00:15:52.014 --> 00:15:53.513 align:middle line:84%
So I went to bed
that night knowing.

00:15:53.513 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I just went, no, it's going
to be blue sky when I wake up.

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.540 align:middle line:84%
My vacation, blue sky,
sunshine, the whole bit.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I got up the next morning,
blue sky out there.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
So I grabbed my towel.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:90%
I went out to the beach.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.850 align:middle line:90%
We had a little private beach.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm out there for
about half an hour later,

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
all these people were coming
onto our little private beach.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.810 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what is going on?

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a private beach,
and this couple came over

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
to me, and they
said, we have been

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.765 align:middle line:84%
driving around
this entire island.

00:16:17.765 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:84%
It is pouring everywhere
but this beach.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh really?

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: That was
me visualizing.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we can
affect the weather.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:90%
We do it all the time.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.449 align:middle line:84%
They've got all kinds of
experiments to show this.

00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my gosh.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.365 align:middle line:84%
I should have known-- met
you before I got married.

00:16:32.365 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Our wedding was rained out.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying
that you can-- now,

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
do you do something in order
to specifically channel

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that much energy to
affect the weather?

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, what I have
noticed is the intensity.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a passion
towards something,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:90%
it seems to manifest quicker.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
If you've sort of got
conflicting, well, I want it,

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
if it's possible,

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
as long as you have more
belief in this than less,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:90%
it'll eventually happen.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:90%
It just might take time.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
But I've gotten to
the point now where

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:84%
I know that I can have an
easy thought, let it go,

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.155 align:middle line:90%
and it happens.

00:17:05.155 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: So it doesn't
have to take struggle.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.471 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is it practice
that gets you there,

00:17:09.471 --> 00:17:12.797 align:middle line:84%
or you have attuned yourself
with certain vibrations,

00:17:12.797 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:90%
or what is it?

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.713 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Practice is a good one.

00:17:14.713 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really, bottom
line Lisa, it's about belief.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's so funny because I've
manifested amazing things.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.562 align:middle line:90%
So have you, I'm sure.

00:17:22.562 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I have
these moments where

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh, it didn't happen.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:90%
I fall down.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like I didn't
believe it strong enough.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I had doubt, and so
it doesn't happen.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like a child learning
how to-- we started crawling.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:90%
We learned how to walk.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:84%
We probably didn't walk
the very first time

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.752 align:middle line:90%
we started doing that.

00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:90%
So you know what it is, Lisa?

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I really believe we're
learning a new consciousness.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
We're learning that this is
the way reality really is.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And again, the double
slit experiment, things

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
like that where it's a
wave and when somebody,

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.782 align:middle line:84%
when an observer--
see, I'm jumping to it.

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Go ahead, yeah.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: OK, so what this
experiment says because it has

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.986 align:middle line:84%
to do with parallel
universes, too--

00:17:58.986 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We heard a little
bit about it in the clip.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:90%
But yes,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.555 align:middle line:90%
expand.

00:18:01.555 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So they send a single
atom of light, a photon,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:84%
through a slit in a partition,
and on the other side

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.830 align:middle line:84%
it shows as one line where
all these photons of light

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:90%
go through this once slit.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:90%
They expected that.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Then they open up a
second slit and only

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
send one photon of light
at a time through the slit.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side,
what they found out was it

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:90%
didn't go through one at a time.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:84%
On the other side was an
interference pattern which,

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:84%
cutting to the chase,
just means that it

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
went through both of
them simultaneously.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It moved into both
places at the same time

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and turned into a wave
and went through it

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and so showed up as an
interference pattern.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they noticed is they
put cameras or an observer

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to watch to see when it
split from one particle

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:84%
to go into both
at the same time.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as an
observer was watching it,

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.820 align:middle line:90%
it only went through one.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the observer
affected the outcome?

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.785 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, the
observer actually--

00:19:00.785 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and they said, oh my
gosh, the observer

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
is actually creating
the reality.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's the basis
of how they're

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
seeing that consciousness
is basically

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.919 align:middle line:84%
creating what we're seeing
and what we're observing.

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, we haven't been
taught that way.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught to believe
that there's things outside

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:16.410 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:90%
We have no control over it.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:84%
We have no control
over other people.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's not about controlling.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It's about our belief,
and we actually

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.230 align:middle line:84%
create it with our own
stories, with our own belief

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.905 align:middle line:90%
about reality.

00:19:26.905 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, you're basically
taking the quantum physics

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
model and applying it
to personal development.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So bringing our
thoughts and our reality

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and creating what we
want, like attracts like.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:90%
We bring that into our life.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So how do you know if you're
not doing this in your life?

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:84%
What does your life look
like if that isn't working?

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.559 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Well, it won't show up.

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Basically when people go, well,
how do I know what I believe?

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I go, well, look at your life.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Your life reflects back to
you what you're believing.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.616 align:middle line:84%
If people think it's
hard work, it's struggle,

00:19:57.616 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
experience that.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:84%
They're going to gather
evidence to support that.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
That's what they'll
see in their lives.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you explain
different levels

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
of universes or
different universes.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Oh, parallel
universes, this

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:90%
is another quantum physics.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.740 align:middle line:90%
This is what gets me excited.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So basically what they're saying
is there are parallel universes

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
around you all the time
as close as your breath.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And the way I like to
explain this in lay terms

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
is, right now, there's at least
10 radio stations broadcasting.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And the radio waves are
around you all the time,

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know they
exist because you're not

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.635 align:middle line:90%
tuned into them.

00:20:33.635 --> 00:20:35.176 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Different
frequencies, right?

00:20:35.176 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, so if you went
over to a radio frequency--

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:84%
a radio sta-- a radio and
turned it on to, say, 99.9,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to hear the
waves, the talk, the music that

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.415 align:middle line:90%
comes out of that show, right?

00:20:47.415 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The signal will
be transmitting to that,

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.079 align:middle line:84%
and then that signal will
come to 99.9, that frequency.

00:20:54.079 --> 00:20:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Right, and you'll
hear the music and the talk.

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:90%
That becomes your reality.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.103 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:20:58.103 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Now, if you adjust the
dial or the button or whatever

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and you move it over
to 107, now you're

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
going to hear the music and
the talk that's coming out

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
of that frequency, 107, and
that becomes your reality.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.159 align:middle line:84%
Well, 99.9 is still
broadcasting all around you,

00:21:13.159 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
but you're not tuned
into it anymore.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not part of your reality.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:90%
You're tuned into this one.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the parallel
universes are working.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And we think there's only
one reality, one universe,

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
but we change in and out
of them all the time, Lisa,

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:90%
based on decisions that we make.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you
change your frequency

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
or you use your imagination to
imagine something different,

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:84%
it actually pulls you into
another parallel universe.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:90%
But they're seamless.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
There's not doorways
between them,

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:90%
so we don't know we did that.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.025 align:middle line:84%
You just think you're still
living in one universe.

00:21:44.025 --> 00:21:44.608 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:21:44.608 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So can one universe
say I'm not good enough

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and another universe say,
OK, I am now good enough?

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Or one universe could
represent a trauma that

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
happened in your life, but you
could go into another universe

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:90%
where that didn't happen?

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: That's exactly right.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really?

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: That's exactly right.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.430 align:middle line:84%
People actually do
spontaneous remission

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.655 align:middle line:90%
in their healings this way.

00:22:01.655 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:90%
They're traumatized--

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But isn't that called
multiple personalities?

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's called
multiple universes.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.240 align:middle line:84%
People have spontaneous
healings where

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:84%
their deadly-- they've got
cancer that's taking them out,

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden they have
no cancer in their body anymore.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.547 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's no medical
explanation for that.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:90%
We can call them miracles.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
We can call them whatever, but
it's a shift in consciousness.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a shift in reality.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sometimes I
call it visualization,

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.960 align:middle line:84%
but I can actually go
into a visualization

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and create something exactly
the way that I want it

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and see the end
result and then come

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.715 align:middle line:84%
back to now with
that as a memory.

00:22:39.715 --> 00:22:41.962 align:middle line:84%
Is this me going into
another universe?

00:22:41.962 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, that's
one way of doing it.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.586 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Visualization.

00:22:44.586 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes, that's one way.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:90%
That is one way to do it.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.524 align:middle line:84%
I actually got to speak
with David Deutsch

00:22:50.524 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:90%
when I was in England.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
He's a world famous
quantum physicist,

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and his specialty is
parallel universes.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
He actually says that the
past you, the present you,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and the future you are
also in parallel universes.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
A past you is you, but
it's not the same you

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
that's sitting here today.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And a you in the future
is not the same you

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that's sitting here
today, but it's still you.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:90%
It's just in another universe.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like science
fiction, doesn't it?

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, could you and I be
in another universe right now?

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.150 align:middle line:84%
We're in multiple
universes all the time.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:84%
We're just focused on
this one right now.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is physics.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wonder
what we're doing.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Are we having lunch?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.641 align:middle line:90%
Are we-- what are we doing?

00:23:32.641 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, watch
how this works.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, what
they say is you could

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:84%
be walking down the street
on your way to a meeting

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and look and go, oh, I would
love to stop in that place

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:90%
and get a cup of coffee.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I don't have time,
and you keep going.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual
you that split off

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that went into Starbucks to
go get a cup of coffee that

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:84%
went on and is having a
completely different life

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
on her own, unaware that you're
having this life right here.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.652 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, it sounds
science fiction,

00:23:59.652 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%
but that's really
what's happening.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.129 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I like to do is,
well, how does that benefit us?

00:24:04.129 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.615 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: How does
that benefit us?

00:24:05.615 --> 00:24:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Right, how is
it practically used?

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:08.746 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Because
basically there's

00:24:08.746 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
also a you that married
somebody you met in high school,

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:90%
is having a whole life going on.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But I've used it to
change my reality.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I've used it to get a radio
show, my own radio show.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I've used it.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Practically, if you're
in a life-- we've all

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:84%
had those days where
you're having a terrible,

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:90%
oh, my life sucks.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel well.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.469 align:middle line:90%
Everything's falling apart.

00:24:29.469 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a vibration.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:84%
That's like listening to a song
on the radio that's like, oh,

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
my dog left me, and my truck
ran over my girlfriend.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:90%
It's that vibration.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
You change your
frequency, and all

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden everything
around you starts changing.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually a parallel
universe, or you can just say,

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I change my frequency.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But still, all of
a sudden everything

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:90%
starts happening for the better.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Good things, your
fortune changes.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same dialogue.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's just
changing your frequency.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:84%
It's changing what
it is that you

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:84%
believe in or want
to believe in.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And what you want
to create in your life.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you're trying
to create a new job,

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.270 align:middle line:84%
you can go into what you
call another universe,

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:84%
or a visualization,
or a meditation,

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
or whatever we want to call
it, and go into that state.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a state change.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.875 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: It is.

00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of
consciousness change.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And so people go,
what's the difference

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:90%
of just changing your mood?

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I have a really dramatic
story about what this did.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.387 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:25:29.387 --> 00:25:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Years and years
ago, I fell in love

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.630 align:middle line:84%
with this one musician,
head over heels for him.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want
anything to do with me.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:35.894 align:middle line:90%
I was a blonde.

00:25:35.894 --> 00:25:38.334 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't like blondes.

00:25:38.334 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So adamant that he wasn't
going to be with me,

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.210 align:middle line:90%
he moved to the East Coast.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I live in Santa Barbara.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
He moved to the East
Coast, said that's it.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Never coming back.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I learned about how to
use parallel universes,

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that
in that universe,

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't believing in myself.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel lovable.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:90%
I had low self-worth.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So I actually went
out on my deck one day

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and did a visualization where
I saw myself consciously

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.620 align:middle line:90%
go into different universes.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:90%
I labeled them.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:90%
I went, OK, I'm in universe one.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Universe two, I'm going to
see what's happening in there.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.784 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around, and I saw
he was still on the East Coast.

00:26:12.784 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
He was in love
with somebody else.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to come back.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I went, well, not going
to stay in this universe.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I went into five
different universes.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I actually envisioned myself
going into different places.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I went into universe five,
and I went, in this one,

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:90%
it felt different.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.130 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I was lovable.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Something in me shifted,
and in that universe,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.336 align:middle line:90%
I saw him on the East Coast.

00:26:36.336 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't talked to
him for two years now.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It took me two years to discover
about parallel universes.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't even talked to him.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:84%
In universe five, I
saw him giving notice

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.025 align:middle line:90%
to the band he was in.

00:26:48.025 --> 00:26:50.100 align:middle line:84%
In that universe, I
watched it happening.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I saw him breaking up with
whatever girl he was with.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:10%
I saw him planning on going
to Iowa to see his meditating

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:10%
friends, back to Los Angeles to
see his rock and roll friends.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.176 align:middle line:10%
And he was coming back to
Santa Barbara to be with me.

00:27:03.176 --> 00:27:05.227 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, did you
see into the future,

00:27:05.227 --> 00:27:06.810 align:middle line:84%
or did you see what
you wanted to see?

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: No.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I went into a universe
where this was happening.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I felt it.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I saw it happening.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:90%
I felt the sun on my body.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:90%
I could smell the air.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I watched him doing
this in this universe.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a psychic thing.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I actually felt myself
in a different universe.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, just so you know,
too, in universe one,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.404 align:middle line:84%
all my girlfriends
were complaining

00:27:26.404 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:90%
that there were no good men.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:90%
They were lonely.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:90%
They were tired of being single.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be in a
relationship in universe one.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:84%
When I went into universe
five, I saw that happening.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.249 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks after I had that
experience, I called him up.

00:27:39.249 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:90%
I tracked him down.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, in that universe,
he was in love with me.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't I
call him, right?

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:90%
I go, so, how are you doing?

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.765 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, two weeks ago,
I gave notice to the band.

00:27:47.765 --> 00:27:49.011 align:middle line:90%
I broke up with this girl.

00:27:49.011 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to Iowa.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.119 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to Los Angeles.

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:53.535 align:middle line:84%
He came back to Santa Barbara,
and we've been together now

00:27:53.535 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:90%
for 30 years.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh wow.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: 30 years,
and the weird thing

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
is in that universe,
when I was in it--

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and I felt different too-- all
my girlfriends in that universe

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.802 align:middle line:84%
were all of a sudden with
boyfriends or fiances.

00:28:05.802 --> 00:28:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, in that universe.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: So it wasn't
just me that changed.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.987 align:middle line:90%
They were all different too.

00:28:09.987 --> 00:28:12.278 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And did that actually
happen with them as well?

00:28:12.278 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.077 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they were all engaged
or with boyfriends.

00:28:15.077 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to go up to all of
them-- this was 30 years ago--

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and go, you know what?

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.469 align:middle line:84%
In universe one,
you're all lonely,

00:28:20.469 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:90%
and this one, you're all happy.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.384 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't.

00:28:22.384 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought they'd
think I was crazy.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:90%
But it really did happen.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so if you're trying
to create anything different,

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.350 align:middle line:84%
a different job or
a new relationship,

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.260 align:middle line:84%
now, how did you
learn how to do this?

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.644 align:middle line:84%
How did you learn to navigate
these different frequencies?

00:28:37.644 --> 00:28:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: I learned
it from reading

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.124 align:middle line:84%
my Seth books,
Seth, Jane Roberts.

00:28:41.124 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah, yes.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.998 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: I've learned how
to be psychic that way, how

00:28:43.998 --> 00:28:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to see energy fields,
how to talk to people

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.359 align:middle line:84%
on the other side,
how to see past lives.

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: For people that
don't know Seth, explain.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Jane Roberts channeled
an entity called Seth,

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and these books are
basically quantum physics.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's a book called "The
Nature of Personal Reality."

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of books.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:90%
The other one is "Seth Speaks."

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.853 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: So that's
where I learned

00:29:02.853 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:90%
how to do parallel universes.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And I went, well, if they exist,
we should be able to use them.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like if the
world is round, we

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:84%
should be able to
captivate on that.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.811 align:middle line:84%
If there are other planets
or other continents,

00:29:13.811 --> 00:29:15.060 align:middle line:90%
we should be able to use that.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Or learning
aerodynamics, we should

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:90%
be able to use those principles.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So what I see is quantum
physics is coming up

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:84%
with a whole lot of things
we don't know about.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And I study it enough to
go, well, if that is true,

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.382 align:middle line:90%
we should be able to access it.

00:29:29.382 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you help
other people do this?

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:31.844 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:29:31.844 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you guide them
into these different realms?

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, this is
my book, "Infinite You."

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I show people
what the principles are.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.970 align:middle line:90%
Just like-- watch, Lisa.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.290 align:middle line:84%
We used to think that flight
was impossible, right?

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Until they discovered
the principles of aerodynamic.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Now we take it for granted.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics has
principles, laws of nature

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that they've discovered,
and we're not using them.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I describe
what these capabilities are.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.854 align:middle line:90%
I share my experiences.

00:30:02.854 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Then I teach other
people how to do 'em.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I show the quantum
physics behind it

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
concepts behind it.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So going into
parallel universes,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I have meditations,
guided meditations.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.282 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people, once they
understand the principles,

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:90%
they know how to do it.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Other people like to
have visualizations.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Other people they do better
if they can get a meditation.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So I have lots of
different tools.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what have people
manifested in your teachings

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.400 align:middle line:84%
or that you've shown
this way, so to speak.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.086 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, one
of the biggest things

00:30:35.086 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that I hear from people,
they email me a lot,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:90%
is I manifested money.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I was struggling for money,
and I didn't have any money,

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and I started visualizing
money coming out of the ethers,

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
just like how you did it,
or in a parallel universe.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, money
started coming to me.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did they have to do
something in order for that

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:90%
to happen, like get a job or--

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: No.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of them go,
guy, I wanted this job,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.248 align:middle line:84%
and I stepped into a parallel
universe, and I got it.

00:30:57.248 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:90%
It actually worked.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.142 align:middle line:84%
Or I really wanted to
be with this person,

00:31:00.142 --> 00:31:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and now we're together.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.380 align:middle line:84%
That one's tricky,
because people

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:84%
think that you're
controlling someone else.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Other people, yeah.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: But your're not.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sometimes we
do this as a family,

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and my daughter's
a soccer player.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So she'll go into
another universe

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
where she's actually
played the game

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases won the game
and won it for her own personal

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:84%
best and hit all the
things that she--

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And her training comes out.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we use this all
the time as a family.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.090 align:middle line:84%
My husband actually
used it once,

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and he was sitting
in a conference,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:90%
and they had a giveaway.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was a giveaway of
this Surface computer,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and he had already put
his card in the thing.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting in the
audience, visualized it,

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.730 align:middle line:90%
went into a parallel universe.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And the person said,
and the winner is,

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:90%
and he said his name.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And they called his name at
the exact time that he said it.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.822 align:middle line:90%
And he won a $1,200 computer.

00:31:54.822 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
But we do play with
this realm all the time,

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted to find
out what we were doing.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Well, it works.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And when people go, well,
what about somebody else's

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.220 align:middle line:90%
free will?

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:90%
You get to create your own.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.120 align:middle line:84%
You align with the
same people, but they

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.410 align:middle line:84%
have the different
beliefs in that life.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They still exist in
parallel universe number

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.040 align:middle line:90%
one and two and three and four.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:84%
You just align
with the ones that

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.290 align:middle line:90%
believe the same things you do.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.831 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did that mean that the
other people in the conference

00:32:21.831 --> 00:32:22.450 align:middle line:90%
lost?

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair?

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: In that
reality they did.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.299 align:middle line:84%
In another reality, somebody
else won, in another universe.

00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I lost you there.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: OK, so watch.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:84%
If your husband won, say, in
parallel universe number five,

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:84%
in that one, yes, the people
in that universe lost.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:90%
He won it.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.503 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:32:39.503 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: But somebody
else could be

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:84%
focused on-- that's why we
talk about television sets--

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.470 align:middle line:84%
somebody else could have been
focused in parallel four,

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.810 align:middle line:84%
parallel universe number
four, where they won it.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.260 align:middle line:84%
But your husband
lost in that one.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.006 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's
limited amounts

00:32:54.006 --> 00:32:55.630 align:middle line:84%
of universes in your
experiences right?

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:56.421 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Unlimited.

00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:59.047 align:middle line:90%
Infinite number of universes.

00:32:59.047 --> 00:33:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Some examples,
I mean, my daughter's

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:90%
lost several games as well.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you're saying that
the other intention was stronger

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.690 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, or someone
else on the other team to win.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: No, because if somebody
had an intention to win it,

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.400 align:middle line:84%
they won in another lifetime,
in another parallel universe--

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- and your
daughter maybe didn't

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.720 align:middle line:84%
have the strong
enough belief that she

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.390 align:middle line:90%
was going to win that day.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to take a
look at another video here

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.252 align:middle line:84%
of the TED talk where Pam shares
a little bit of this story

00:33:28.252 --> 00:33:28.960 align:middle line:90%
and so much more.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.594 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:33:29.594 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:10%
>>OSLIE: I'm able to
use parallel universes

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.880 align:middle line:10%
to dramatically change my life.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:10%
So the way that parallel
universes works,

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you've heard the
double slit experiment where

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:10%
they put a partition.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.860 align:middle line:10%
They put two slits and then
a screen on the other side.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:10%
And what they did was they
shot one single photon

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.210 align:middle line:10%
through this slit,
expecting to see

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.690 align:middle line:10%
on the screen on the far
side that one photon had

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:10%
gone through these double slits.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, what they found
instead is that somehow,

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:10%
mysteriously, this one photon
went into superposition.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.040 align:middle line:10%
It went into multiple
places at the same time

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.060 align:middle line:10%
and went through both slits
at the exact same time.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.989 align:middle line:10%
Now, that's pretty
radical right there.

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:12.300 align:middle line:10%
They couldn't figure it out.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.235 align:middle line:10%
But here's one of the
more radical things.

00:34:15.235 --> 00:34:16.610 align:middle line:10%
Quantum physics
says, oh my gosh,

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:10%
we're made of those
same particles.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.920 align:middle line:10%
So if those particles
could be in multiple places

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:10%
at the same time, so are we.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.902 align:middle line:10%
Again, sounds like science
fact-- fiction, right?

00:34:25.902 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:10%
Science faction, that's good.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.300 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.030 align:middle line:10%
And then the more
profound thing about it

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.010 align:middle line:10%
is when they had an observer
watching this particle

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:38.710 align:middle line:10%
to see when it split and went
into two at the same time,

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:10%
while they were watching it,
the particle didn't do that.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.180 align:middle line:10%
It behaved itself and went
through one slit only.

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:47.409 align:middle line:10%
They went, what the?

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:51.050 align:middle line:10%
OK, so what they've discovered
is that our consciousness

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:55.510 align:middle line:10%
is having an effect on reality,
that our consciousness is not

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.590 align:middle line:10%
only affecting reality,
but it may very well

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.120 align:middle line:10%
be creating reality.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.757 align:middle line:10%
So it's very interesting
to see that they believe

00:35:03.757 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:10%
that there's parallel universes.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, the way this works for
us is imagine-- this is real,

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.040 align:middle line:10%
now, you guys.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.290 align:middle line:10%
Imagine you're walking
down the street.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:10%
You're headed for
an appointment.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:10%
You see a store.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:10%
You go, oh, I'd really
like to go in there an buy

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:10%
a new pair of jeans.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I don't have time,
and you keep going.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.050 align:middle line:10%
There's an actual you that
split off, went into that store,

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:10%
and is having an
entire experience

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.630 align:middle line:10%
individual, separate from
you, living that life.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:30.320 align:middle line:10%
So right now there's a bunch of
you that are married to someone

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.460 align:middle line:10%
you met in high school.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.251 align:middle line:10%
Some of you have never
been married at all.

00:35:33.251 --> 00:35:36.620 align:middle line:10%
Some of you don't have the
jobs in parallel universes.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:10%
So this is really profound,
and they have evidence of this.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, the cool thing
is, I went, all right,

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to use this.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:46.660 align:middle line:10%
Years and years ago, I met
a guy, totally fell in love.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.365 align:middle line:10%
I'm a blue yellow, so we
blues, we love to be in love.

00:35:49.365 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:10%
Fell in love with this guy.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:10%
Oh my gosh, I have
to be with him.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:10%
Well, he was not going to
have anything to do with me,

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.150 align:middle line:10%
not attracted.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.880 align:middle line:10%
You're blonde.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.170 align:middle line:10%
I don't like blondes.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:10%
It was this big story.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.550 align:middle line:10%
I was devastated.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.290 align:middle line:10%
But I realized that
I was in a universe

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.150 align:middle line:10%
where I had the belief
that I wasn't lovable,

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.180 align:middle line:10%
that I wasn't attractive, that I
wasn't going to be good enough.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:12.300 align:middle line:10%
And I went, oh, now, wait a
second, parallel universes.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:10%
Let me see how this works.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:17.040 align:middle line:10%
So what I did was I
used my imagination.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:10%
I believed that other
universes really existed.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And so I used my imagination to
imagine myself in the universe

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.680 align:middle line:10%
where we were together.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:10%
And he had moved to the
East Coast in the meantime.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:10%
By the way, stay away from me.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.851 align:middle line:10%
Don't want to have
anything to do with you.

00:36:30.851 --> 00:36:32.830 align:middle line:10%
He moved all the way
across the country.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:37.109 align:middle line:10%
So in that version, I saw
him giving notice to the band

00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:39.650 align:middle line:10%
that he was with at the time,
breaking up with the girlfriend

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:10%
that he was with at the time.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.764 align:middle line:10%
Because you know musicians.

00:36:41.764 --> 00:36:43.600 align:middle line:10%
They always have
girlfriends, not for long,

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.530 align:middle line:10%
but they have them.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:48.200 align:middle line:10%
And then I saw him going to Iowa
to see his meditating friends.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.172 align:middle line:10%
I saw him coming
back to Los Angeles

00:36:50.172 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:10%
to see his rock and roll
friends and then coming back

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:10%
to Santa Barbara to be with
me because he was actually

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:10%
in love with me in this
universe over here.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:10%
I hadn't contacted
him for two years.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:10%
I got a hold of him two weeks
after I did that visualization.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.187 align:middle line:10%
Two weeks later, I called him.

00:37:05.187 --> 00:37:07.020 align:middle line:10%
Two weeks prior to that,
he had given notice

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.603 align:middle line:10%
to the band, broken up with his
girlfriend, was going to Iowa,

00:37:09.603 --> 00:37:13.190 align:middle line:10%
was going to LA, was coming back
to Santa Barbara to be with me.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.390 align:middle line:10%
We've been together
now for over 20 years.

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:21.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, the cool thing about that
is, people go, coincidence.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.797 align:middle line:10%
But the thing is, over in
this universe over here,

00:37:24.797 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:10%
all my girlfriends were single
and complaining about it.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.270 align:middle line:10%
There is no a good man.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.800 align:middle line:10%
I hate this.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:10%
I want to be in love.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:10%
I want to be married.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:32.770 align:middle line:10%
When I shifted over
into this other universe

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.840 align:middle line:10%
by using my imagination--
now remember,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:38.630 align:middle line:10%
Einstein does say imagination is
more important than knowledge,

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.770 align:middle line:10%
because knowledge is what we
think we know, can limit us.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.050 align:middle line:10%
Imagination is what
gives us this new life.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:45.220 align:middle line:10%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so I
want to learn this.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I want this to be
believable for me.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just on the edge there.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Explain to me on a quantum
physics level how this works.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, there
is physics behind it.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.436 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so cool.

00:37:56.436 --> 00:37:59.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, remember the double slit
experiment, how then when

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:84%
an observer looked at
it, the photon went back

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.380 align:middle line:84%
into one photon
and didn't change

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.745 align:middle line:84%
into a wave or multiple
positions at the same time,

00:38:07.745 --> 00:38:08.870 align:middle line:90%
go through both?

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:84%
They said, as soon as an
observer focuses on it,

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.800 align:middle line:84%
they felt like it collapsed
into just one photon.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:84%
But now what they're
saying is they

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.120 align:middle line:90%
don't believe it just collapsed.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
observer only saw one.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:27.080 align:middle line:84%
But all the other multiple
photons still exist,

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and they go on to have-- so
they believe there are parallel

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:90%
universes based on--

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
the photon just

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:90%
didn't collapse into one photon.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.060 align:middle line:84%
It was still in multiple
places simultaneously.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.860 align:middle line:84%
The observer only
experienced one

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:90%
because he only believed in one.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it
was a camera lens.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.254 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't--

00:38:46.254 --> 00:38:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Same
thing, the observer,

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:84%
they still-- the
observer still had

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:50.970 align:middle line:90%
to look through the camera lens.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So they used to think that
it collapsed into one when

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.815 align:middle line:90%
an observer interacted with it.

00:38:56.815 --> 00:38:58.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I wonder if it
was like a robotic camera

00:38:58.815 --> 00:39:01.822 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
operator-- that would never

00:39:01.822 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:90%
be the case though, would it?

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well,
because then somebody

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.300 align:middle line:84%
has to see what the
robotic camera picked up.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's still a human
consciousness attached to it.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: There's constantly, yes.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: So what they're
saying is it didn't just

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.590 align:middle line:84%
collapse into one, that all
of the others kept going.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.002 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's the old adage,
if a tree falls in the woods

00:39:19.002 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and no one hears it,
did it make a sound.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's the
same principle.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:90%
It's the same principle.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
saying, what tree?

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:90%
The observer created the tree.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So if there's no
observer, there's no tree.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is an endless
conversation, which I love,

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.290 align:middle line:84%
because you can--
yes, this has been

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.800 align:middle line:90%
proven in many different ways.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And lots of skeptics have
attempted to poke holes

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
in the experiments as well,
which some have and some

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.150 align:middle line:90%
haven't.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about
the possibilities.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not this exists,
if you believe it exists,

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:55.075 align:middle line:90%
it does, right?

00:39:55.075 --> 00:39:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually it exists
whether or not we believe in it.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
We just won't experience it
if we don't believe in it.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's cool.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:02.894 align:middle line:90%
So why not?

00:40:02.894 --> 00:40:04.459 align:middle line:90%
Why not believe in it?

00:40:04.459 --> 00:40:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Why not have fun with it?

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.458 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: You know what?

00:40:06.458 --> 00:40:08.500 align:middle line:84%
We didn't used to
believe in a round world.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:84%
We didn't used to
believe in aerodynamics.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.230 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:15.460 align:middle line:84%
I love Richard Bach's quote,
"argue for your limitations

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and they're yours."

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh yeah.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's like, I
don't like limitations.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.860 align:middle line:90%
We yellows like freedom.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.190 align:middle line:90%
We don't like boundaries.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to explore
what's possible

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and how we don't have boundaries
and then prove it to myself.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, is I
have proved it to myself.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:32.520 align:middle line:90%
I experience it.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I can understand how there
are skeptics out there.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.214 align:middle line:84%
If they haven't experienced
it for themselves, of course

00:40:37.214 --> 00:40:38.380 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be skeptic.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.963 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You know
what's fun about what

00:40:39.963 --> 00:40:42.645 align:middle line:84%
you do is that what
you're experiencing here

00:40:42.645 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:90%
is validation.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Even in the color readings, when
you tell me that I'm a violet

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and you explain the things
that go along with the violet,

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.839 align:middle line:84%
it gives me validation to know,
hey, I'm in the right place.

00:40:51.839 --> 00:40:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that
happens when you

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:84%
see two relationships
when they're together.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And you see-- it's
just really reassuring.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.097 align:middle line:84%
We don't get enough of that
during our day of, hey,

00:41:02.097 --> 00:41:03.180 align:middle line:90%
you're in the right place.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:03.846 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Agreed.

00:41:03.846 --> 00:41:07.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like to do the aura
colors is because it helps give

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:08.552 align:middle line:84%
people permission
to be who they are.

00:41:08.552 --> 00:41:10.301 align:middle line:84%
Because there are so
many people out there

00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.140 align:middle line:84%
running around feeling
like they're limited.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.185 align:middle line:84%
They're not in
happy relationships.

00:41:13.185 --> 00:41:14.680 align:middle line:90%
They're not in happy careers.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So this just opens things
up and gives people

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.260 align:middle line:84%
freedom and control and
power and creative control

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:20.969 align:middle line:90%
over their lives.

00:41:20.969 --> 00:41:22.551 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you
were to give someone

00:41:22.551 --> 00:41:25.490 align:middle line:84%
just a very simple step-by-step
process to be able to do this,

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.470 align:middle line:84%
to go into another universe
and create something,

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:29.970 align:middle line:90%
what would be the first step?

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: First step is you've
got to believe it's possible.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.419 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:32.419 --> 00:41:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Second one is
using your imagination

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and your energy
and your emotions.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what draws you into
a different frequency.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Our emotions have
frequency to it.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:90%
So do our thoughts.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:90%
They see it in brain waves.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts have
frequency to them.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you use your
imagination and your feelings,

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.560 align:middle line:90%
it creates in a universe.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It creates you, whether you
call it love, attraction

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.020 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
want to, it actually

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:90%
creates you being in that space.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.022 align:middle line:90%
And then it's practice.

00:42:00.022 --> 00:42:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then you also
have to know what you want.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.182 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right, right, clarity.

00:42:04.182 --> 00:42:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because that
doubter comes it and could

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.170 align:middle line:90%
sabotage the whole thing.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, even
if you don't know what

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:84%
you want, and a matter of fact,
most of us live out of default.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I don't
know if that that's possible.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So then whatever
happens, happens.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.175 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that
we're actually

00:42:16.175 --> 00:42:18.762 align:middle line:84%
creating that happening just
because we're not believing

00:42:18.762 --> 00:42:19.970 align:middle line:90%
that we can create something.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have another really
great concept about people

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:84%
that you have in your lives
are kind of like mirrors.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So how other people
treat you is basically

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.459 align:middle line:90%
how you treat yourself.

00:42:30.459 --> 00:42:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.083 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you explain
that concept a little bit?

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, it's part of
creating our own reality.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in your world
is a reflection of you.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody's
criticizing you,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.659 align:middle line:84%
it's a reflection of how
you're criticizing yourself.

00:42:43.659 --> 00:42:45.950 align:middle line:84%
If someone's not treating
you well, somewhere deep down

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:84%
inside, you're not
treating yourself well.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.610 align:middle line:84%
If you have a judgment
of somebody else,

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.589 align:middle line:84%
it's a reflection of some
judgment you have of yourself.

00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or if someone
is judging you,

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.930 align:middle line:84%
it's a reflection that you
have a judgment of yourself.

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: That's right.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:58.470 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:00.053 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where else,
how else does this

00:43:00.053 --> 00:43:03.120 align:middle line:84%
show up where it comes
with jobs, relationships?

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Does this relate to the
parallel universe conversation?

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Well, all
of it, all of it.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:07.800 align:middle line:90%
You want to have a fun game?

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Watch this fun game,
and then your listeners

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:10.490 align:middle line:90%
can watch this one, too.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a basic example
of how this works.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, right now, look
around the room.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And you at home, look
around the room right now.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Notice everything
you see that's blue.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.666 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Just really look at
everything that's blue, Lisa.

00:43:21.666 --> 00:43:23.551 align:middle line:90%

00:43:23.551 --> 00:43:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Think you got it
all, everything that's blue?

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I think so.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.541 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: OK, and
everybody at home do this.

00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:30.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, now close your
eyes, and tell me

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.720 align:middle line:84%
everything you just
saw that was blue.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The books, the
vase behind your head,

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%
your dress is an aqua.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.460 align:middle line:90%
That's about it.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Really, nothing
else that was blue in here

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.700 align:middle line:90%
that you missed?

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.045 align:middle line:90%
OK, did you miss anything?

00:43:45.045 --> 00:43:46.795 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your eyes now
that I look at them.

00:43:46.795 --> 00:43:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: OK, good.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.421 align:middle line:90%
OK, now, close your eyes.

00:43:48.421 --> 00:43:50.657 align:middle line:84%
And with your eyes
closed, tell me everything

00:43:50.657 --> 00:43:51.740 align:middle line:90%
you just saw that was red.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.010 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The pillow over
there, my dress, and possibly

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:90%
my lipstick.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: OK, open your eyes.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.430 align:middle line:90%
Did you miss anything?

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, the box.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: OK, and
so here's the deal.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:84%
You were actually good
because you're observant.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Most people, they close
their eyes and go, wait,

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see any red.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like because you
had an agenda going on

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:16.421 align:middle line:90%
to look for blue.

00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Right, so the red was
still there all along anyway,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:84%
but you had an agenda
to look for blue,

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.180 align:middle line:90%
so you didn't notice the red.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So when people have a belief
or an agenda going on that love

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.210 align:middle line:90%
never works for me.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:29.770 align:middle line:84%
There's no good
people out there.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm lonely, they're going
to see that in their world.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You only see
what you want to see.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: You see
what you believe.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You see
what you believe.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.467 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: You have
an agenda going on.

00:44:38.467 --> 00:44:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's
other things going

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.537 align:middle line:84%
on all the time around
you, you don't notice it

00:44:42.537 --> 00:44:44.370 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
a belief or an agenda

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.600 align:middle line:90%
going on that they exist.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It could be one of
the most unconscious things

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.030 align:middle line:90%
that you live with as well.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.655 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: It is.

00:44:49.655 --> 00:44:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, I have a friend
who just had her wallet stolen.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Yet her belief in life is
everyone's out to get me.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So would that wallet
stealing have happened to her

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.445 align:middle line:90%
if she didn't have that belief?

00:45:05.445 --> 00:45:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who's to say?

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: No, it wouldn't have.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.650 align:middle line:90%
It probably wouldn't have.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.029 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But that is
how she lives her life.

00:45:11.029 --> 00:45:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Exactly, so that's
what she experiences.

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a
subtle thing where

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:17.650 align:middle line:84%
she might believe that
it's possible for her

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:20.310 align:middle line:84%
to get her wallet
stolen, but she

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.460 align:middle line:84%
didn't believe it was going
to happen to her maybe.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.501 align:middle line:84%
Or she had the thought
that, well, it's possible,

00:45:24.501 --> 00:45:25.480 align:middle line:90%
but it probably won't.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So in a universe that
it did happen to her,

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:30.990 align:middle line:84%
if she's, oh, god,
everything bad happens to me,

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.590 align:middle line:84%
then she's going to
be affected by it.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise she wouldn't
have been affected by it.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's dive into
this a little bit deeper

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:37.990 align:middle line:90%
for a sec because this is huge.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: These are big topics.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a huge topic, yeah.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So looking around your
life and any events that

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:50.160 align:middle line:84%
have happened in your life
where you've either lost money,

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:84%
or you've lost a job,
or lost a relationship,

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.170 align:middle line:84%
look back into
those major events

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and see where my
belief system was

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:84%
around it that
matched what-- So I

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.900 align:middle line:84%
believed that those types of
things would have happen to me.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, that's right.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, we've been so
raised to believe

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:84%
in victim consciousness,
that there

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.960 align:middle line:84%
are things separate from us
that we have no control over.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Even the adage, well, you can't
control what happens to you,

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.450 align:middle line:84%
but you can control
how you react to it.

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:20.980 align:middle line:90%
That's even limiting.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.480 align:middle line:84%
When we finally get--
according to quantum physics,

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.080 align:middle line:90%
we're creating all of it.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.910 align:middle line:90%
We're not victims on any level.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't like
hearing that because they want

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.800 align:middle line:84%
to believe that there's victims,
or they think we're blaming.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like, it's not blame.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.060 align:middle line:84%
It's we're amazing
beings that have

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.650 align:middle line:90%
creative control over our lives.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.750 align:middle line:90%
We're creating everything.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.560 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's much
more exciting.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of the
phrases that irks me

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:47.000 align:middle line:84%
the most is this phrase, "oh,
what are you going to do?"

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.865 align:middle line:84%
I hate that phrase because
it's such a helpless phrase.

00:46:50.865 --> 00:46:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So is that
saying in me that there's

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.330 align:middle line:84%
something in me that's helpless
that I don't like about myself?

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, or it's
like if something happens

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.250 align:middle line:84%
on the outside and you
go, oh, doggone it.

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:03.458 align:middle line:84%
That happened to me, and I
had nothing to do with it.

00:47:03.458 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:84%
There's still a part
of you that believe--

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's
still a part of you.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yeah.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:07.800 align:middle line:90%
And we're still shifting.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.720 align:middle line:90%
We're shifting, Lisa.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:12.920 align:middle line:84%
We've been raised to believe
in an old basically Newtonian

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.310 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And quantum physics is
dramatically different.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It has dramatic statements
about the nature of reality,

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:21.750 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know it yet.

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:23.010 align:middle line:90%
We're not living it yet.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Although some of us are--
you're experimenting with it.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.790 align:middle line:90%
You're going, hey, look.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:84%
There's something
more to life that we

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.730 align:middle line:84%
haven't been trained
to believe in.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I experiment
with it all the time,

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.200 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't always work.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Right, but it's not
that it doesn't work.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It's that somehow there
was a subtle belief.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I use the expression
of it's a riptide where

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.410 align:middle line:84%
it looks like the waves
are going to the shore,

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:49.700 align:middle line:84%
but there's an undercurrent
pulling it back out.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a riptide.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But sometimes
those undercurrents

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.400 align:middle line:84%
are so subconscious that you
couldn't possibly know them

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.780 align:middle line:84%
until the outcome
doesn't happen.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.405 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right.

00:47:56.405 --> 00:47:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Right, and then we
get to look at it.

00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's the tricky part.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yeah, then
we get to look at it

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and go, all right,
where did my beliefs,

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.550 align:middle line:90%
what was my real belief here?

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.384 align:middle line:90%
Or where was my energy on this?

00:48:05.384 --> 00:48:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you had
given a step process.

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:09.400 align:middle line:84%
You said, find
out what irks you.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I like that, first step.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Then dig deep
inside and find out

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.900 align:middle line:84%
why do you believe
that that upsets you.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So that phrase, that one phrase,
what are you going to do?

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Why does that irk me?

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe
somewhere inside of me

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that that hopeless, helpless
feeling is somewhere in me.

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.305 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:48:31.305 --> 00:48:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Mm-hmm.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: And you don't like it.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:34.570 align:middle line:90%
You don't like it.

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.311 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't.

00:48:35.311 --> 00:48:36.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Because when
somebody says, oh well.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.040 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Part of you is like, well,
you can do something.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.020 align:middle line:90%
You can do something.

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So if it irks you, then there's
a conflict inside of you

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that goes, I know I can
create my own reality,

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.820 align:middle line:90%
and yet I don't always do it.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.870 align:middle line:90%
So that conflict is in there.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's very good.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it because that
you're psychic

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.340 align:middle line:90%
that you could see that?

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Can everybody see that?

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: Yes, we all
have these abilities.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.867 align:middle line:84%
It's like when people go, oh,
only certain people have a gift

00:49:04.867 --> 00:49:05.700 align:middle line:90%
and they're psychic.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I go, no, we all
have this ability.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.045 align:middle line:90%
We're just not using it.

00:49:10.045 --> 00:49:12.420 align:middle line:84%
We've all had experiences of
thinking of something and it

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.710 align:middle line:84%
happens, or knowing what's
going to happen on a TV show,

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:17.625 align:middle line:84%
or thinking about
someone and they call.

00:49:17.625 --> 00:49:18.875 align:middle line:90%
We've all had that experience.

00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:19.374 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:49:19.374 --> 00:49:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: It's just exercising
it to the next level.

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But people have to
believe it's possible.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But you're saying that
you can actually affect it.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.603 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just like you're the
observer in the experiment.

00:49:28.603 --> 00:49:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you can
think about somebody

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:36.299 align:middle line:84%
and imagine and visualize them
calling you, and days or so

00:49:36.299 --> 00:49:37.840 align:middle line:84%
would go by, and
they actually would.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Right.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So I have people ask me,
well, are you creating it,

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.590 align:middle line:84%
or are you psychically picking
up that it's going to happen?

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:46.530 align:middle line:84%
I believe based on what I'm
studying with quantum physics

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.560 align:middle line:90%
that we create it all.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.140 align:middle line:84%
We create everything,
and then psychically I

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.670 align:middle line:84%
pick up what I've
actually created,

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:55.360 align:middle line:84%
whether I was
conscious of it or not.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But in the case
of using somebody else,

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.630 align:middle line:84%
don't they have free will
to not follow the plan?

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: See, there's
parallel universes again.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:90%
There's parallel universes.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has infinite free will.

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But I align with
a universe where

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.060 align:middle line:90%
everybody's cooperating with me.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.650 align:middle line:10%
In other universes--
but they had free will

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.360 align:middle line:10%
to cooperate with
me in that one.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.420 align:middle line:10%
In another universe,
they have free will

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.210 align:middle line:10%
to do something
completely different.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
My friend who I'm with
now, in another universe,

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:84%
he's still living
on the East Coast.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:26.790 align:middle line:84%
In another one, he's
still with that same girl.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I see.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:28.551 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: He gets to
focus on-- that's

00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:30.090 align:middle line:84%
why I use the
analogy of TV sets.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you walk into
a department store

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.980 align:middle line:84%
or an electronics
store, and there's

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:38.200 align:middle line:84%
like 100 different TV shows
going on on their TV sets.

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.125 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to go
focus on one TV set,

00:50:41.125 --> 00:50:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and that can become
part of your reality.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.977 align:middle line:90%
But there's 100 TV sets.

00:50:45.977 --> 00:50:47.560 align:middle line:84%
You could go and
focus on any of them.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't affect the
actors in any of them.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.892 align:middle line:84%
Sandra Bullock could be
playing one role in this show,

00:50:52.892 --> 00:50:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and over here she's
playing another role.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And she's got free will
to focus on whichever one

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:58.320 align:middle line:90%
she wants, too.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.630 align:middle line:90%
We intersect with each other.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a complicated theory.

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:05.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a complicated concept.

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But I know it works because
we use it all the time.

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.170 align:middle line:84%
We just need to be conscious
that we're using it

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:11.960 align:middle line:90%
and become conscious creators.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, yes, and
the fact that you've

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.370 align:middle line:84%
opened our eyes to these
different universes

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and that you play in them,
I play in them just for fun.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I will do it with a lot more
intention and volition now

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.010 align:middle line:84%
because I know that
you can actually

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.510 align:middle line:84%
start to make some
significant change.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But I always
believed that it has

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.096 align:middle line:84%
to be for the good of
yourself, the good of others,

00:51:33.096 --> 00:51:34.220 align:middle line:90%
and the good of the planet.

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:35.594 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: OK, and
that's a belief.

00:51:35.594 --> 00:51:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a limiting belief,
but it's a belief.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.193 align:middle line:84%
And if you're happy
with that belief, great.

00:51:39.193 --> 00:51:40.040 align:middle line:90%
It works for you.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:44.820 align:middle line:10%
But also it's like, but it has
to be the good for everybody.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.420 align:middle line:10%
Oh my gosh, you would
totally limit yourself.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.102 align:middle line:10%
What if it's not good for--
what if you get a parking space,

00:51:50.102 --> 00:51:51.560 align:middle line:10%
but there are two
people back there

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.170 align:middle line:10%
that it would've been better for
them to get that parking space.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:56.639 align:middle line:90%
So you have to--

00:51:56.639 --> 00:51:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I have a belief
around selfishness, then.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
selfish about it.

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Yes.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:00.680 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.690 align:middle line:90%
But that's a belief.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.620 align:middle line:84%
If you have a belief that you're
a loving, magnanimous, amazing

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.340 align:middle line:84%
person, selfishness
doesn't even come into it.

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.012 align:middle line:84%
We've been trained to limit
ourselves by going, oh,

00:52:11.012 --> 00:52:12.220 align:middle line:90%
you could hurt somebody else.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's very selfish.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right, right.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:15.425 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: You shouldn't
love yourself that much.

00:52:15.425 --> 00:52:16.383 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh have I ever.

00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:19.144 align:middle line:90%
I was raised by nuns.

00:52:19.144 --> 00:52:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>OSLIE: The most
loving thing you

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.980 align:middle line:84%
could do for people
on this planet

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:84%
is to live full out and be the
most amazing being that you

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:26.480 align:middle line:90%
truly are.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.090 align:middle line:84%
That benefits everyone because
it gives everyone permission

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:29.730 align:middle line:90%
to be amazing.

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.813 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can maybe take
that to a little bit more

00:52:31.813 --> 00:52:33.515 align:middle line:90%
on the deserving side, maybe.

00:52:33.515 --> 00:52:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Thank you, Lisa.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You're wonderful.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much for
joining me today.

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OSLIE: Thanks.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.520 align:middle line:84%
This was a fun
conversation for me,

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.937 align:middle line:90%
so thank you for going there.

00:52:42.937 --> 00:52:45.145 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely, and I'm
sure people got a lot out

00:52:45.145 --> 00:52:45.670 align:middle line:90%
of it as well.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:47.961 align:middle line:84%
