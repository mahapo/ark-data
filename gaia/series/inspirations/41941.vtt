00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa Garr: Hi.

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:20.454 align:middle line:84%
This is Lisa Garr, host
of  Gaiam Inspirations .

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.156 align:middle line:84%
So how often have you
experienced something

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:25.126 align:middle line:84%
that goes wrong and you say
to yourself, "I knew that,"

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:26.994 align:middle line:84%
or, "I knew that was
going to happen?"

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is your
intuition talking to you.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:84%
How much do you live your
life by that intuition

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.703 align:middle line:84%
in your businesses
and your health?

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Joining me to talk about
intuition and natural success

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
is the author of The Magician's
Way and The Last Shaman ,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.311 align:middle line:90%
William Whitecloud. [laughter]

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.482 align:middle line:84%
I think I just called you
the last shaman, didn't I?

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.452 align:middle line:84%
>> William Whitecloud: Well,
it's a title I'm not adverse to.

00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:52.019 align:middle line:90%
That's okay.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:52.953 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Lisa.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How did
you get the title

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:55.489 align:middle line:90%
of your book, The Last Shaman ?

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: The title of
the book The Last Shaman ?

00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, the book The
Last Shaman basically conveys

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.433 align:middle line:84%
ideas about the fact
that really, in truth,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.371 align:middle line:84%
we're being guided through life,
if we are open to connecting

00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:12.506 align:middle line:84%
with that reality
and that truth.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, basically, it's
a function of intuition

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.346 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with
your intuition

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:23.984 align:middle line:84%
and then living life guided
by your intuition, basically.

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:27.388 align:middle line:84%
And so, I wanted to
convey this -- these ideas.

00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:31.125 align:middle line:84%
And I just -- I convey all
of my ideas through story, and

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:35.896 align:middle line:84%
I just really needed a story to
convey these particular ideas.

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:39.233 align:middle line:84%
And was in South Africa and
my brother introduced me

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:43.103 align:middle line:84%
to Africa's foremost
rock art expert,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.706 align:middle line:84%
a guy called Victor Biggs,
and he took my wife and I,

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:49.476 align:middle line:84%
Christian, out into the field
and was absolutely fascinating

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.646 align:middle line:84%
and he taught us all about
the Bushmen Paintings.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when I was
growing up, I saw them all

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.419 align:middle line:84%
over Africa and I thought --
we all thought, as white folk,

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:59.987 align:middle line:90%
you know, ignorant white folk,

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:02.489 align:middle line:84%
thought that they
depicted stories of hunting

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.925 align:middle line:84%
and tribal warfare
and all of that.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.594 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it's not true.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:10.331 align:middle line:84%
Every single piece of
rock art is a depiction

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
of a shamanic journey
into the other world.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, wow.

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:17.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And so, I
thought, you know, this is --

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:22.877 align:middle line:84%
and for the three purposes,
the purpose of gaining wisdom,

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:26.447 align:middle line:84%
making rain, and
also for healing.

00:02:26.447 --> 00:02:30.618 align:middle line:84%
And so, I thought this
would be a fantastic story

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:34.187 align:middle line:84%
if I could get my character
that I always use, Mark Vale,

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:37.157 align:middle line:84%
to go on one of these
journeys into the other world

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.359 align:middle line:90%
and then come back with --

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.928 align:middle line:84%
and through this journey
learn all this knowledge

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:42.263 align:middle line:90%
that I want to teach, you see?

00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:45.332 align:middle line:84%
And then, come back and
apply it in the world.

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:51.205 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's a story, therefore,
by these characters searching

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:54.141 align:middle line:84%
for mythical last
shaman, the last shaman...

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:54.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:55.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: of this tribe,

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.611 align:middle line:90%
and hence the title.

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:58.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah, I see.

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:59.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.581 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So now, you take people
on journeys through Africa and.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah. I do,

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:05.986 align:middle line:84%
and I take them on the Last
Shaman experience, basically,

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:09.623 align:middle line:84%
because I take them to this
region where I set my book.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:12.159 align:middle line:84%
I used the place where
I grew up in Africa

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.694 align:middle line:90%
as the setting of the book.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:14.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Which was in?

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: In Swaziland.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:18.465 align:middle line:84%
And I live in a very -- grew
up in a very interesting part

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:24.305 align:middle line:84%
of Africa and also
where I now take people.

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:25.639 align:middle line:90%
And it's this triangle.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the corner of South Africa,
Mozambique, and Swaziland.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.581 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting in
many ways, in the sense also

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:38.619 align:middle line:84%
that it's the end of the
Great Rift Valley of Africa,

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.687 align:middle line:84%
where we all sprung
from, I think.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.657 align:middle line:84%
That's -- you know, and where
we go, for instance, that is --

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:47.928 align:middle line:84%
they have found the second
oldest site of human habitation.

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:53.934 align:middle line:84%
So the atmosphere of the sense
of history there is incredible,

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:58.906 align:middle line:84%
as well as the wilderness
and the very special type

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:02.109 align:middle line:84%
of tribespeople that live
there and the wildlife.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.412 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it literally is
the wildest place on Earth.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.881 align:middle line:84%
It's most predator-rich
place on Earth.

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:13.253 align:middle line:84%
And so, it has incredible
energy, incredible atmosphere.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, I take people
back there, to the setting

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.729 align:middle line:84%
and take them through also
all these teachings that are

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.464 align:middle line:84%
in my book The Last
Shaman as well.

00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:25.499 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing experience.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:26.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.469 align:middle line:84%
So we have some pictures of
you on one of these journeys,

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.571 align:middle line:84%
these safaris, this
place of origin.

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:31.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yes.

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And I noticed that
the Jeep in the background,

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:38.645 align:middle line:84%
in comparison to these gigantic
animals, are these babies?

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:39.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.749 align:middle line:84%
These are babies,
blocking our road.

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.486 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't get past
them in this instance.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.388 align:middle line:90%
But it's just incredible.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:51.859 align:middle line:84%
You -- where we go
and when we go out,

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:54.595 align:middle line:84%
it's just an incredible
experience

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.498 align:middle line:84%
because these are not
tamed zoo animals.

00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:01.769 align:middle line:84%
They're really wild animals,
but they've been habituated

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:90%
to that type of vehicle.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.706 align:middle line:84%
So when that type
of vehicle comes by,

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:09.343 align:middle line:84%
they actually act as
if it's fresh air.

00:05:09.343 --> 00:05:11.044 align:middle line:84%
Their relationship
to it is fresh air.

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So you can get right
close to them

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.551 align:middle line:84%
so you can follow
big cats hunting,

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:21.155 align:middle line:90%
you know, mating, fighting.

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:22.189 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Is it like a show?

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:23.056 align:middle line:84%
It's like show time
when those Jeeps.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:24.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: It absolutely is.

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:24.658 align:middle line:90%
Because.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:25.959 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Because you
go out there and, you know,

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
the average person will
drive through that country

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
and just experience it as seeing
a random thing here and there.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.937 align:middle line:84%
But actually, when you stay
there for a while and you get

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:39.106 align:middle line:84%
to know the animals
and what's going on,

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle line:84%
there's this whole drama being
played out between them all.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:47.314 align:middle line:84%
And their characters and
personalities and power games

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:51.485 align:middle line:84%
and it's just like -- and -- the
most incredible show on Earth.

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:52.586 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: When you --
when you're out there,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
do you talk about how
this simulates life

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.791 align:middle line:84%
and how those dramas
play out in life?

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: The
relevance of that setting

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.498 align:middle line:84%
to what I teach people
is just simply this.

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:08.469 align:middle line:84%
Is that when we go
out there, this --

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.738 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere of this
place, which is made

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
up by the wilderness, the
land, the wild animals,

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.583 align:middle line:84%
and the people, very
authentic people, is that we go

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:24.718 align:middle line:90%
into a concept-free zone.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:90%
It's indescribable, really.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.456 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to describe
to the average person,

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:31.325 align:middle line:90%
but when you go there,

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:84%
you realize that actually
human beings accumulate a lot

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.466 align:middle line:84%
of concepts, a lot of constructs
that are very limiting.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:40.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Such as?

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: They're
just fixed constructs.

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:51.778 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, for instance,
I don't want to, you know,

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:56.283 align:middle line:84%
alienate anyone here, but
a very interesting thing is

00:06:56.283 --> 00:07:01.588 align:middle line:84%
that we inevitably on every trip
we go out on, we have vegans.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:07.628 align:middle line:84%
And to me, you know, vegans are
really the most rigid dietary

00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:09.863 align:middle line:84%
type in the sense
that, you know,

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:15.669 align:middle line:84%
they're very dedicated
to their philosophy.

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.805 align:middle line:84%
And it's nothing
against veganism here,

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.274 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm not getting
into trouble here,

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:23.544 align:middle line:84%
but it's just a fact
that every vegan

00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:26.246 align:middle line:90%
that we've taken has not lasted.

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:84%
They might have been practicing
for 16 years very rigidly

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.519 align:middle line:84%
and yet, when they come
into this situation,

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
their veganism lasts about three
days before they're eating all

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.991 align:middle line:84%
kinds of meat and
dairy products.

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because there's
nothing else to eat or because?

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: No.

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:41.962 align:middle line:90%
No. No. In fact, the opposite.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:45.365 align:middle line:84%
We go to a lot of trouble to
cater to their dietary needs,

00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.701 align:middle line:90%
you know, whatever they are.

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:50.237 align:middle line:84%
And it's not easy in these
remote parts of Africa,

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:51.872 align:middle line:90%
so we go to a lot of trouble.

00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:55.142 align:middle line:84%
And in spite of all the trouble
we go to, it's just, you know,

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:58.745 align:middle line:84%
whatever causes people to
espouse, whatever theories

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:02.182 align:middle line:84%
that they hold, pet theories
and notions they have,

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:04.184 align:middle line:90%
they just fall off people.

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:05.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:07.154 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Like
water melting off them,

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.923 align:middle line:90%
drying off them in the sun.

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it's an environment
where, as I said,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.228 align:middle line:90%
it's a concept-free zone.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.697 align:middle line:90%
Your concepts of life...

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:17.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Interesting.

00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:18.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: ...can't survive.

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:21.902 align:middle line:84%
So only what is really
authentic to you survives,

00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:25.072 align:middle line:84%
and that is what is most
relevant about the setting.

00:08:25.072 --> 00:08:26.473 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible setting.

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:30.043 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone ever wants
to come back to themselves

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and just experience themselves
for who they really are

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and experience life just
for what it is and have

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:90%
that raw connection to life...

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.354 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...this
is the thing to do.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.356 align:middle line:90%
This is the place to go to.

00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:43.991 align:middle line:90%
It does that to people, really.

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:46.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I love this
picture of the giraffes

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:48.595 align:middle line:90%
and how the people are...

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:49.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Ah, yes.

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:50.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...so close
to the giraffes.

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:56.269 align:middle line:84%
But when you see something that
massive and beautiful right next

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.805 align:middle line:84%
to you, it really does have
to blow your constructs of.

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: When you
see it on TV, I was just --

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.209 align:middle line:84%
someone was just saying this
to me on Facebook today,

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.511 align:middle line:84%
because they're responding to
a picture I had up on Facebook,

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "I know
what you're talking

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.581 align:middle line:90%
about here, William.

00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:09.216 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're showing
us because I was there."

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:10.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah.

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:12.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And when you see
this on TV, it looks so great

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.854 align:middle line:84%
and all that, but
when you're there,

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:15.722 align:middle line:90%
it just takes your breath away.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.725 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance, these
giraffes here, I mean,

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.227 align:middle line:90%
where we go, they're everywhere

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:22.562 align:middle line:84%
and they call them the
dolphins of the land.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
They're just -- they're energy's
like dolphinic, you know?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.236 align:middle line:90%
And we will be -- they're wild.

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:90%
They're not tame.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.506 align:middle line:84%
But we'll be swimming
in these swimming pools

00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:35.342 align:middle line:84%
out in the bush cooling
off and they'll just walk

00:09:35.342 --> 00:09:38.145 align:middle line:84%
out of the bush and come and
have a drink out of the pool

00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:39.112 align:middle line:90%
that you're swimming in.

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:40.814 align:middle line:84%
Or you go for a walk
through the bush

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:45.285 align:middle line:84%
and you hear these feet clopping
behind you and you look around

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:47.321 align:middle line:84%
and there's a giraffe
following you through the bush.

00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:49.289 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you
stop, it stops

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:51.358 align:middle line:84%
and when you carry
on, it carries on.

00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:52.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So they're playful.

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Ah,
they're very playful,

00:09:53.527 --> 00:09:55.562 align:middle line:84%
and inquisitive as
well, you see.

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:56.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:59.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And,
you know, as you say,

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:00.534 align:middle line:90%
it's breathtaking and just so...

00:10:00.534 --> 00:10:01.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That.

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:04.971 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...awe-inspiring
and just clears your mind

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:08.141 align:middle line:84%
of everything that
you've ever held before.

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:12.012 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, everyone out
there in the world's trying

00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:14.881 align:middle line:84%
to follow all these spiritual
ideas about, you know,

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:17.351 align:middle line:84%
being in the moment
and being present

00:10:17.351 --> 00:10:19.052 align:middle line:90%
and coming back to themselves.

00:10:19.052 --> 00:10:22.289 align:middle line:84%
But you just go there and
it just does it to you.

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:23.724 align:middle line:90%
It's -- it takes you prisoner

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:25.759 align:middle line:84%
and you have no other
way of being.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:26.693 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:27.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It strips
away everything.

00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:28.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: And also,

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:31.198 align:middle line:84%
the thing about it is also
the learning environment,

00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:34.634 align:middle line:84%
your ability then to
absorb teachings and relate

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:38.705 align:middle line:84%
to them is enhanced, you know,
to the power of a thousand.

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:39.906 align:middle line:90%
It really is great.

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:41.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Tell me a
little bit about --

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:44.211 align:middle line:84%
take me back to your
childhood and growing up.

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:48.315 align:middle line:84%
You had developed quite a
serious illness, as I remember.

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well,
actually, in adulthood.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: In adulthood?

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:51.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:52.953 align:middle line:90%
In adulthood.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:56.223 align:middle line:84%
I had a 10-year illness
that took me

00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:90%
to my deathbed literally.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.192 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was receiving
deathbed counseling.

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:03.029 align:middle line:90%
I was really in a bad way.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.031 align:middle line:90%
And the intriguing thing

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:07.501 align:middle line:84%
about the illness was
it was undiagnosed.

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:08.468 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knew what was.

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:09.803 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: What were the symptoms?

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: You know, I
mean, I remember doing a test

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.343 align:middle line:84%
that listed 200 symptoms and
I had them all, you know,

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.411 align:middle line:84%
from tension headaches
and nausea

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:21.248 align:middle line:90%
to memory loss, poor vision.

00:11:21.248 --> 00:11:22.582 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you name it.

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:25.652 align:middle line:90%
Sores all over me, weight loss.

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:27.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How old were you?

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:30.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: It occurred
my mid-20s to my mid-30s.

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:31.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh, wow.

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:32.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:32.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: So young.

00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:33.193 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:33.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:34.761 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:35.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you didn't
-- it wasn't a virus,

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:36.663 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't -- it was diagnosed.

00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:37.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: I don't
know what it was.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.167 align:middle line:84%
It could have been --
who knows what it was,

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:42.969 align:middle line:84%
but it was never
diagnosed and as a result,

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:45.605 align:middle line:90%
no cure was ever prescribed.

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:52.078 align:middle line:84%
And -- but I did meet a person
10 years down the track,

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:90%
actually, who really, when --

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.884 align:middle line:84%
I had just received the deathbed
counseling session a day

00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:00.921 align:middle line:84%
or two before, and
being persuaded

00:12:00.921 --> 00:12:04.691 align:middle line:84%
by this little old lady with,
you know, white hair to go --

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.160 align:middle line:84%
not fear anything and
go towards the light.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
She was encouraging me to
let go of my mortal coil

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.232 align:middle line:90%
and allow myself to die.

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And just a
couple of days after that,

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:21.141 align:middle line:84%
I somehow had enough energy
to go outside and I met a guy,

00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:22.742 align:middle line:84%
a stranger, who I
got talking to.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.313 align:middle line:84%
And because of my health,
very obviously the --

00:12:26.313 --> 00:12:27.881 align:middle line:90%
my situation, very obviously,

00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:31.151 align:middle line:84%
the conversation turned
quickly to my health.

00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:34.054 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, he could have
knocked me down with a feather

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
because the first person
in 10 years, he said,

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.225 align:middle line:90%
"I know what's wrong with you.

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:40.227 align:middle line:84%
And not only do I know
what's wrong with you,

00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:43.029 align:middle line:84%
but I also have the
cure for you"

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Where were you?

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.398 align:middle line:90%
What country?

00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:46.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: In Australia.

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:46.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Australia.

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:54.174 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, he -- from
what he described to me,

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:57.377 align:middle line:84%
I was in no doubt whatsoever
that he had had what I had

00:12:57.377 --> 00:12:59.913 align:middle line:84%
because he was describing
my condition to me,

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
which I had been absolutely
unable to relate to anyone,

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.952 align:middle line:84%
whether they were psychiatrists
or doctors or family.

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:07.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:09.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Just nobody
could appreciate what I was

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:90%
going through.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.193 align:middle line:84%
And here was a guy telling
me what he had experienced

00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:14.394 align:middle line:90%
and suffered.

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:16.596 align:middle line:84%
And I believed him
without a doubt

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:17.964 align:middle line:90%
that he had had what I had.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:22.168 align:middle line:84%
And so, then he told me the
cure was for me to eat red meat

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.639 align:middle line:84%
and drink white wine and smoke
a few cigarettes every day

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.307 align:middle line:84%
and have a few cups
of coffee every day.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:32.712 align:middle line:84%
And he said if I did that,
I'd be fine very quickly.

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:34.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And the -- and you did?

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:35.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:37.117 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't
got time here today.

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:40.253 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time for me to go
into how confronting this was

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:84%
to me, because that was anathema
to everything I had been told

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.427 align:middle line:84%
and had been eliminated
from my thinking,

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:50.597 align:middle line:90%
nevermind my intake, ages ago.

00:13:50.597 --> 00:13:55.368 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I overcame
that because, you know,

00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:57.704 align:middle line:84%
various reasons,
among them being

00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:00.807 align:middle line:84%
that he was the only person
I had related to in 10 years

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:03.843 align:middle line:84%
and I had some connection
to him.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:04.611 align:middle line:90%
But I did.

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:05.979 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:07.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Had you been a vegan
or vegetarian prior to that?

00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:08.181 align:middle line:90%
Or?

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: No.

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:11.918 align:middle line:84%
No. But, I mean, all --
because of my health situation

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:16.523 align:middle line:84%
and because of the advice I had
received, obviously, you know,

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:20.827 align:middle line:90%
you put on -- it's very typical.

00:14:20.827 --> 00:14:22.862 align:middle line:84%
Whenever something like that is
wrong with you, you'll be put

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.731 align:middle line:90%
on vitamins, you'll be told to.

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:25.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Diet.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:26.466 align:middle line:90%
Change your diet.

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:27.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Change
your diet, you know.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:33.173 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol, nicotine, caffeine; all
of those things are no go zones.

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:37.143 align:middle line:84%
And so, for years, I hadn't
touched anything like that

00:14:37.143 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and believed that if
I did, I would die.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Die.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.147 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:42.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:44.751 align:middle line:84%
And so, I threw all caution
to the wind and I took him

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:47.253 align:middle line:84%
up on his prescription
and I did.

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:49.122 align:middle line:90%
I got well instantly.

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:51.691 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, you
-- because you think --

00:14:51.691 --> 00:14:55.195 align:middle line:84%
if you go downhill over
10 years to a point

00:14:55.195 --> 00:14:58.865 align:middle line:84%
where you reach your deathbed,
you think that if ever you find

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:02.769 align:middle line:84%
out what's wrong with you
and you find the cure,

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:04.804 align:middle line:84%
it'll take years for
you to come back.

00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:07.407 align:middle line:84%
But I came back in, you
know, literally days.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:08.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Days.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Days.

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:11.344 align:middle line:84%
It took me months to put back
all the weight and all of that,

00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:15.348 align:middle line:84%
but my mental faculties and,
you know, my wits and everything

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:19.486 align:middle line:84%
that I had lost, just -- my
energy was just back in days.

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:22.789 align:middle line:84%
I mean, within a week I
was bouncing around looking

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:24.024 align:middle line:90%
for a soccer game to join in.

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:26.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: How did you
transition from this illness

00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:28.395 align:middle line:90%
into then becoming a teacher?

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:31.865 align:middle line:90%
How did you bridge that gap?

00:15:31.865 --> 00:15:33.733 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well,
very easily.

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:37.337 align:middle line:84%
Because when I recovered
from my illness,

00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:41.341 align:middle line:84%
I thought about my recovery
a lot, as you can imagine.

00:15:41.341 --> 00:15:42.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: It
preoccupied all of my thinking.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.247 align:middle line:84%
And when I thought
about it, it never --

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:51.651 align:middle line:84%
I never believed really for
a minute that it had anything

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:56.723 align:middle line:84%
to do with the prescription,
with the meat or the alcohol

00:15:56.723 --> 00:15:59.926 align:middle line:90%
or the nicotine or the caffeine.

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:06.399 align:middle line:84%
What dawned on me, and I never
thought about this before,

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:09.602 align:middle line:84%
because I had grown up in the
bush in Africa and I didn't know

00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:12.672 align:middle line:84%
that you could string the words
personal and development...

00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Together?

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...or spiritual
or development together.

00:16:15.075 --> 00:16:16.376 align:middle line:90%
You know, I didn't know.

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:16.943 align:middle line:90%
I mean...

00:16:16.943 --> 00:16:18.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...even back
then, Deepak Chopra and people

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:22.348 align:middle line:84%
like that were starting
to emerge.

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:26.653 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I had never come
across that kind of thinking.

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:30.824 align:middle line:84%
And -- but what occurred
to me just

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:36.663 align:middle line:84%
so powerfully was there must
be some way in which I focus

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:84%
or that I think that then
affects my experience of life.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.772 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd just been so focused
on being ill and trying to

00:16:45.772 --> 00:16:47.941 align:middle line:84%
better, but really, the
focus was being ill.

00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:51.878 align:middle line:84%
And so, I just got more
and more and more ill.

00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:56.182 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I just, you know,
by taking up that prescription,

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:59.052 align:middle line:84%
what I really did was just
went, you know, what the hell?

00:16:59.052 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't care anymore.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.422 align:middle line:84%
And I just got better
immediately.

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And whether it was the right
conclusion to make

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.493 align:middle line:90%
or the wrong conclusion,

00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:10.496 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know because
people argue with me about that

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:12.465 align:middle line:90%
and I don't have any argument.

00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:13.867 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:17.637 align:middle line:84%
It's just the conclusion I made
as a result of that experience.

00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:23.243 align:middle line:84%
And so, then, I was dedicated,
became obsessed in a way,

00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:26.012 align:middle line:84%
of finding out how
this principle worked

00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:28.214 align:middle line:84%
because it just was a
vague idea in my mind.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:32.318 align:middle line:84%
So how does this principle
work so that I could --

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:35.221 align:middle line:84%
that I can use it formally
to create my heaven

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.956 align:middle line:84%
on Earth instead of
this hell on Earth

00:17:36.956 --> 00:17:38.558 align:middle line:90%
that I had just been through.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And the
principle being?

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well, that your
focus creates your reality,

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:42.829 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:17:42.829 --> 00:17:44.864 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
have that language.

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, of all the
people in the world,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.169 align:middle line:84%
my accountant gave me that
phrase.

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:54.307 align:middle line:84%
Because I was trying to explain
to him my insight and he said

00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:56.276 align:middle line:90%
to me, "Oh, so you're telling me

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:58.945 align:middle line:84%
that our focus creates
our reality?"

00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.046 align:middle line:90%
I nearly hugged him.

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:02.382 align:middle line:84%
I was going, "That's
exactly what I mean."

00:18:02.382 --> 00:18:03.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Oh.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:03.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: You see?

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:04.517 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:05.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So he fed
that back to you.

00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:06.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Exactly.

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:07.921 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, my
accountant of all people.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.189 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:11.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And he told
me about courses and books

00:18:11.858 --> 00:18:14.027 align:middle line:84%
that I could read and
courses that I could do,

00:18:14.027 --> 00:18:15.395 align:middle line:90%
which I didn't know existed.

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:17.697 align:middle line:90%
And so, I began an investigation

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:21.167 align:middle line:84%
of this whole idea
and this whole field.

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:26.005 align:middle line:84%
And what it led me to
instantly was alchemy.

00:18:26.005 --> 00:18:29.909 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's what I
followed for the last 20 years,

00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:33.112 align:middle line:84%
is my investigation
and study and practice

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:37.183 align:middle line:84%
and teachings all center around
basically the philosophies

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:39.319 align:middle line:90%
of hermetic philosophy.

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:40.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Which is alchemy.

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:41.888 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:44.958 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well, hermetic
philosophy is a strand

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:48.695 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy, which
I've since discovered.

00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:50.964 align:middle line:84%
I'm blessed that I was led
straight to it, I think,

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:54.701 align:middle line:84%
because I've since discovered
that, you know, academics

00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:57.804 align:middle line:84%
and philosophers and
mythologists all consider it

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.707 align:middle line:84%
to be the alchemy
par excellence.

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:04.143 align:middle line:84%
And so, it, you know, it's
a mind science basically.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:10.617 align:middle line:84%
And it really teaches
us about how focus --

00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:12.518 align:middle line:84%
our focus does create
our reality

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:16.422 align:middle line:84%
and how we can pay
attention in a way

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:18.992 align:middle line:84%
that we can create what
matters to us in life.

00:19:18.992 --> 00:19:20.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So explain
what alchemy is

00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:22.161 align:middle line:90%
for people that might not know.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:25.365 align:middle line:84%
It's got an incredibly
transformative power, yes?

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:26.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:19:26.232 --> 00:19:29.402 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I
think it's going

00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:31.471 align:middle line:84%
to be an interesting
time ahead of us

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:36.776 align:middle line:84%
where I think alchemy
will come to be explained

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:41.047 align:middle line:84%
in its true nature
and true form.

00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:44.584 align:middle line:84%
Because I think people
think of alchemy in a sort

00:19:44.584 --> 00:19:49.689 align:middle line:84%
of very mystic, hooey, kind
of way; in a very cliched,

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:53.293 align:middle line:84%
symbolic way where you've
got this idea about that,

00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:55.862 align:middle line:90%
in one sense, it's a chemical --

00:19:55.862 --> 00:20:00.133 align:middle line:84%
it's about transforming literal
materials of lead into gold.

00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Lead into gold.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.834 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. That's right.

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:02.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Or
something like that.

00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.041 align:middle line:84%
It's, you know, the lead is
just a metaphor for our kind

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:13.646 align:middle line:84%
of lower egoic nature and the
gold is higher authentic nature

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:18.318 align:middle line:84%
or personal genius that
we can all achieve really.

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:22.822 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you don't really
hear much about it at all.

00:20:22.822 --> 00:20:29.395 align:middle line:84%
But I've never seen it anywhere
really publically in any kind

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:33.199 align:middle line:84%
of story or book
or any form really.

00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:39.706 align:middle line:84%
But the essence of
alchemy is a principle --

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:45.812 align:middle line:84%
the principles of nigredo,
albedo, and rubedo,

00:20:45.812 --> 00:20:48.815 align:middle line:84%
which is black, white,
and red, basically.

00:20:48.815 --> 00:20:53.186 align:middle line:84%
And you see, it's all about
making the fixed volatile

00:20:53.186 --> 00:20:55.021 align:middle line:84%
and the volatile
fixed, which means --

00:20:55.021 --> 00:20:58.358 align:middle line:84%
let me just explain quickly,
make sense of this very soon.

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:04.831 align:middle line:84%
Is that nigredo is our dense
self, our fixed egoic structure,

00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
our sense of, you know,
belief system and all

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.739 align:middle line:90%
of that, our concepts.

00:21:12.739 --> 00:21:16.542 align:middle line:84%
And yeah. Just limited
perceptions

00:21:16.542 --> 00:21:18.611 align:middle line:90%
of life that we have.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.714 align:middle line:84%
And so, alchemy -- what alchemy
is about is about breaking

00:21:21.714 --> 00:21:24.283 align:middle line:84%
that down, making
the fixed volatile.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So breaking that down and
escaping that and rising

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.956 align:middle line:84%
up into the light,
into the white,

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.158 align:middle line:84%
which is our intuition,
basically.

00:21:32.158 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:90%
It is our higher consciousness.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.399 align:middle line:84%
And then, being able to have
a perspective from that place

00:21:39.399 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and being able to see the light,
as it were, and being able

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.839 align:middle line:84%
to operate from that
higher perspective.

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:52.912 align:middle line:84%
And then, the rubedo is the
red, which is the color of Mars.

00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:84%
It's this -- it's the masculine
will so that we then --

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.153 align:middle line:84%
we break down our egoic
way of seeing things,

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:05.525 align:middle line:84%
rise up to our intuition, and
see the higher perspective,

00:22:05.525 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
which is, you know, conflicts
with our egoic perception.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:16.069 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we have to
have a will to actually claim

00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:20.506 align:middle line:84%
that dream-like perception,
insight as our reality

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:22.141 align:middle line:90%
and follow through on that.

00:22:22.141 --> 00:22:23.376 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:22:23.376 --> 00:22:24.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And so,
basically, you know, really,

00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:28.314 align:middle line:84%
in a nutshell, although there's
a whole science

00:22:28.314 --> 00:22:29.916 align:middle line:90%
and art behind it,

00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:35.588 align:middle line:84%
but in a nutshell, that is the
art or the science of alchemy.

00:22:35.588 --> 00:22:38.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So it applies
to everything in life.

00:22:38.124 --> 00:22:39.759 align:middle line:90%
I can see how you got

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:42.128 align:middle line:84%
to teaching something
called natural success,

00:22:42.128 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to
talk a little bit about,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.732 align:middle line:90%
is how to take the --

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:49.235 align:middle line:84%
how to transform
something in the physical,

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:51.771 align:middle line:84%
but really using the
magic of the universe

00:22:51.771 --> 00:22:53.239 align:middle line:90%
in order to make it happen.

00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:56.209 align:middle line:84%
Not even the magic of the
universe, but other dimensions

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:58.344 align:middle line:90%
in order to make it happen.

00:22:58.344 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:84%
This is something that I've
been exploring myself recently.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So tell me about
how this applies

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.686 align:middle line:84%
to what you call
natural success.

00:23:06.686 --> 00:23:11.557 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well, thank you
for giving me the opportunity

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:13.926 align:middle line:84%
because it's my favorite
subject to talk about.

00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:16.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, it's
a great title.

00:23:16.095 --> 00:23:17.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Natural success.

00:23:17.163 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:23.569 align:middle line:84%
You see, typically, I
think, the kind of success

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:26.606 align:middle line:84%
that I see largely
being attained

00:23:26.606 --> 00:23:28.941 align:middle line:84%
in the world is achievement
that --

00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:31.978 align:middle line:84%
and the type of success that
I call high achievement,

00:23:31.978 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
which comes from a lot of
effort and hard work...

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Will.

00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:36.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...and
willfulness...

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:37.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: ...and, you know.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:39.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: You could
even say effort and struggle.

00:23:39.886 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Whereas,
you know,

00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:44.056 align:middle line:84%
and that's one kind
of achievement.

00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:47.827 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of a,
you know, in a sense,

00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:51.397 align:middle line:90%
a pigheaded type of approach.

00:23:51.397 --> 00:23:53.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Well, it's how
businesses are structured

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:53.766 align:middle line:90%
these days...

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:54.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:23:54.634 --> 00:23:55.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: ...with
graphs and goals

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.637 align:middle line:90%
and projections and -- yeah.

00:23:57.637 --> 00:23:58.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:23:58.704 --> 00:23:59.805 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's
not only businesses.

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:02.608 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of personal
achievements as well,

00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:06.178 align:middle line:84%
and our approach
to relationships

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:07.947 align:middle line:90%
for just life in general.

00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:08.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: True.

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:10.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: But you see,

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:16.489 align:middle line:84%
what I mean by natural success
is a success that's achieved

00:24:16.489 --> 00:24:18.524 align:middle line:90%
through creativity.

00:24:18.524 --> 00:24:25.164 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And, you know,
creativity, by any definition,

00:24:25.164 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
really you could distill down to
the ability to make connections

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.939 align:middle line:90%
that aren't usually made.

00:24:32.939 --> 00:24:37.243 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think about
any genius who invents

00:24:37.243 --> 00:24:45.017 align:middle line:84%
or creates anything, whether
it's Andy Warhol, who does,

00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:48.187 align:middle line:84%
you know, incredible silk
screens that are different

00:24:48.187 --> 00:24:51.357 align:middle line:84%
to anything that's ever been
done before, or takes a can

00:24:51.357 --> 00:24:53.726 align:middle line:84%
of soup and makes
something iconic out of it.

00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:54.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:24:54.794 --> 00:24:56.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Or
whether it's Einstein,

00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:59.131 align:middle line:84%
who figures out there are black
holes in space before there are

00:24:59.131 --> 00:25:03.269 align:middle line:84%
radio telescopes that
can identify them.

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:06.505 align:middle line:84%
You see, they're making
connections that...

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...the
average person isn't making.

00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:09.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: At the stratospheric
level.

00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:10.076 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:25:10.076 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And
so, when one breaks

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.083 align:middle line:84%
out of one's normal
patterned way of thinking,

00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:18.784 align:middle line:90%
you start making connections

00:25:18.784 --> 00:25:23.723 align:middle line:84%
that then start making life
a whole lot more effortless

00:25:23.723 --> 00:25:25.992 align:middle line:90%
and effective as well.

00:25:25.992 --> 00:25:31.797 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, the way
the conditioned mind works,

00:25:31.797 --> 00:25:38.404 align:middle line:84%
it gets from A to B by going to
C to D to E to F to G to H to I

00:25:38.404 --> 00:25:40.773 align:middle line:90%
to J to K, and back around...

00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:41.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:42.241 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: ...Z and back to.

00:25:42.241 --> 00:25:42.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Details.

00:25:42.908 --> 00:25:43.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:25:43.576 --> 00:25:44.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Absolutely.

00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: And.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:49.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And when you go
into your more creative mind,

00:25:49.115 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
you just -- you start
seeing through all of that

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.752 align:middle line:90%
and you see a lot more directly.

00:25:52.752 --> 00:25:58.591 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing just how
much more directly you can go

00:25:58.591 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and you start going
from A to B, from --

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.129 align:middle line:84%
literally from A to B a
whole lot more directly.

00:26:03.129 --> 00:26:05.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: This is so
interesting to me because it's

00:26:05.164 --> 00:26:08.334 align:middle line:84%
about creating an
entirely different level.

00:26:08.334 --> 00:26:08.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: It is.

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:10.136 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:11.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I always used to
see that phrase of creating

00:26:11.404 --> 00:26:13.673 align:middle line:84%
with ease and effortlessness,
and I used to say how

00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:14.874 align:middle line:90%
on Earth does that happen?

00:26:14.874 --> 00:26:16.475 align:middle line:84%
You need to do this, this,
you have to work hard.

00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:16.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:26:16.976 --> 00:26:17.743 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:18.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You have to do --

00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:20.446 align:middle line:84%
and it's a completely
different level

00:26:20.446 --> 00:26:23.249 align:middle line:84%
of creating far more
successfully

00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:90%
and far more easily...

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:25.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Easily.

00:26:25.484 --> 00:26:26.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ...

00:26:26.018 --> 00:26:26.786 align:middle line:90%
on the body.

00:26:26.786 --> 00:26:27.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Absolutely.

00:26:27.486 --> 00:26:28.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And the mind.

00:26:28.621 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a list of people
here that you say are

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:35.394 align:middle line:84%
in your category of natural
success here in terms of genius.

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:37.863 align:middle line:84%
How do you define
the word genius?

00:26:37.863 --> 00:26:40.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well, you
see, that list there is just

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:43.569 align:middle line:90%
to help people that I teach see

00:26:43.569 --> 00:26:45.771 align:middle line:84%
that they're all
different kinds of geniuses.

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:46.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: You see?

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.609 align:middle line:84%
So otherwise, they might be
just sitting there with an idea

00:26:50.609 --> 00:26:52.778 align:middle line:84%
that Albert Einstein
is a genius.

00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:56.248 align:middle line:84%
But Albert Einstein himself
said everyone is a genius,

00:26:56.248 --> 00:27:01.220 align:middle line:84%
but if you, you know, try and
teach a fish to climb a tree,

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.922 align:middle line:84%
it's going to think
that it's a fool.

00:27:02.922 --> 00:27:06.192 align:middle line:84%
It has its own nature
and its own genius,

00:27:06.192 --> 00:27:06.992 align:middle line:90%
you know, which is true.

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:08.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:27:08.327 --> 00:27:09.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: If you are out in
nature, you see that all --

00:27:09.395 --> 00:27:11.464 align:middle line:84%
everything, every
creature, has a genius.

00:27:11.464 --> 00:27:13.566 align:middle line:90%
And so, we're all geniuses.

00:27:13.566 --> 00:27:15.501 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I have that list.

00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:19.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What is the definition
of genius in your opinion?

00:27:19.672 --> 00:27:22.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well, this
is what I wanted to say

00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:27.446 align:middle line:84%
about genius, is that if
you look at the levels

00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:32.885 align:middle line:84%
of creativity, you have
a whole lot of levels

00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:38.591 align:middle line:84%
like low level imitation,
high level imitation,

00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:41.093 align:middle line:84%
low level derivative,
high level derivative.

00:27:41.093 --> 00:27:43.729 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have
innovative, inventive,

00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:44.997 align:middle line:90%
and then you have genius.

00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:46.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Okay.

00:27:46.132 --> 00:27:47.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And so,
what the lower levels

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:50.136 align:middle line:84%
of creativity all
have in common is

00:27:50.136 --> 00:27:53.839 align:middle line:84%
that they copy something
or somebody else.

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:57.176 align:middle line:84%
It's where you're being
informed by something else,

00:27:57.176 --> 00:27:59.512 align:middle line:84%
something with somebody
outside of yourself,

00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:03.716 align:middle line:84%
where you're conforming to
preexisting rules, basically.

00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:06.085 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you start getting
into, and this is just --

00:28:06.085 --> 00:28:09.188 align:middle line:84%
these are academic ideas on the
subject, when you start getting

00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:13.125 align:middle line:84%
into innovative inventive,
you start breaking those rules

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:15.261 align:middle line:90%
and start being self-referenced.

00:28:15.261 --> 00:28:20.065 align:middle line:84%
And genius, by my definition,
is just simply whereby the --

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:21.634 align:middle line:90%
you throw away all the rules.

00:28:21.634 --> 00:28:23.269 align:middle line:90%
You just totally self-reference.

00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:26.572 align:middle line:84%
Like Immanuel Kant defined
a genius as somebody

00:28:26.572 --> 00:28:28.707 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't have to
be taught anything.

00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:30.709 align:middle line:84%
It's not somebody who
hasn't learned anything,

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:35.781 align:middle line:84%
but they make it up totally
by themselves for themselves.

00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:38.617 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see -- so
then, you'll see someone

00:28:38.617 --> 00:28:40.186 align:middle line:84%
like Richard Branson
in business.

00:28:40.186 --> 00:28:42.655 align:middle line:84%
He's a genius because he
hasn't followed any rules.

00:28:42.655 --> 00:28:44.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:45.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: He hasn't gone
to business school or anything.

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:47.092 align:middle line:84%
He's made the game
up for himself.

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I find this a very
progressive conversation.

00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:50.963 align:middle line:90%
I just saw this piece on Youtube

00:28:50.963 --> 00:28:53.966 align:middle line:84%
with this 13-year-old kid
talking about hack schooling

00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:56.535 align:middle line:84%
and how hack schooling is
something that's been created.

00:28:56.535 --> 00:28:58.971 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
alternative way of learning

00:28:58.971 --> 00:29:02.274 align:middle line:84%
and there's a day spent on
math and there's a day spent

00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
on spiritual growth and there's
a day spent on technology,

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.915 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a day spent
on nature, and they combine --

00:29:09.915 --> 00:29:13.018 align:middle line:84%
these are your five days of the
week of your educational

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:18.123 align:middle line:84%
program. And it's like a
self-formed way of education.

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:21.894 align:middle line:84%
This 13-year-old that spoke, I
mean, you could YouTube this,

00:29:21.894 --> 00:29:24.296 align:middle line:90%
he was incredibly eloquent.

00:29:24.296 --> 00:29:26.899 align:middle line:90%
He was so in touch with himself.

00:29:26.899 --> 00:29:31.003 align:middle line:84%
He could give a complete speech
without notes and he was very --

00:29:31.003 --> 00:29:33.706 align:middle line:90%
a very centered 13-year-old.

00:29:33.706 --> 00:29:34.473 align:middle line:90%
And this is.

00:29:34.473 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: The genius.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.808 align:middle line:90%
A genius. Yeah.

00:29:35.808 --> 00:29:36.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: He was a genius.

00:29:36.342 --> 00:29:37.877 align:middle line:90%
Yes. At 13.

00:29:37.877 --> 00:29:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And to have that type of -- the
perspective that he had and --

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.716 align:middle line:84%
oh, the bottom line
about his teaching?

00:29:43.716 --> 00:29:46.051 align:middle line:84%
His teaching at 13
was about being happy

00:29:46.051 --> 00:29:49.288 align:middle line:84%
and that he didn't want
to achieve the, you know,

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the typical job in
order to be happy.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:55.527 align:middle line:84%
His goal was to be happy while
the process was happening.

00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:56.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Amazing.

00:29:56.729 --> 00:29:57.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Not to get to
that process of happiness,

00:29:57.696 --> 00:30:00.132 align:middle line:90%
but to be happy in that moment.

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:02.735 align:middle line:84%
And compared to, you
know, friends of his

00:30:02.735 --> 00:30:05.838 align:middle line:90%
that were not happy at 13 --

00:30:05.838 --> 00:30:08.908 align:middle line:84%
bottom line is, there are
different types of geniuses

00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:11.877 align:middle line:84%
and I think the progressive age
that we're in, with technology

00:30:11.877 --> 00:30:13.112 align:middle line:90%
and how things are speeding up,

00:30:13.112 --> 00:30:16.181 align:middle line:84%
this type of genius is
what's required these days.

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:16.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Well, yeah.

00:30:16.682 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:18.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It's not necessarily
the traditional type...

00:30:18.751 --> 00:30:19.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: It really is.

00:30:19.385 --> 00:30:19.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ...of it.

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.186 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: I mean -- and
it's not going to help you --

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:24.323 align:middle line:84%
the current education, which
is the traditional education,

00:30:24.323 --> 00:30:26.258 align:middle line:90%
isn't helping anybody really.

00:30:26.258 --> 00:30:27.559 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:31.463 align:middle line:84%
You raised the whole idea
of education and the specter

00:30:31.463 --> 00:30:36.335 align:middle line:84%
of education, actually, because,
you see, education's derived,

00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:38.137 align:middle line:84%
as you most probably
know, Lisa, it's derived

00:30:38.137 --> 00:30:42.007 align:middle line:84%
from the word educare,
which means to bring out of,

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:45.077 align:middle line:84%
to draw forth, bring out
of, draw out of, actually.

00:30:45.077 --> 00:30:48.314 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
Latin phrase, word.

00:30:48.314 --> 00:30:53.619 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, that implies
that in each one of us,

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:57.723 align:middle line:84%
there is something, a
preexisting wisdom, knowledge,

00:30:57.723 --> 00:31:01.827 align:middle line:84%
talent, ability, that is
meant to be drawn out of us

00:31:01.827 --> 00:31:06.432 align:middle line:84%
that is then what we're going
to really mainly rely to get

00:31:06.432 --> 00:31:08.334 align:middle line:84%
through life,
to manage in life.

00:31:08.334 --> 00:31:09.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:31:09.635 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And yet, they
should invent another word

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.838 align:middle line:90%
for the current education system

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:15.674 align:middle line:84%
because they should find some
Latin word which means...

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:16.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: By rote.

00:31:16.942 --> 00:31:18.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...to stuff
down your throat, you see.

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:19.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:20.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Not to draw out
of, but to push down, to --

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:23.082 align:middle line:84%
so that you just get taught
these blocks of algebra

00:31:23.082 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and English and --
as if, you know.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And you have
to spit them back out.

00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:26.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:31:26.885 --> 00:31:28.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:31:28.087 --> 00:31:29.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Spit them
back out and so, you know,

00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:33.759 align:middle line:84%
the skill often that they're
teaching is not to do --

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:37.162 align:middle line:84%
anything to do with creativity,
but just to basically

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:42.234 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to cram for
tests and that sort of thing.

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:46.872 align:middle line:84%
So there's no creativity
or genius being inspired

00:31:46.872 --> 00:31:49.441 align:middle line:84%
in hardly anybody
on this planet.

00:31:49.441 --> 00:31:51.276 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we are a planet

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:55.347 align:middle line:84%
of seven billion
geniuses, is the truth.

00:31:55.347 --> 00:31:55.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:57.316 align:middle line:90%
Is your mission.

00:31:57.316 --> 00:32:00.452 align:middle line:84%
So I understand that completely
because I have a young daughter

00:32:00.452 --> 00:32:03.055 align:middle line:84%
in school and I see that
system coming through her

00:32:03.055 --> 00:32:04.490 align:middle line:90%
and spitting it out on tests

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.359 align:middle line:84%
and she can't tell you what
she learned the year before

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:09.161 align:middle line:84%
because of the way
that it is taught.

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:13.932 align:middle line:84%
So the way the end result of all
of this, what is the end result

00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:16.535 align:middle line:90%
of this that you're teaching?

00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:18.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well,
the end result is --

00:32:18.904 --> 00:32:23.976 align:middle line:84%
the end result of what
I'm teaching is to --

00:32:23.976 --> 00:32:27.146 align:middle line:84%
rather than come from a
conditioned consciousness,

00:32:27.146 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:84%
because we're all conditioned,
and that's not a judgment or,

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:37.389 align:middle line:84%
you know, any kind of
derisive statement.

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:43.228 align:middle line:84%
It's just a fact, is that
we all have rational minds

00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:48.100 align:middle line:84%
which are trying to help
us figure out how to go

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:52.071 align:middle line:84%
through life and work out
how it is here and come

00:32:52.071 --> 00:32:55.307 align:middle line:84%
up with some kind of
system of how it is

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:58.277 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then just
know how to operate.

00:32:58.277 --> 00:33:00.245 align:middle line:84%
But the trouble is
-- with that is --

00:33:00.245 --> 00:33:03.248 align:middle line:84%
that system, is that
we have experiences,

00:33:03.248 --> 00:33:08.587 align:middle line:84%
formative experiences basically,
that we then latch onto and go,

00:33:08.587 --> 00:33:09.822 align:middle line:90%
well, this is how it is.

00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:15.661 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you ask for
candy, you will be punished

00:33:15.661 --> 00:33:18.363 align:middle line:90%
or just whatever it is.

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:22.568 align:middle line:84%
If you experience affection,
this will be the consequence,

00:33:22.568 --> 00:33:26.138 align:middle line:90%
which has no actual truth to it.

00:33:26.138 --> 00:33:27.773 align:middle line:90%
It just was an experience.

00:33:27.773 --> 00:33:28.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's as you saying.

00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:30.309 align:middle line:84%
The people, when you
take them on the safaris,

00:33:30.309 --> 00:33:33.145 align:middle line:84%
they have these contexts that
they live their lives by.

00:33:33.145 --> 00:33:34.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Which were...

00:33:34.146 --> 00:33:35.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: That's where
they're formed.

00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:37.649 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...formed
through experience.

00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:38.984 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:33:38.984 --> 00:33:40.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Where we have
these formative experiences

00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:43.989 align:middle line:84%
and then we take on, from
those, ideas about how it is.

00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And then, those
establish rules by which we...

00:33:47.326 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: ...live, exactly.

00:33:49.628 --> 00:33:53.398 align:middle line:84%
You see? And then, they
limit us incredibly.

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:56.135 align:middle line:84%
We have personal rules.
We have societal rules,

00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:58.504 align:middle line:84%
all of which limit
us incredibly.

00:33:58.504 --> 00:34:03.008 align:middle line:84%
And so, the end result
of all what I am about

00:34:03.008 --> 00:34:08.412 align:middle line:84%
and what I support others in
is this alchemical process

00:34:08.412 --> 00:34:12.684 align:middle line:84%
of making that fixed volatile
of breaking that down,

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:16.388 align:middle line:84%
being able to rise up above
that to a higher perspective

00:34:16.388 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
of seeing not how it's
really is or how, you know,

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:22.928 align:middle line:84%
and definitively --
the definitive truth,

00:34:22.928 --> 00:34:26.765 align:middle line:90%
but the truth in the moment.

00:34:26.765 --> 00:34:30.369 align:middle line:84%
What's the truth
now in this moment?

00:34:30.369 --> 00:34:32.070 align:middle line:90%
What's the way now?

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.474 align:middle line:84%
What's the true -- what's the
highest perspective I can have

00:34:35.474 --> 00:34:36.809 align:middle line:90%
in this situation?

00:34:36.809 --> 00:34:40.245 align:middle line:84%
What's the highest action I
can take in this situation?

00:34:40.245 --> 00:34:42.747 align:middle line:84%
And operate from this
higher perspective.

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:43.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: You have.

00:34:43.515 --> 00:34:44.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: And follow

00:34:44.483 --> 00:34:45.551 align:middle line:84%
through on this higher
perspective.

00:34:45.551 --> 00:34:46.718 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: There's a
slide here -- oh, sorry.

00:34:46.718 --> 00:34:47.952 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:48.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: No.

00:34:48.487 --> 00:34:49.821 align:middle line:90%
Well, sorry.

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:53.892 align:middle line:84%
Which makes an incredible
difference in a person's life

00:34:53.892 --> 00:35:00.065 align:middle line:84%
when you do -- have this
education, the true education,

00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:04.736 align:middle line:84%
and are able to rely -- to bring
forth what is inside of you,

00:35:04.736 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
rely on that, and follow
that, then, you know,

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.078 align:middle line:84%
the magic we were talking about
before becomes really real.

00:35:13.078 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And as I say, it makes

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.716 align:middle line:84%
such a massive difference
in your own life.

00:35:17.716 --> 00:35:21.086 align:middle line:84%
And then, also -- but also for
everything around you.

00:35:21.086 --> 00:35:23.488 align:middle line:84%
It also serves the environment
that you're a part of.

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:26.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: There's different
ways of looking at life, right?

00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:31.797 align:middle line:84%
And we have -- prior to
your conversation here,

00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:33.899 align:middle line:84%
you talk about two
major misconceptions

00:35:33.899 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that we look at life
from, right?

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.469 align:middle line:90%
What are those misconceptions?

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:43.408 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Well, is that --

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:45.577 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
fundamental misconception

00:35:45.577 --> 00:35:49.047 align:middle line:84%
that virtually everyone
on the planet is subject

00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:53.218 align:middle line:84%
to until they wake up
to it is that we have

00:35:53.218 --> 00:35:55.587 align:middle line:90%
to have everything worked out.

00:35:55.587 --> 00:35:56.922 align:middle line:90%
We have to know everything.

00:35:56.922 --> 00:35:59.291 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you get
books that are very popular,

00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:02.761 align:middle line:84%
like A Short History of the
World

00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:04.363 align:middle line:90%
or The Book About Everything.

00:36:04.363 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: How tos.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:36:05.597 --> 00:36:06.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:36:06.298 --> 00:36:07.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: You know?

00:36:07.232 --> 00:36:07.666 align:middle line:84%
And metaphysics as
well, you know.

00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:09.101 align:middle line:90%
These.

00:36:09.101 --> 00:36:10.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Five steps to
this, 10 steps to that.

00:36:10.936 --> 00:36:12.204 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:12.204 --> 00:36:14.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Ideas about
this is how the world is.

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:16.541 align:middle line:84%
And rationally, we're
looking for that.

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:19.077 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all
have egoic natures

00:36:19.077 --> 00:36:23.515 align:middle line:84%
and our egos are our
vehicles of orientation.

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:27.920 align:middle line:84%
They're there to work out
how it is and thereby know --

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.456 align:middle line:84%
by knowing how it is,
know how to operate here.

00:36:31.456 --> 00:36:36.261 align:middle line:84%
But the trouble is, that
that then hooks you,

00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:38.797 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite insidious
because that then just hooks you

00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:41.233 align:middle line:84%
into a limited idea
of how it is,

00:36:41.233 --> 00:36:42.701 align:middle line:90%
that you become dedicated to.

00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:45.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, Gandhi
said, "I'm dedicated

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.572 align:middle line:84%
to the truth, not
to consistency."

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:51.376 align:middle line:84%
But egoically, we become very
dedicated to consistency.

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:55.247 align:middle line:84%
We work out how it is and
then we create a pattern

00:36:55.247 --> 00:36:58.383 align:middle line:84%
of that experience and we
want proof of that and we want

00:36:58.383 --> 00:37:03.088 align:middle line:84%
to be dedicated to
that consistency.

00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:06.491 align:middle line:84%
And so, really, the most
functional way you can live

00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:10.329 align:middle line:84%
in life is to be
open-minded and...

00:37:10.329 --> 00:37:11.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:37:11.663 --> 00:37:13.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...really, you
know, it's like you and I,

00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:16.802 align:middle line:84%
were having this conversation
before we came on camera

00:37:16.802 --> 00:37:22.841 align:middle line:84%
where you were saying about how
you reach levels where you need

00:37:22.841 --> 00:37:27.312 align:middle line:84%
to know new levels of -- come
to new levels of awareness

00:37:27.312 --> 00:37:28.981 align:middle line:84%
or have new levels
of information.

00:37:28.981 --> 00:37:30.816 align:middle line:84%
And those then become
presented to you.

00:37:30.816 --> 00:37:32.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yes.

00:37:32.017 --> 00:37:32.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And that's
actually how we're meant

00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:33.185 align:middle line:90%
to live.

00:37:33.185 --> 00:37:33.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That's amazing.

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:34.753 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:35.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: You know,
in a way that we opened.

00:37:35.954 --> 00:37:37.956 align:middle line:84%
And through that openness,
receive these new levels

00:37:37.956 --> 00:37:40.992 align:middle line:84%
of information and
awareness that help us then...

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:42.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...function
functionally...

00:37:42.828 --> 00:37:43.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: I was...

00:37:43.595 --> 00:37:44.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: ...in life.

00:37:44.162 --> 00:37:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.531 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
how the old ways

00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:50.369 align:middle line:84%
of creating aren't necessarily
working any longer, where we set

00:37:50.369 --> 00:37:52.371 align:middle line:84%
up structures and
systems and graphs

00:37:52.371 --> 00:37:53.739 align:middle line:90%
and projections and so forth.

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:57.609 align:middle line:84%
And that does keep
us safe in the world.

00:37:57.609 --> 00:37:58.744 align:middle line:90%
It's predictable.

00:37:58.744 --> 00:38:00.512 align:middle line:84%
We set a goal and then
we have a result, right?

00:38:00.512 --> 00:38:03.415 align:middle line:84%
This is what keeps us, in
a way, safe in the world.

00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:06.752 align:middle line:84%
When you start to create in the
way that you're talking about,

00:38:06.752 --> 00:38:10.522 align:middle line:84%
where you are open to the
possibilities of things coming

00:38:10.522 --> 00:38:13.859 align:middle line:84%
to you, where things flow in
that place of ease and grace

00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:18.063 align:middle line:84%
and they just happen and they
work, threatens our safety.

00:38:18.063 --> 00:38:19.364 align:middle line:90%
Talk to me about that.

00:38:19.364 --> 00:38:22.434 align:middle line:84%
And I do create and I'm
learning to create...

00:38:22.434 --> 00:38:23.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:38:23.235 --> 00:38:24.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: ...in this new way.

00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to know,
when I get back

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:31.176 align:middle line:84%
into that survival struggle way
of creating, how do I let go

00:38:31.176 --> 00:38:34.579 align:middle line:84%
of the safety that that
appears to have given me

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and completely throw that out
and go towards that blind faith?

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:42.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well, you see, I
mean, that's call vulnerability.

00:38:42.187 --> 00:38:45.056 align:middle line:84%
And living as a genius
and living

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:47.959 align:middle line:84%
as a creator is a
vulnerable state,

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:51.797 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of creators will
then try and cope with by,

00:38:51.797 --> 00:38:55.233 align:middle line:84%
you know, drinking or taking
drugs, and then actually end

00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:57.202 align:middle line:90%
up killing their creativity.

00:38:57.202 --> 00:38:58.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:38:58.537 --> 00:39:00.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Because the
creative state is a vulnerable

00:39:00.138 --> 00:39:03.108 align:middle line:84%
state, as you've
just expressed now.

00:39:03.108 --> 00:39:05.177 align:middle line:84%
And, you see, the
thing about it is

00:39:05.177 --> 00:39:09.448 align:middle line:84%
that we do have these structures
that you're referring to.

00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:13.552 align:middle line:84%
We do have established ways
of looking at life and dealing

00:39:13.552 --> 00:39:18.657 align:middle line:84%
with life that we have
established to defend ourselves

00:39:18.657 --> 00:39:21.293 align:middle line:84%
and to be -- approach
life safely.

00:39:21.293 --> 00:39:22.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:39:22.127 --> 00:39:23.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: The trouble is

00:39:23.128 --> 00:39:24.362 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually
not really safe.

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:25.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: They're
not productive.

00:39:26.631 --> 00:39:30.602 align:middle line:84%
For most people, their
structures actually keep them

00:39:30.602 --> 00:39:35.807 align:middle line:84%
in poverty, keep them in, you
know, keep them in danger,

00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:40.145 align:middle line:84%
keep them, as I just said,
in poverty or keep them

00:39:40.145 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:84%
in abusive relationships
or whatever.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Or a constrictive
way of thinking.

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:46.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Or
constrictive way of thinking.

00:39:46.184 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. So really, to
be most viable in life is

00:39:56.761 --> 00:40:00.866 align:middle line:84%
to open ourselves up to
a higher perspective.

00:40:00.866 --> 00:40:05.137 align:middle line:84%
It just feels to us we
have always hung on...

00:40:05.137 --> 00:40:06.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:08.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...to our
limited way of seeing things

00:40:08.707 --> 00:40:11.977 align:middle line:90%
for supposed survival reasons.

00:40:11.977 --> 00:40:15.313 align:middle line:84%
It only seems as though,
then, when we abandon that,

00:40:15.313 --> 00:40:18.183 align:middle line:84%
that we're letting go
of safety -- excuse me.

00:40:18.183 --> 00:40:20.252 align:middle line:90%
The fact is that we're not.

00:40:20.252 --> 00:40:24.289 align:middle line:84%
We're actually going into a
higher level of viability.

00:40:24.289 --> 00:40:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:28.159 align:middle line:84%
Go -- I'm thinking in
terms of maybe a corporation

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.228 align:middle line:90%
or a business structure,

00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:32.864 align:middle line:84%
where you do have certain
structures and so forth.

00:40:32.864 --> 00:40:36.735 align:middle line:84%
And what you're proposing here,
and you say it in this slide,

00:40:36.735 --> 00:40:38.803 align:middle line:84%
the second premise of
what you're proposing is

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:39.871 align:middle line:90%
that we make it all up.

00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:40.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:40:40.906 --> 00:40:42.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Tell that
to a stockholder.

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:46.311 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we're just going to make
up this year. [laughter]

00:40:46.311 --> 00:40:47.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Well, you know,

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:50.181 align:middle line:84%
who built the biggest
corporation in history

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:53.385 align:middle line:84%
by stockholder value,
by turnover?

00:40:53.385 --> 00:40:53.952 align:middle line:90%
Steve Jobs, Apple.

00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:54.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:40:54.753 --> 00:40:55.687 align:middle line:90%
I was just thinking of that.

00:40:55.687 --> 00:40:57.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And
what did he do?

00:40:57.022 --> 00:40:58.657 align:middle line:90%
He just made it up.

00:40:58.657 --> 00:40:59.224 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Made it up.

00:40:59.224 --> 00:41:00.225 align:middle line:90%
Based on heart.

00:41:00.225 --> 00:41:01.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: He
just made it up.

00:41:01.593 --> 00:41:05.397 align:middle line:84%
Whatever he based it on, he's
very vilified and, you know,

00:41:05.397 --> 00:41:08.099 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to defend
his personal life

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:09.901 align:middle line:84%
or his personal character
and that.

00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:12.637 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at his
success and his achievement...

00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:14.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:41:14.039 --> 00:41:18.343 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: ...he -- and we
could name hundreds of people,

00:41:18.343 --> 00:41:21.813 align:middle line:84%
but, I mean, he's, I
think, the most well known.

00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And the arch exponent of
this, he made up, you know,

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.652 align:middle line:84%
when he said we're
going to have shops,

00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:29.554 align:middle line:84%
people said you can't
have Apple shops.

00:41:29.554 --> 00:41:31.623 align:middle line:90%
You only got 10 things to sell.

00:41:31.623 --> 00:41:33.024 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:41:33.024 --> 00:41:34.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: What -- he thought of
the personal computer at home.

00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:36.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:41:36.061 --> 00:41:37.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: It was a
completely foreign idea.

00:41:37.295 --> 00:41:39.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: The chairman
of IBM famously said,

00:41:39.664 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
"The market for personal
computers is five."

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Right.

00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:44.002 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: You see?

00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:48.573 align:middle line:84%
So he just made these things up
about, well, what can I make up?

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:49.975 align:middle line:90%
What would I love to make

00:41:49.975 --> 00:41:52.244 align:middle line:84%
up that can make
people's lives different,

00:41:52.244 --> 00:41:53.745 align:middle line:90%
that can serve people's lives?

00:41:53.745 --> 00:41:56.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I saw recently
a biography on him

00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:00.085 align:middle line:84%
and he was a stratospheric
visionary.

00:42:00.085 --> 00:42:01.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: He was.

00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:02.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Now, there was
a cost for that for him,

00:42:02.587 --> 00:42:06.157 align:middle line:84%
but he had levels of
thinking that were not even

00:42:06.157 --> 00:42:08.627 align:middle line:84%
in the current domain
of reality,

00:42:08.627 --> 00:42:11.896 align:middle line:84%
and that's where most
corporations these days

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:13.198 align:middle line:90%
are thinking.

00:42:13.198 --> 00:42:15.734 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about -- look
at Amazon, who's just come

00:42:15.734 --> 00:42:17.202 align:middle line:90%
out with the Droids and stuff.

00:42:17.202 --> 00:42:20.405 align:middle line:84%
But there is a cost to progress,
as there always has been,

00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:23.108 align:middle line:84%
but if you look at
that level of thinking,

00:42:23.108 --> 00:42:24.876 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're
talking about applying

00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:27.512 align:middle line:90%
to your regular everyday life.

00:42:27.512 --> 00:42:28.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yes.

00:42:28.847 --> 00:42:30.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And it takes blowing
apart the current reality

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:90%
that you're living in.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Exactly.

00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:36.021 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
there has to be a cost.

00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:39.257 align:middle line:84%
You see, I think that's just
something else we have made up

00:42:39.257 --> 00:42:41.226 align:middle line:90%
and just another belief.

00:42:41.226 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if you approach
it in a structured way,

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:51.536 align:middle line:84%
as alchemy teaches us to
do, there isn't a cost.

00:42:51.536 --> 00:42:53.905 align:middle line:84%
There's just -- it's
just win-win.

00:42:53.905 --> 00:42:57.042 align:middle line:84%
You begin creating in
a situation where --

00:42:57.042 --> 00:43:00.245 align:middle line:84%
you see, Steve Jobs did a lot
of what he did, if I can speak

00:43:00.245 --> 00:43:01.713 align:middle line:84%
to him, because I
-- speak for him,

00:43:01.713 --> 00:43:04.582 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know him personally.

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:08.353 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I think it's
quite obvious when you just look

00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:13.158 align:middle line:84%
at it that by the conflict
that he had in his life

00:43:13.158 --> 00:43:15.827 align:middle line:84%
and the problems that
also followed him,

00:43:15.827 --> 00:43:19.397 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't an
educated creator.

00:43:19.397 --> 00:43:21.466 align:middle line:90%
He was an instinctive creator.

00:43:21.466 --> 00:43:24.803 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually
learn to create in a way

00:43:24.803 --> 00:43:27.405 align:middle line:90%
that eliminates conflict

00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:33.344 align:middle line:84%
and that actually eliminates
risk and eliminates...

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:34.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Wow.

00:43:34.145 --> 00:43:34.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: ...the cost.

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:37.315 align:middle line:90%
Where you can create in a way

00:43:37.315 --> 00:43:40.719 align:middle line:84%
where there's just
upside and just win-win.

00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see, your
genius is pulling everything

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.524 align:middle line:90%
together perfectly.

00:43:46.524 --> 00:43:51.296 align:middle line:84%
It knows your higher
nature, your higher mind,

00:43:51.296 --> 00:43:54.899 align:middle line:84%
has an eagle eye vision of
everything and it knows how to

00:43:54.899 --> 00:44:01.239 align:middle line:84%
pull everything together in a
very holistic, synergistic way.

00:44:01.239 --> 00:44:07.812 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in touch with
that and follow its path,

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:13.852 align:middle line:84%
then you can do this in a
very sort of uplifted way,

00:44:13.852 --> 00:44:17.555 align:middle line:84%
I would say, without the kind of
costs that you're referring to.

00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:18.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: It's interesting.

00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:20.525 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned
in this next slide

00:44:20.525 --> 00:44:23.027 align:middle line:84%
that our definition
creates our reality.

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:27.198 align:middle line:84%
And this comes to mind, anybody
who was raised in an environment

00:44:27.198 --> 00:44:29.768 align:middle line:84%
where there was a
lot of survival

00:44:29.768 --> 00:44:34.139 align:middle line:84%
and there was survival coping
skills that were created

00:44:34.139 --> 00:44:35.774 align:middle line:90%
to -- in order to survive.

00:44:35.774 --> 00:44:40.044 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who had an abusive
relationship or a painful past,

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:43.081 align:middle line:84%
out of an effort to actually
survive, you make up a lot

00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:45.650 align:middle line:84%
of your own reality
in order to survive.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:46.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Sure.

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Those people tend
to be our visionaries,

00:44:49.287 --> 00:44:50.889 align:middle line:84%
tend to have the
most tragic past

00:44:50.889 --> 00:44:52.557 align:middle line:84%
because they were
really making it

00:44:52.557 --> 00:44:54.859 align:middle line:84%
up as they went along
in order to live.

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And look at the people that
have created things, you know,

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.566 align:middle line:84%
like the personal
computer or, you know,

00:45:01.566 --> 00:45:03.935 align:middle line:90%
entertainment in airplanes.

00:45:03.935 --> 00:45:05.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:08.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: I'm talking
about Richard Branson.

00:45:08.173 --> 00:45:09.674 align:middle line:90%
So it's an interesting --

00:45:09.674 --> 00:45:13.144 align:middle line:84%
how you create a result
out of something like that,

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and it comes with
looking at life

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.482 align:middle line:90%
through an ever-changing lens.

00:45:17.482 --> 00:45:20.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: The profound
truth that our perception

00:45:20.985 --> 00:45:25.123 align:middle line:84%
of life is created by any --
the definitions that we hold.

00:45:25.123 --> 00:45:28.393 align:middle line:84%
So whatever definitions that
we hold in our consciousness,

00:45:28.393 --> 00:45:30.695 align:middle line:84%
whether consciously
or unconsciously,

00:45:30.695 --> 00:45:33.298 align:middle line:84%
then attracts the
reality that we perceive.

00:45:33.298 --> 00:45:37.135 align:middle line:84%
So if we are holding
definitions, for instance,

00:45:37.135 --> 00:45:40.839 align:middle line:84%
that we are unsafe, we will
start to see how unsafe we are.

00:45:40.839 --> 00:45:43.708 align:middle line:84%
Or if we, you know,
are holding definitions

00:45:43.708 --> 00:45:47.879 align:middle line:84%
that we are not worthy,
then we'll start to see

00:45:47.879 --> 00:45:51.082 align:middle line:84%
that playing out, they are
reflected to us in the world.

00:45:51.082 --> 00:45:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Whatever definitions, whatever
the definitions that we hold,

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.990 align:middle line:84%
then, you know, create
the reality we perceive.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:01.459 align:middle line:84%
And I do this exercise
in the work I do

00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:04.829 align:middle line:84%
where I sit people opposite
each other and get them

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:07.131 align:middle line:84%
to imagine different
definitions,

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.833 align:middle line:84%
just define each
other differently.

00:46:08.833 --> 00:46:12.837 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very simple exercise,
but they're absolutely shocked

00:46:12.837 --> 00:46:15.740 align:middle line:84%
by what they experience because
every time the definition

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.042 align:middle line:84%
changes, their whole
feeling changes,

00:46:18.042 --> 00:46:20.378 align:middle line:84%
the look on the person's
face changes.

00:46:20.378 --> 00:46:21.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Ah.

00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:22.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: There's
a whole shapeshifting effect.

00:46:22.547 --> 00:46:23.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: Because we
identify ourselves.

00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:24.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And
people go, oh my God.

00:46:24.983 --> 00:46:28.753 align:middle line:84%
The reality I'm experiencing
out there isn't actual reality.

00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:34.092 align:middle line:84%
It's geared by however
I'm defining myself,

00:46:34.092 --> 00:46:37.061 align:middle line:84%
others or the world is
creating my perception.

00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:38.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: My perception.

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:39.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Very
powerful realization.

00:46:39.664 --> 00:46:40.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: And that's huge.

00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:41.432 align:middle line:90%
And that's.

00:46:41.432 --> 00:46:42.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: It's massive.

00:46:42.834 --> 00:46:45.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: As you said earlier,
your focus creates your reality.

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:46.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yeah.

00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So whatever you're
focused on, be it fear

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:51.843 align:middle line:84%
or safety, it will create
the constrict of the reality

00:46:51.843 --> 00:46:53.878 align:middle line:90%
at that particular time.

00:46:53.878 --> 00:46:55.780 align:middle line:84%
That what we've been talking
about this entire show,

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.182 align:middle line:84%
which I absolutely
love, is the --

00:46:58.182 --> 00:47:01.920 align:middle line:84%
is breaking outside of
that reality and creating

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.821 align:middle line:90%
at a totally different level,

00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:06.124 align:middle line:84%
which is what you define
as natural success.

00:47:06.124 --> 00:47:06.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yes.

00:47:06.624 --> 00:47:07.926 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:07.926 --> 00:47:10.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: And it's creating
from that space of miracle.

00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:15.633 align:middle line:84%
But you seem to have another
piece to it, other than miracle,

00:47:15.633 --> 00:47:18.569 align:middle line:84%
which I -- in my baby
steps here, I'm learning

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:20.405 align:middle line:90%
that I look at it as a miracle.

00:47:20.405 --> 00:47:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that it's
something other than a miracle.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.841 align:middle line:90%
You're saying it's intentional.

00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:25.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: Well,
it's intentional,

00:47:25.076 --> 00:47:27.912 align:middle line:84%
but it is a miracle,
nevertheless.

00:47:27.912 --> 00:47:30.949 align:middle line:84%
So, you see, the -- what we were
talking about earlier, before,

00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:34.619 align:middle line:84%
was about making
the fixed volatile,

00:47:34.619 --> 00:47:38.423 align:middle line:84%
breaking down your egoic
construct and perception,

00:47:38.423 --> 00:47:42.293 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to self
consciously stop identifying

00:47:42.293 --> 00:47:46.197 align:middle line:84%
with the definitions that you
have in place about yourself,

00:47:46.197 --> 00:47:48.433 align:middle line:84%
others in the world,
life, how you think it is,

00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:50.101 align:middle line:90%
where you can let go of that.

00:47:50.101 --> 00:47:54.706 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, when that
breaks down, then you do enter

00:47:54.706 --> 00:47:58.042 align:middle line:84%
into what we call innocence
in a sense, out of --

00:47:58.042 --> 00:47:59.911 align:middle line:84%
outside of thoughts
and feelings,

00:47:59.911 --> 00:48:06.217 align:middle line:84%
into an open vulnerable
state in which, then,

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:11.422 align:middle line:84%
whatever perspective is highest
for you to have to be effective

00:48:11.422 --> 00:48:15.994 align:middle line:84%
in any time and place and
moment becomes available to you,

00:48:15.994 --> 00:48:19.731 align:middle line:84%
for you to -- as a perception
and then also as actions

00:48:19.731 --> 00:48:23.134 align:middle line:84%
to follow through on and
basically a direction of that,

00:48:23.134 --> 00:48:24.936 align:middle line:84%
and just a higher direction in
life.

00:48:24.936 --> 00:48:28.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So the entire point
here is our focus creates our

00:48:28.106 --> 00:48:31.075 align:middle line:84%
reality, and that is
exactly what you were talking

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.643 align:middle line:90%
about in this entire show.

00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:33.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Yes.

00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:35.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa: So that
makes perfect sense.

00:48:35.346 --> 00:48:37.949 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for being here and all

00:48:37.949 --> 00:48:39.350 align:middle line:90%
that you shared with us.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:43.888 align:middle line:84%
And I really hope that you got
this incredibly different way

00:48:43.888 --> 00:48:46.858 align:middle line:84%
of looking at how to
create and I certainly have.

00:48:46.858 --> 00:48:48.993 align:middle line:84%
So thank you very much
for joining me today.

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:49.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Whitecloud: Thanks, Lisa.

00:48:49.794 --> 00:48:51.129 align:middle line:90%
It was a great conversation.

00:48:51.129 --> 00:48:52.296 align:middle line:90%
Thoroughly enjoyed myself.

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:52.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Me, too.

00:48:52.797 --> 00:48:53.998 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:48:53.998 --> 00:48:54.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And I hope
you and John will come

00:48:54.899 --> 00:48:56.834 align:middle line:90%
to Africa with me one day.

00:48:56.834 --> 00:48:58.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: That sounds amazing.

00:48:58.036 --> 00:48:59.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Whitecloud: And
experience what I was sharing

00:48:59.737 --> 00:49:00.304 align:middle line:90%
with you before.

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:00.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Lisa: Yeah.

00:49:00.938 --> 00:49:01.506 align:middle line:90%
It sounds amazing.

00:49:01.506 --> 00:49:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.575 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you would like to
