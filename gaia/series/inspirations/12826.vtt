00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: Hi,
this is Lisa Garr,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:90%
host of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:84%
We are coming to you live
from Boulder, Colorado

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
at the Gaiam studios
here in Boulder.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So today, we're talking about
stress and how to reduce it.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to be doing some
exercises later on in the show

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:10%
specifically about how
to obtain coherence

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.843 align:middle line:10%
and also how to reduce
stress in your life.

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be talking about
the scientific connections

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:10%
between the heart and the brain.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Joining me is Howard Martin.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:84%
He's the executive vice
president of HeartMath.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
He's also the author of
"The HeartMath Solution."

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And he's on the steering
committee for the Global

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.385 align:middle line:90%
Coherence Initiative.

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me today.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOWARD MARTIN:
Well, Lisa, it's

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
a pleasure to be here with
you in the Gaiam studios

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
out here in the beautiful snow
covered Rocky Mountains today.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I know.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful out today.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's been a great day.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.921 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is what
stress is about.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It's about anxiety.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:10%
It's about things crashing that
you are out of control with.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of things
that go along with stress.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.575 align:middle line:10%
So exactly what does
stress do to the body?

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
it's debilitating

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:90%
really, too much stress.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.833 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can have a
certain natural amount

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:90%
of stress in life.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
But if it's ongoing,
if it's chronic,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:10%
it's very debilitating
to health.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:10%
Stress releases
hormones into our body

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:10%
that, in excessive amounts,
just aren't good for us.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.407 align:middle line:10%
Things like cortisol
and adrenaline,

00:01:32.407 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:10%
too much of that's just
not a healthy thing.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And then you
burn out the adrenals,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:10%
and you go into the fight or--
it's like we're constantly

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:10%
in fear of the tiger.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.842 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's correct.

00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And the nervous system,
autonomic nervous system

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:90%
goes into a state of fatigue.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
That leads to a host of
other medical problems.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And then at a
psychological level,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.128 align:middle line:84%
really, I think it's robbing
us of the quality of life.

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We live in a society today when
there's just a lot of stress.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's unavoidable
in some ways.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.325 align:middle line:84%
But there are things we can
do to reduce it in other ways.

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: What are some of
the main sources of stress

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.325 align:middle line:10%
that I'm seeing here?

00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:04.463 align:middle line:10%
What are the ways that
people experience stress?

00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Well, there's
two major things

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:10%
that show up in most
stress surveys as number

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.790 align:middle line:10%
one and number two.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.262 align:middle line:10%
The first one is the feeling
of not having enough time.

00:02:12.262 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think if
you're anybody who's

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:90%
listening can relate to that.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Does it feel like you just
can't get it all done?

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough time.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.638 align:middle line:90%
There's too much to do.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
This person's comment was my
workload has doubled, you know,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.622 align:middle line:90%
These are things that are real.

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So that feeling of not
having enough time.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.525 align:middle line:84%
The second is the feeling
of not being in control.

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The feeling of not
having choices and not--

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Your world is spinning
out of control.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I can't control it.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
These things are
happening to me.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's happening outside.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I can do
nothing about it.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have a job that
I hate but I can't quit.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
These are examples of
just not having control.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's also the global
economic situation and what

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with in our
political environments

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.593 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The thing about stress
is people sometimes don't see

00:02:50.593 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not just
the external things.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It's our perception of external
things that create the stress.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, this
is where it gets interesting,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:84%
it's the emotional
reactions we are

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.442 align:middle line:84%
having to the perceptions
that we're having of stress.

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So I just said that the two
major things that show up

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:84%
on surveys as a
source of stress are

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of not
having enough time

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and the feeling of
not being in control.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Well, then
Anthony here on Twitter

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:10%
basically says that it is
real, that people are laid off

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:10%
and that he is doing
the work of 10 people.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.553 align:middle line:90%
That's real.

00:03:22.553 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's real.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:90%
So he can't change that.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.318 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that he can change
is his emotional reactions

00:03:27.318 --> 00:03:28.118 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:03:28.118 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is
he feeling inside?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Not saying that's easy.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.008 align:middle line:84%
I have tremendous compassion
for Anthony and all the people

00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
out there who are
going through a lot

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:90%
of extra stress in their life.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:90%
It's endemic of our time.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.807 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
that's the solution really.

00:03:40.807 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
change all the externals.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
We're in this high speed
era right now where

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:90%
things are very volatile.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to be able
to change all these things.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.415 align:middle line:84%
Our best option is to learn
to change from the inside out.

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What is
the significance?

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And how does heart
play into all of this?

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
What's that connection between
the heart and the brain?

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.588 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, our work
at HeartMath for years

00:03:57.588 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is really implementing
a heart-based system

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
consisting of methods,
tools, and technology

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
all designed to empower people
during these changing times.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh good.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: It's what we do there.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.035 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what we
need, empowerment, yes.

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's exactly what
we've been doing for 20 years

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.903 align:middle line:84%
And heart's been
around for a long time

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:90%
if you think about it.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.195 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years,
people talked

00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:84%
about heart and referenced
heart in these glowing ways.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in modern
society, we often

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:84%
find ourselves
disconnected from that,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
sort of living life
from the neck up

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:90%
of what heart really is.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So to me, what heart
is it's physiological.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
We certainly know about its
cardiovascular function.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.443 align:middle line:84%
And I'll share some
things in a minute

00:04:31.443 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:84%
about what it does at
a physiological level

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:90%
that people don't realize.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It's also an emotional heart.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
The words like love,
care, compassion--

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gratitude.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --gratitude,
appreciation--

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's my favorite.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --those things always
come fit together with heart.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's an emotional side
of what heart really is.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a spiritual
connection that we have that

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
comes through heart where we
really connect to something

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:90%
larger than our ordinary self.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in through
really to me from heart.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And taken back around,
it's that part of us where

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:90%
our authentic self comes from.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is the thing
that reduces the stress here

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.583 align:middle line:84%
is getting in contact
with that space.

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:06.542 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:90%
It's an intelligence we have.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
We call it heart
intelligence at HeartMath.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It's this magnificent
intelligence

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:90%
that we were all born with.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:90%
It's there all the time.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:90%
We get disconnected from it.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
We start living our
life from the neck up.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
We cut ourselves
off from something

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
that's part of who we are
and essential to living

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.117 align:middle line:84%
a meaningful and
fulfilling life.

00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
The methods, techniques, and
things we have at HeartMath

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.710 align:middle line:84%
are just designed to
reconnect you with that.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.665 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, life
can get better quicker.

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you ever notice where
you're traveling around or even

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
looking if you go
to a restaurant,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.763 align:middle line:90%
everyone's on their phones.

00:05:36.763 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're just looking
at this device, which

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
has so many fun
bells and whistles,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:84%
instead of connecting
to each other.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
If people are standing in
an unfamiliar environment,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:90%
it's like an instant reaction.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Rather than connecting and
communicating with humans,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
which might be dangerous
and I don't know ,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.345 align:middle line:84%
it's the instant
defense mechanism.

00:05:57.345 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's
just one example

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:84%
of the way we are
living our lives now.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's not
necessarily all bad.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just saying
it's part of the habits

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:90%
that we've developed.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But many people now are
getting on to the fact

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that they can't go on living
the ways in which they've

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:90%
been living.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.648 align:middle line:90%
And that's actually positive.

00:06:10.648 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:90%
That's motivation.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
That's part of this era
that's been generically called

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:90%
by many the shift.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
As people are
starting to change,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
starting to want
things to be different,

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:84%
starting to develop new
capacities within themselves to

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:84%
manifest the changes
that they want.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's a time, as I
said, of great opportunity

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as all these
challenges that we face.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.418 align:middle line:84%
I'm both a pragmatist
and an optimist.

00:06:30.418 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the heart
has a frequency.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And the frequency
communicates from the heart

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
to the brain, the
heart to the brain.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is the place where
the coherence is potentially

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:90%
achieved, right?

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.335 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So at
Institute of HeartMath,

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:45.243 align:middle line:84%
and the brilliant
researchers we have there

00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:84%
for years have
been doing research

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
understanding the heart's
role beyond its cardiovascular

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And their research
combined with research

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that they found scattered
in research literature

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
around the world that's painted
a really interesting picture

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
of what heart at a
physical level is.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It's an information
processing center in our body.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.710 align:middle line:90%
It communicates with us.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Not the brain?

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well,
the brain certainly

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.342 align:middle line:84%
is the information
processing center.

00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:90%
But so is the heart.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
The heart sends
information to the brain

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the body.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Brain function is actually
critically dependent,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, upon
this information.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it sends to the brain
instead of the brain sending

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:90%
to the heart?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The brain's sending
information down to the heart,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
controlling timing
of the heartbeat.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.755 align:middle line:84%
But the heart is sending
a lot of information

00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:90%
back to the brain.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.525 align:middle line:84%
One way it does it is through
a neurological communication.

00:07:27.525 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
a nervous system

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
in the heart, studied
through the field of what's

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:90%
called neuro cardiology.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.028 align:middle line:84%
It's a very sophisticated
nervous system.

00:07:35.028 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It communicates with
the brain and the head

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.385 align:middle line:84%
through a nerve
pathway starting here

00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that then travels
into the brain,

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
terminates up our higher
perceptual thinking centers,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:90%
neocortex.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's a constant
neurological conversation

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
happening between
heart and brain.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Feedback.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: When researchers map
out the neurological activity

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.495 align:middle line:84%
in the body, they can see that
there's more information being

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
sent to the brain from
the heart than it ever

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:90%
receives from the brain.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
interesting phenomenon,

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:90%
something I didn't know.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: More information
from the heart?

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.892 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It communicates things
like the blood pressure way.

00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:84%
The heart is actually
producing hormones.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:84%
These are all new discoveries
showing that the heart is

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.803 align:middle line:90%
doing more than pumping blood.

00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Are we
addicted to stress?

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We're addicted to
stimulation for one thing.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And many people perceive
stress as something

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that you have to have,
that you won't be good

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
it, that you won't

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:90%
perform unless you're stressed.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a driver.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.992 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: There's a term that
our founder at HeartMath,

00:08:23.992 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Institute of HeartMath,
Doc Childre, has.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
He says, there's a
difference between stress

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:90%
and creative resistance energy.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Creative resistance energy would
be stepping up to another level

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:84%
to meet a task that makes
you better, expands you

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
beyond your mediocrity, so that
you have some stress associated

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:84%
You have something you have to
do that's unfamiliar to you,

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:84%
but you have to sort of go
that next level within yourself

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:90%
and make it happen.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:84%
That's different than
just this ongoing grind

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
of stress of emotional
reactions to this and that,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:84%
anxiety about things, and anger
about things, and frustration.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, it creates
that, as you said,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.540 align:middle line:84%
cortisol reaction, which
then could stimulate you

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:90%
into action.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I could see how it
could be an addiction.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.983 align:middle line:84%
You have a reaction
to something.

00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:90%
It creates adrenaline.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you fight
towards that reaction.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:90%
And then you fight to it.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
things done that way.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes an
addictive pattern.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Sure.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:90%
But here's the way I look at it.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.835 align:middle line:84%
So you can change
your emotional--

00:09:15.835 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:90%
I call it your emotional diet.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
People get addicted to
the stress emotions.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They get addicted to feeling
anxious or mad, things

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.245 align:middle line:84%
And it's producing hormones
that they get accustomed to.

00:09:26.245 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:84%
When you become more
heart-centric in the way

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
you live, and you
begin to really feel

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
emotions like appreciation and
gratitude and care and love

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and those kind of
things, what happens

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
is you begin to desire those
so much more that you have

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:84%
the motivation to replace those
other emotions that are more

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
draining, certainly harder
on your body and on your life

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And you learn to develop a
new sort of emotional diet

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:90%
like what I call you know?

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what we're
talking about today.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Exactly.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So what are
some of the ways

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and explain the science
behind the heart's field,

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that resonance that comes out
of the heart and heals us.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, the
ways I mentioned before

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
about heart communicating,
its intelligence

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
were biological pathways,
hardwired biology.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But the heart also does
things a bit differently.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is an
electrical organ.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.502 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy producing organ.

00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It produces by far the
source of bioelectricity

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.192 align:middle line:84%
we have in our
body, 40 to 60 times

00:10:21.192 --> 00:10:22.775 align:middle line:84%
stronger than what
the brain produces.

00:10:22.775 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It goes to
every single cell.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Now the signal is strong
enough that it radiates

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:84%
beyond our skin out
into space creating

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic field that
surrounds us in 360 degrees.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not talking about an
aura or about subtle energy.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Those things may exist.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm talking
about right now

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
is very measurable
electromagnetic energy.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: An actual frequency

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Like radio

we reported on another
clinic's findings

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
that said they'd measured
it eight to 10 feet away.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Eight to 10 feet?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.805 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Researchers at
the Institute of HeartMath

00:10:59.805 --> 00:11:01.397 align:middle line:84%
will stand behind
three to four feet.

00:11:01.397 --> 00:11:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, we're
producing this field.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.250 align:middle line:90%
So right now, our fields--

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.542 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Are intermingling, yes.

00:11:05.542 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You and I are
commingling right now.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you come into
a room with your loved ones,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.480 align:middle line:84%
your energy field will start to
intermingle before you actually

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.087 align:middle line:90%
Or if you're in--

00:11:18.087 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:90%
that makes a lot of sense.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a work
environment and you

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
come into the field
of someone who's

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe having anxiety
or stress, you

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
can feel that as you
walk into the room.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You very possibly can.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:84%
This may be one
way to explain it.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
is that the energy

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
in the field, the
frequencies or the radio

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
stations in the field, do
change depending upon what

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:90%
we're feeling emotionally.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:84%
If we're experiencing a strong
negative emotion, for example,

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.517 align:middle line:84%
like frustration
or anger, it will

00:11:42.517 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
produce what's called
an incoherent spectra,

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.892 align:middle line:84%
a lot of frequencies,
but they're not

00:11:45.892 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:90%
working harmoniously.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:84%
If we are experiencing, for
example, a feeling of gratitude

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and it was sincere or
a feeling of care that

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
was really genuine,
then the field changes.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:84%
We produce more of what's
called a harmonic spectra.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.483 align:middle line:90%
So there's harmony in the field.

00:12:01.483 --> 00:12:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're sending
this out all the time.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.525 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense,
through out heart,

00:12:04.525 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:90%
we're broadcasting our emotions.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where the inquiry
gets interesting to me.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Because now we go beyond
biology and we're into physics.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:84%
How does my field relate
to the field in my brain?

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:84%
How does my field
and your field,

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
how are we relating now
at an energetic level?

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, how does the
collective field of humanity

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:90%
relate?

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And then how does the
collective field of humanity

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
relate to the fields that
the Earth naturally produces?

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Like the gentleman who sent us
a message earlier about he's

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:84%
working twice as
many hours, his job's

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.665 align:middle line:84%
in jeopardy, whatever
those things are,

00:12:37.665 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:90%
those are big things.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.207 align:middle line:84%
And I have understanding
and compassion.

00:12:40.207 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:90%
They are stressful.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying, you just
do a heart technique and, poof,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:90%
they go away.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But you can learn to
make peace with things better.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And as you do it on the little
things, moment to moment, day

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to day, the little common
irritations and frustrations,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
as you turn those
around, as you make

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.227 align:middle line:84%
an internal emotional
shift in yourself

00:12:56.227 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and don't go through the
same predictable patterns

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
all the time, you begin
to accumulate energy.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
That builds up into
what we call resilience.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And that begins to create a
buffer that makes things easier

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And even the big things
get easier to deal with.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you develop
a resource of resilience

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:90%
in your body?

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, you have
to look at it this way.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:90%
We are energy systems.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
We accumulate and deplete
energy, kind of like batteries.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have physical,
mental, emotional energy.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: When we experience
a lot of negative emotions,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.708 align:middle line:84%
we allow those
things to run, we're

00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:84%
bleeding off a lot of our
emotional energy reserves,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.475 align:middle line:90%
It' just draining us.

00:13:30.475 --> 00:13:31.558 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Draining us, yeah.

00:13:31.558 --> 00:13:33.142 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: If we stop
that, if we learn

00:13:33.142 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
how to stop that
or at least arrest

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:84%
it earlier and then shift it
to where we're experiencing

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.800 align:middle line:84%
something that is more
positive and regenerative,

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:84%
then we're adding
energy back into that.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:90%
We're recharging the battery.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:90%
So it becomes simple math.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
If you add more energy
than you deplete,

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.223 align:middle line:90%
your resilience increases.

00:13:50.223 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
If you continue to
bleed off more energy

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
than you're putting
in, resilience

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:90%
is going to decrease.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Resilience is interesting.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
ability to bounce back.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.777 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things that resilience

00:14:00.777 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:84%
is is the ability to
come back quicker.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
your resilience level

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:84%
up another level, it
does create a buffer

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
that does sort of,
in a sense, offer

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:84%
some protection from the
stressors that would normally

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.435 align:middle line:90%
get us.

00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes from
what we're doing.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.828 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's the little
things that count today.

00:14:20.828 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
big things come up,

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.578 align:middle line:90%
we can deal with them better.

00:14:23.578 --> 00:14:25.477 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you build
resilience by practice?

00:14:25.477 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You do it by practice.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And you do it by
practicing, again,

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
on the things that
you can see and doing

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.530 align:middle line:84%
what you can see
that's real to you

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.510 align:middle line:90%
and learning to make shifts.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Heroes to me are people that
I watch bend an attitude.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:90%
You know like--

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What's that?

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You can see,
well, you can see them,

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:90%
they're going to go one way.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get
mad about something.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:90%
And you see them stop.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:90%
You see them gather them self.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And you see them
go to a place where

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
they begin to become
more neutral about it

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe even turn
it all the way around.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
When I see that happen,
when I see a person do that,

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:90%
that's inspirational to me.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Because what I see that
as is the real work that

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
leads to the rest of the
things that people really

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.923 align:middle line:90%
want in their lives.

00:15:01.923 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm proud of
people that do that.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And I feel good about
myself when I do that.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I really want to
get into the whole part

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:90%
about coherence.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.892 align:middle line:84%
But I want to recognize
George on Facebook that's

00:15:09.892 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:84%
talking about how to deal
with the death of a loved one

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and how that causes
massive stress, especially

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:90%
around the holiday time.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.190 align:middle line:84%
At any time, it's
difficult. So with still

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle line:84%
honoring the death
of a loved one,

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
how do you deal with
that type of a stress?

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Gosh, that's
a really tough one.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And I understand, George, what
you're asking about there.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have to-- that's
a very personal decision.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to allow yourself to
feel the things that you need

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
to feel about that and
to allow that to unfold

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.893 align:middle line:90%
in a natural process.

00:15:39.893 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
I think people

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:84%
recognize when
it's time for them

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:90%
to sort of move on from that.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.945 align:middle line:84%
But it's so personal
that I don't really

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:90%
address it that much.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Because each person's
situation in that context

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:90%
is so very, very different.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm sure you've
been asked that before.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And the
compassion thing,

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.500 align:middle line:84%
you know compassion
for yourself,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:90%
whatever you're feeling.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.860 align:middle line:84%
If George is personally
affected by this,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
let me say to you,
George, self-compassion

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most important
things you can do right now.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:10.358 align:middle line:84%
Understand that your feelings
are real, and that they're OK.

00:16:10.358 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Anytime someone goes
through something like this,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.025 align:middle line:84%
they're going to feel
things like that.

00:16:14.025 --> 00:16:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So don't feel any badness
about it or any guilt.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Instead, feel of
self-compassion,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:90%
that feeling of you're OK.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:90%
You're taking care of yourself.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And feel what you need to feel.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
At the right time, your
own heart's intuition

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
will begin to prompt
you on when it's

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:84%
time to move on, when
it's time to shift and go

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:90%
another direction.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is so personal to
each individual and their type

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:84%
of relationship that they and
the whole situation, that it's

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:84%
difficult to have a panacea or a
prescriptive formula for things

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
important, absolutely.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's a very
sensitive situation.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So Cathy on
Twitter is asking

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:84%
about some practices that would
allow someone to reconnect

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:90%
with their heart intelligence.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Back to the heart
intelligence field, so let's--

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We're going to share
some of those in a few minutes.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, good.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And we're also
going to demonstrate

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
some technology called the
emWave technology we developed

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
at HeartMath that
helps to measure

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the quality of
communication taking

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:84%
place between our
heart and our brain.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
show you some of that.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.297 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I can say
for everyone listening,

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
let's all try to listen
from this place right now.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's do it together right now
and just shift your attention

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
right here to the area in the
center of your chest, just

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:90%
called heart focus.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the
energy sort of moving

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:84%
from here down to here in
the center of your chest.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.260 align:middle line:84%
The second thing you can
do is to go to what's

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:90%
called heart-focused breathing.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Breathe naturally and
normally but a little deeper

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:90%
than you normally would.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that,
try to imagine

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that that breath is
coming right in and out

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.575 align:middle line:84%
to where you have your focus
in the center of your chest.

00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:46.693 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:17:46.693 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And do that
for a few breaths.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, and this is
the most important step,

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:84%
try to feel a
positive emotion that

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:84%
could be something like the love
or care you have for someone

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:90%
or some thing in your life.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.405 align:middle line:84%
It can be just a
feeling of appreciation

00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
for the good things
in your life.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I can appreciate
right now being here with you

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and being here at Gaiam and
having an opportunity to share

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.877 align:middle line:84%
what we do at HeartMath
and Institute of HeartMath

00:18:12.877 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:90%
with so many people.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I appreciate
what you do there.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.207 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And it could
also be a feeling

00:18:17.207 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
of just good old
well-being, like life's OK.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All is well.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And that'll make
even the show and listening

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to the show a
different experience.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as we're doing this,
our resonance in our heart

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
is changing right
now and the frequency

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and the literal frequency
of our heart's emotions

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:84%
are emitting a energy
wave pattern that goes out

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:84%
from us that goes to the
people that are watching,

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:90%
that goes to other countries.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It goes out and
beyond the planet?

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Absolutely.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
When we do a technique like
that and we do it sincerely,

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:84%
we enter a state
called coherence.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.685 align:middle line:84%
The medical term is
psychophysiological coherence.

00:18:53.685 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that's
when all this heart

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:84%
brain communication
information exchange

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
is working together
harmoniously.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Coherence is a wonderful state.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It is a state where the body
systems are all synchronized

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:90%
and working in harmony.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
They're synchronizing really
to the rhythms of the heart.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.680 align:middle line:90%
And less energy is being wasted.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a very highly
efficient state.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
It's also a state accompanied
by sustained positive emotions.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:84%
You trigger it by
doing what we just did.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Try to feel appreciation
or love or care

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:90%
for something in your life.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
That begins to trigger
the coherent state.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And then once you're
in that state,

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:84%
those type of
feelings and emotions

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:90%
come more easily to you.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is a state that's
highly observant and aware.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:90%
It is calm and balanced.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.450 align:middle line:84%
It's arrived at through
things like our prayers,

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
our meditations, our
walks in the woods,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
times with our children, our
grandchildren, or whatever.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a
highly aware state.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
what athletes get

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
into when they're in the zone.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.392 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's also a flow state
when you have more of a flow

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:56.467 align:middle line:84%
as you move through the
daily events of life.

00:19:56.467 --> 00:19:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's a flowing
kind of state that's

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:84%
highly observant and aware
but yet calm and balanced.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's a measurable state.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to show you
some information about how

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:90%
that's measured very soon.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.078 align:middle line:90%
But it's a measurable state.

00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
heart-centric techniques

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that we have at
HeartMath are designed

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to increase your coherence, so
that you enter a state where

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
you have the ability to
make better decisions,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:84%
to relate to people
differently, to better regulate

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.400 align:middle line:84%
your emotions, not suppress
them but to better make

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:84%
emotional choices that make
sense in terms of resilience,

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
in terms of adding quality
to your life versus draining.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And coherence is
the state where also it

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:36.513 align:middle line:84%
increases your immunity, where
your hormonal levels balance

00:20:36.513 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
out, where you're
able to think clearer?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
We've done some things,
some studies around that.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.070 align:middle line:84%
People being through HeartMath
training, for example,

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and one study, a very
significant study,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.620 align:middle line:84%
decreasing the stress
hormone cortisol about 23%

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:84%
while increasing the anti-aging
hormone DHEA by 100%.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, we're about to
increase your DHEA and NIH

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.928 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a quick break.

00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, we're going
to do an exercise where you're

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:84%
going to be to see this
frequency on the monitor,

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.080 align:middle line:84%
on the computer monitor
here and see how this

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
is effective in real time in
a very short amount of time

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
as well that you can
do as well at home.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:90%
This is Lisa Garr.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Gaiam Inspirations."

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And we are live right here
from the Gaiam studios

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:90%
here in Boulder, Colorado.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:90%
This is my guest Howard Martin.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about reducing stress

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and increasing coherence.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:84%
We've talked a little bit
about the scientific response

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.275 align:middle line:90%
between the heart and the brain.

00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And now what we're
going to do is

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go into a brief
exercise here on actually

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:84%
how to achieve this state
of coherence otherwise known

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.557 align:middle line:84%
as balance, the peak performance
state, that optimum state.

00:21:57.557 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:10%
What I'd like to know from
you since this is a live show

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:10%
and that you can please give
us your comments via Facebook

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:10%
and Twitter is to let
us know how you do this.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:10%
How do you right now
reduce stress in your life?

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:10%
What techniques do you do?

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to hear
from you and find out

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:10%
what's working for you
out there and maybe

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.905 align:middle line:10%
what's not working for you.

00:22:14.905 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime, we're going
to do a live demonstration here

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:84%
where I'm going to be thinking
of some stressful thoughts,

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to do this
along with us as well.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
see how that registers

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and what the feedback is
directly on the monitor.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
happen in real time.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Before we do that,
let me explain the heart rhythms

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and what people are
going to be looking at.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: We can
measure coherence

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
by looking at changes
in our heart rhythms.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
different than heart rate.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Heart rhythms are the
beat to beat changes

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.207 align:middle line:90%
between every single heartbeat.

00:22:42.207 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And when those beat to
beat changes are happening,

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.510 align:middle line:90%
very interesting patterns occur.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.007 align:middle line:84%
Heart rate variability is the
name of the science behind it.

00:22:50.007 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Heart rate variability is
influenced by everything

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:90%
from movement to speech.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Lots of things create these
subtle changes and variations

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:90%
in our heart rate.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
researchers didn't really

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:84%
look at for a long time,
Institute of HeartMath

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
researchers did, was the effect
of emotions on heart rhythms.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.370 align:middle line:90%
Emotions affect them.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to
make a correlation

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:84%
between changes in our heart
rhythms and what coherence is.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.370 align:middle line:84%
We analyzed lots and lots of
heart rate variability data

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and learned what was
optimal and what was not.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you are experiencing

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stressful
emotion, your heart rhythms

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:84%
will generally be very
jagged and irregular.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: There will be a lot
of speeding timing changes

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:10%
going on, speeding up, slowing
down, speeding up, slowing

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:10%
down.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: So the pattern
looks like an earthquake.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: Now when you
align yourself with heart,

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:10%
bring in that
heart intelligence,

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:10%
and you begin to improve that
heart brain communication,

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.002 align:middle line:10%
you'll see a pretty
sine wave like pattern.

00:23:45.002 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So it's more regular?

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And that's
what it looks like.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's speeding up,
speeding up, speeding up, then

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.198 align:middle line:90%
naturally slowing down.

00:23:50.198 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Viewers can now see on
the screen what heart rate

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:90%
variability data looks like.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.060 align:middle line:84%
In the top view,
you have someone

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:84%
in the Institute of
HeartMath research labs

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
experiencing a feeling of
frustration and emotion.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.973 align:middle line:84%
You see the pattern is showing
a lot of timing changes

00:24:02.973 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:84%
happening, speeding
up and slowing down.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:90%
That's only 200 seconds of time.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
timing changes going on.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The bottom graph is the
same amount of time.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same person.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Now they've shifted what?

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:90%
To feeling appreciation.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So now they've gone
from a stressful emotion

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to a heart-related
positive emotion.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And you see the sine
wave like pattern.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:84%
That sine wave like
pattern is what

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:26.890 align:middle line:84%
coherence looks like when
you measure it in the body

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.330 align:middle line:84%
through looking
at heart rhythms.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And she just
changed her feelings?

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.097 align:middle line:84%
Now are thoughts and
feelings different?

00:24:32.097 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, of course.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are things
you really feel.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:90%
A thought can be just a thought.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It can be-- a thought
related to itself

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have much power unless
it has emotion added to it.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.542 align:middle line:90%
You think about it.

00:24:42.542 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling
frustrated, that's one thing.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:84%
You add emotional energy
to that, what do you feel?

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Anger.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You can turn
that around though.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:90%
You might be feeling kindness.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And you add some real emotion to
that, and you have compassion.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's the emotion added to
the thought that really creates

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:90%
what we actually experience.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It amplifies it.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:01.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now once we understood
a lot about heart rate

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:84%
variability, we
recognized its importance

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:84%
at helping people train
themselves to be more coherent.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So we created what's called the
emWave technology, E-M-W-A-V-E.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And it comes in a form where
you have a little handheld unit

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
that measures your
coherence level.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.700 align:middle line:84%
It shows you whether you're in
low, medium, or high coherence.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, great.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Low is normal.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Medium is much improved.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:84%
High is that sine
wave like pattern

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
where you're really coherent
and in that area where

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.125 align:middle line:84%
you'd be in the zone
of high performance.

00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:34.468 align:middle line:84%
The handheld can be used
portably, taken anywhere.

00:25:34.468 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
The little light on
top will tell you

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:90%
what coherence level you're in.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And you practice
techniques to learn

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:90%
to increase your coherence.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you obviously
know when you're stressed

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
because you would hit
this thing, it would--

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.885 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people know
when they're stressed out.

00:25:46.885 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is to
measure for coherence.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:50.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So you're actually
using it as a training device

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:90%
to improve your coherence level.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.227 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs a device
that says, I'm stressed.

00:25:56.227 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not stressed.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:84%
What they need is
the technology that

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:84%
can help train them
to move beyond it.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's what this does.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Practice.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Now you can plug
this into your computer.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.507 align:middle line:84%
There's software here,
which we're going

00:26:06.507 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:90%
to use right now with Lisa.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to have Lisa do

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
is connect this little
ear sensor to her earlobe.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.302 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: This plugs into the
USB connection in the computer.

00:26:15.302 --> 00:26:16.302 align:middle line:90%
It runs on any computer.

00:26:16.302 --> 00:26:17.927 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, and you
can do this at home

00:26:17.927 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
too with just your
thoughts and so forth.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
to see how it's--

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah, sure.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So connect up,
get a good connection there.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to start this.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to see really soon

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to see Lisa's
heart rhythm patterns come up

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:90%
on the screen in real time.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They'll
be off the charts.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It's
calibrating to her.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's going to
look like the flat irons.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Then
we're going to see

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:90%
these little bars begin to move.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:90%
The red is low coherence.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Blue is medium.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Green is high.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.898 align:middle line:84%
And those change
every five seconds

00:26:43.898 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
as she goes through various
changes in what she is actually

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK?

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's Lisa's heart
rhythms coming up in real time

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.690 align:middle line:90%
on the screen.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right, OK.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So, Lisa,
I want you to as much

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
as you can just go to
like a normal state.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Like you're not doing anything.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:90%
You're just hanging out.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA GARR: This
is normal for me.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: I know.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a normal state.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:03.742 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't have normal.

00:27:03.742 --> 00:27:04.784 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: You have like--

00:27:04.784 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'll calm down.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Just a normal state.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:84%
You can see her pattern is
kind of jagged and irregular.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to think
about some things that

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
are going on right
now that could

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:90%
be a little stressful for you.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:84%
It could be something related
to your job, something

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:90%
related to the schedule.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I know you have a busy schedule.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Missing a flight.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, all that.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You have to
get a flight tonight.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to do a
radio show tomorrow.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of things going on.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: You have that and
your personal life as well.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:30.663 align:middle line:90%
So think about that.

00:27:30.663 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Feel what that feels
like to you right now.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.602 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather not.

00:27:36.602 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Well, I know.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Just feel it just
for a second so we

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
can see what that looks
like on the emWave.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK?

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.435 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'd like
you to do is practice

00:27:47.435 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
that same little technique that
we just did a few minutes ago.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: I'd like you to
close your eyes, if you would,

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:90%
this time.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
slow down a little bit

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and shift your
attention to the area

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.605 align:middle line:84%
in the center of your chest,
the area of the heart.

00:27:59.605 --> 00:28:02.835 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.835 --> 00:28:03.635 align:middle line:90%
That's heart focus.

00:28:03.635 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like you to do your
heart-focused breathing,

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:84%
naturally, normally, but
deeper than you normally would.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Pretend as if the breath
is flowing in and out right

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:84%
through the center
of your chest.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.213 align:middle line:84%
That's called
heart-focused breathing.

00:28:22.213 --> 00:28:25.643 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.643 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Just keep doing what
you're doing, Lisa.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.310 align:middle line:90%
You're doing great.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Now let's add step three,
the most important step.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Feel the positive
emotion as best you can.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Make it a general process.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Don't force it.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.205 align:middle line:84%
Just try to feel the
positive emotion.

00:28:40.205 --> 00:28:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's thinking about your
daughter Kyla and the love

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:90%
and care you have for her.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And just try to feel that
feeling that you have

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.180 align:middle line:90%
when you're with her.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.918 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Her sweet little face.

00:28:50.918 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Her sweet
little face, just

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
see that and feel
it and continue

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:84%
with your heart-focused
breathing and your heart focus.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:04.802 align:middle line:90%
Now Lisa's doing great.

00:29:04.802 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:84%
For those of you
that are watching,

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.168 align:middle line:84%
you can see her heart
rhythm patterns.

00:29:08.168 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Down on this lower
right hand corner,

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:84%
you see that she's
changing from 37% she's

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.130 align:middle line:84%
been in local coherence,
which is normal.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:90%
30% in medium coherence.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And she is 31% of
the time so far

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:84%
on camera in a live television
show in the high coherence

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.782 align:middle line:90%
She is making the shift.

00:29:27.782 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:84%
The emWave is just
picking up what's

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:90%
going on inside her body.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:90%
She's doing it herself.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.790 align:middle line:84%
This is an empowering
technology,

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:84%
so lifestyle enhancing
empowering technology

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:84%
that she's able
to use now to help

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:84%
train herself to know with
this coherent state feels like.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So she can recreate it in
the midst of a busy day.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's
what she's doing.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's stop and talk
about what we see here.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.665 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That was really cool.

00:29:50.665 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And the most powerful
thing about that is that,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:84%
did you see how fast
I was able to do that?

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
second time I've done.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And the really cool thing is
that my coherence level already

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.220 align:middle line:90%
increased.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So just by practicing
that twice now,

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.982 align:middle line:84%
I already became higher
on the coherence scale.

00:30:08.982 --> 00:30:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:84%
See, over here is
where you started.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.238 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
have your normal pattern.

00:30:13.238 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You're in the midst of
your an interview, right?

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Frenzy.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And then
here, we begin

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:90%
to move into the technique.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And you do your heart
focused breathing.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you started
adding the positive emotion

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.515 align:middle line:90%
about right in here.

00:30:24.515 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And what that's happening is
it's creating that sine wave

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.620 align:middle line:84%
pattern that we saw in
the previous graph of what

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:84%
coherence looks
like in your body.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.378 align:middle line:84%
Now what I want you
to know about this.

00:30:34.378 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
There are many
benefits to coherence.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But one of the major
benefits is this.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Stress and conherence
can't be in the same room.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.563 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: At the same time, right?

00:30:41.563 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So coherence can
cancel out a lot of that stress

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:90%
that we experience.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.768 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
for everybody

00:30:46.768 --> 00:30:48.817 align:middle line:84%
listening and viewing
to knows is that, how

00:30:48.817 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:90%
do you manage your stress?

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, one way to look
at that would be you

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.740 align:middle line:84%
learn to increase
your coherence.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And you do that by
making emotional shifts

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:90%
with inside yourself.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So coherence is
the antidote to drama.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is the
antidote to stress.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Coherence is the
antidote to anger.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the antidote to many
things, many things that

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:90%
cause us stress in our lives.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And coherence
is an aspect of heart.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the
things we've all

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.180 align:middle line:84%
learned about heart
over the years,

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:84%
about a change of heart
changes everything.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:84%
This is given
empirical understanding

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:90%
of that whole process.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.497 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, so let's make
this practical for people.

00:31:21.497 --> 00:31:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So Kristin from
Facebook is saying,

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:84%
how does she get
in a positive state

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.780 align:middle line:84%
if she's reluctant
to doing something.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.710 align:middle line:90%
So she's in reluctance.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.170 align:middle line:90%
She has to do.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:90%
How does she get to this state?

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: OK.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: There's
a state that you

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:84%
can get to that's sort of an
interim but very powerful.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's a state
that we call neutral.

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And neutral, that sounds
kind of bland, like neutral.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, neutral is a place that's
highly observant and very aware

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.050 align:middle line:90%
but not yet deciding.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.030 align:middle line:90%
It's being neutral.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like in a car when
you shift gears on a stick--

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: --you have
to go through neutral

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.700 align:middle line:84%
to go from one
gear to the other.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.070 align:middle line:90%
So you're suspending that.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.153 align:middle line:90%
You're reluctant to do it.

00:32:00.153 --> 00:32:02.445 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you
know you're going to have to.

00:32:02.445 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:10%
So you find this neutral
place inside yourself

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.610 align:middle line:10%
where you're neutralizing
some of the dread or some

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:10%
of the drama associated
with having to do it.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:84%
It sets the stage for the
shift to occur within our self.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So there are many things
in life we can't just--

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Control, right.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Control and shift.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.112 align:middle line:84%
And as I said earlier, I'm both
an optimist and a pragmatist,

00:32:19.112 --> 00:32:19.912 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:19.912 --> 00:32:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Pragmatically
speaking, there are

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:84%
things that come up, depending
upon the emotional charge

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.280 align:middle line:84%
associated with that, depending
upon the history of the emotion

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:84%
associated with it,
that just aren't

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:90%
going to shift just like that.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: But we
work towards that.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's progress
we can make.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And the journey is
shorter than people think.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Exactly.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends who's
a motivational speaker

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.063 align:middle line:84%
speaks all over the world that
I interviewed on my radio show,

00:32:43.063 --> 00:32:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and he said, all over the world,
he goes to different audiences

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and asks, what is the number
one thing that you want?

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Consistently across the world,
it's more focus, more focus.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Even above wealth and
relationships, it's focus.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a way to
achieve that type of focus.

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a way to get to that
but in such a shorter amount

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:90%
of time, which I really love.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Because in a weird
way, it appeals

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.006 align:middle line:84%
to the whole instant
satisfaction.

00:33:12.006 --> 00:33:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's in
the reverse effect.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.912 align:middle line:84%
So now, what does something
like this do on a global scale?

00:33:19.912 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, gosh, part
of HeartMath and Institute

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
of HeartMath's
initiative is something

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:84%
called the Globe Coherence
Initiative, which I'm

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.700 align:middle line:90%
a steering committee member of.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.020 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned that earlier.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:90%
This is a great project.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.628 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing people together
from all around the world.

00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:35.920 align:middle line:84%
We have people that are
members of the Global Coherence

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Initiative from over
85 countries now.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a science-based
initiative designed

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:46.000 align:middle line:84%
to utilize the power of our
collective love and care

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and heart to effect changes in
the world in a positive way.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: There are
many organizations that

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.507 align:middle line:90%
are doing something similar.

00:33:52.507 --> 00:33:54.760 align:middle line:10%
And we applaud
all those efforts.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.520 align:middle line:10%
Ours is you find it
at glcoherence.org.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:10%
Membership is free.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Great.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.770 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: And what we do is
we offer coherence building

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:10%
suggestions and techniques.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Although, we recognize
and acknowledge and accept

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.068 align:middle line:84%
any belief system and any
methodology somebody's using.

00:34:10.068 --> 00:34:12.360 align:middle line:10%
But what we're trying to do
is to bring people together

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.960 align:middle line:10%
to create a more coherent
community of many thousands

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:10%
of people, to use
that collective care

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:10%
and our intention
to effect changes

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:10%
in the energetic
fields of the planet.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.163 align:middle line:10%
The thing can impact
society in a positive way.

00:34:26.163 --> 00:34:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Intention's a
powerful word there too.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you can really,
with this field that's

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
emanated from our heart space,
you can intend in that field.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And I always say it has to
be with goodwill, of course.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So to be able to intend
forward with helping

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
with natural disasters,
people that are in war

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.719 align:middle line:84%
torn areas, poverty, hunger,
clean water, all of that

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.582 align:middle line:90%
can be affected with these--

00:34:53.582 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Really? with.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:55.860 align:middle line:90%
These thought patterns?

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:90%
We think so.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Now wouldn't it be nice if
we knew that for sure, right?

00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's part of
why we're bringing science

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.978 align:middle line:84%
to this which is one
of the things that's

00:35:01.978 --> 00:35:04.110 align:middle line:90%
part of what HeartMath does.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Researchers at the
Institute of HeartMath

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
have developed technology that
can measure subtle changes

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.200 align:middle line:90%
in the Earth's energetic field.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.590 align:middle line:90%
So the Earth is a living system.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:90%
It produces fields too.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:10%
The two primary fields
are the geomagnetic field,

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:10%
which a compass measures.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.890 align:middle line:10%
There's also a field know
called the ionosphere,

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.083 align:middle line:10%
which is a protective layer
just above the atmosphere.

00:35:24.083 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:84%
These energetic
fields, again, are

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.050 align:middle line:84%
part of the Earth
as a living system.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.160 align:middle line:84%
They are protective
fields that shield us

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.500 align:middle line:84%
from things like solar
radiation and solar winds

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and cosmic rays.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Without these fields,
life doesn't exist.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: They're
measurable, these fields?

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: They're measurable.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.302 align:middle line:10%
And they change and
fluctuate all the time.

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:39.780 align:middle line:10%
So it's very complex science.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:10%
But the technology
that has been developed

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.770 align:middle line:10%
is a technology that can measure
subtle changes in these fields.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:50.098 align:middle line:84%
We will eventually have 12
monitoring sites positioned

00:35:50.098 --> 00:35:51.390 align:middle line:90%
strategically around the world.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have three, one
in northern California,

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.870 align:middle line:84%
one in the United Kingdom,
and one in Saudi Arabia.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Two more are coming
soon, northern Canada

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and New Zealand.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's the
difference between what

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:84%
they're measuring in these
various parts of the world?

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Well, we don't know.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking
at changes that

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.530 align:middle line:90%
are feeding back to our lab.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:09.582 align:middle line:90%
And they do fluctuate.

00:36:09.582 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
As I said, there's
a lot of science

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.582 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
natural things that

00:36:12.582 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:90%
go on that affect the fields.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.680 align:middle line:84%
What we're really trying to
look at is a hypothesis we have.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: OK.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIN: The hypothesis
is that strong emotion,

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:10%
collective emotion, generated
by humanity, whether that's

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.740 align:middle line:10%
positive or negative,
has a measurable impact

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.730 align:middle line:10%
on these fields.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.690 align:middle line:84%
If we can make a causal
link between emotion

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and what people are
feeling at a mass level

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and impact on a field that
the Earth produces itself,

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that's a heck of a connection
that has never been made.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.660 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.077 align:middle line:84%
And then if we can learn to
harness that in a certain way,

00:36:42.077 --> 00:36:43.903 align:middle line:84%
to bring about more
collective coherence

00:36:43.903 --> 00:36:45.570 align:middle line:84%
through things like
the Global Coherence

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Initiative and our members.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And increase that coherence
individually and collective,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and then use that
through intention,

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:56.060 align:middle line:84%
through heart-based intention,
to impact the fields in a way

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that those fields will
then impact society

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:58.690 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.315 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How many
people are we talking?

00:37:00.315 --> 00:37:05.028 align:middle line:84%
Like how many people would it
need to create world peace?

00:37:05.028 --> 00:37:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, certainly to
facilitate the ongoingness

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of unfolding world
peace, for example,

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:84%
we think about 350,000
people who are operating

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.890 align:middle line:90%
at another level of coherence.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, they've increased
their own coherence level.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.033 align:middle line:84%
350,000 can make a
heck of an impact.

00:37:18.033 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That are practicing.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.617 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's
one of our goals.

00:37:20.617 --> 00:37:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, using the
emWaves and things like that

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.360 align:middle line:84%
can help train people to get to
that next level of coherence.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And really, we have a
lot of people involved

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:84%
in this that are
on our committees,

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.580 align:middle line:84%
like Gregg Braden
and Lynne McTaggart

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and Jack Canfield and Marci
Shimoff, people like that.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And as Jack said to
me one day, he said,

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.880 align:middle line:84%
this could be the
greatest experiment

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.500 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the world to prove

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:84%
that all of our
thoughts, our prayers

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and intentions or meditations
have been making a difference

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and have an energy
that goes out.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Which is exactly why
we wanted you on Gaiam TV

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.300 align:middle line:84%
because we wanted to
get this information out

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to people watching
to say, first of all,

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.610 align:middle line:84%
you can make a difference
in your own life, which

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
will impact your families
and your relationships

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.990 align:middle line:90%
and your work and your health.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Taking that to the next level,
you can make a difference.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really can
be the solution and part

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle line:90%
to a bigger whole.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.660 align:middle line:90%
You can make a big difference.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: That's
a great summary.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:84%
We have a program for
people to learn HeartMath

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:90%
from their home.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It's an online program with
interactive phone calls

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.560 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's called heart mastery.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The tagline to that is
find your heart purpose,

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.560 align:middle line:90%
help create a better world.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's both, like you said.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like how do we
improve ourselves?

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Starting here.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.903 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: How do we
reduce our stress?

00:38:32.903 --> 00:38:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't do that,
then all this other stuff

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:37.300 align:middle line:90%
is just aspiration.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:10%
But we have to deal
with the reality of what

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.830 align:middle line:10%
we're going through day to day.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.530 align:middle line:10%
But we can take it beyond that
in the collective consciousness

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.697 align:middle line:10%
and all the way into something
like Global Coherence

00:38:45.697 --> 00:38:49.110 align:middle line:10%
Initiative, which is one of the
things I really love about all

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.420 align:middle line:10%
the work that my
colleagues at HeartMath

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.160 align:middle line:10%
do is that we take it
from down here to up here.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.585 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And as Doc
Childre has a line

00:38:56.585 --> 00:38:59.610 align:middle line:84%
he has used for years about
we try to bring things

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.030 align:middle line:90%
from sky to street.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: From the understanding
of the philosophies

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and the spirituality and things
like that but to ground it out

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.970 align:middle line:84%
into places that can make
a difference in the quality

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:90%
of a human being's existence.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would love our
viewers to play along here.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to do another,
if we can, an ease

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.027 align:middle line:90%
technique, another technique.

00:39:17.027 --> 00:39:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And I want you all to experience
this with us if you can

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and then comment back to
us on Facebook and Twitter.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Let us know.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
do a quick exercise.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So just get into a place where
you can relax a little bit.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.757 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:39:29.757 --> 00:39:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Howard is going to take
us through this technique.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.298 align:middle line:84%
And when you open
your eyes, I want

00:39:33.298 --> 00:39:35.380 align:middle line:90%
you to give us your feeling.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.940 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: So here's the thing.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a technique
that I use a lot.

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.060 align:middle line:90%
It's simple again.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.810 align:middle line:84%
We have simple
techniques at HeartMath

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.340 align:middle line:84%
that have been reduced
from complexity to fit

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.342 align:middle line:90%
the pace of modern living.

00:39:48.342 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about
different emotions

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.900 align:middle line:84%
as frequencies of
energies, there's

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.700 align:middle line:84%
a difference between
what care feels like

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and what appreciation
feels like.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting, yeah.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.397 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: In this
case, what we're

00:39:58.397 --> 00:40:01.150 align:middle line:84%
talking about is
a feeling of ease.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you what ease is.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.960 align:middle line:90%
It uses really this--

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.800 align:middle line:84%
it's an energetic frequency
that you can access.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:84%
That gives you the
ability to use the heart

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:84%
to help guide the mind and
emotions as we navigate

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.160 align:middle line:90%
daily life.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So he's bringing the heart
back to play to that.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And heart's perspective
and opinion on that.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a flow state really.

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a
flowing state that

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.470 align:middle line:84%
helps to take the rough
edges off of life,

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.980 align:middle line:90%
takes the corners off of life.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Sounds good.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: It begins
to give us the ability

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.360 align:middle line:84%
to flow and have more of
a relationship to life

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that's less stressful and
less edgy and less resistant

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a doorway really
into a new intelligence

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:42.650 align:middle line:90%
we have within ourselves.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: And it's
very simple to do.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's do it
together right now.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, let's
do it together.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.808 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Step one is to
really go ahead and acknowledge

00:40:49.808 --> 00:40:51.100 align:middle line:90%
whatever stress you're feeling.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.360 align:middle line:10%
It's not bad to have stress.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.230 align:middle line:10%
We all have it.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.270 align:middle line:10%
So go ahead and acknowledge
the feelings of any stress

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:56.170 align:middle line:10%
that you have.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.940 align:middle line:10%
They can be the angers,
the frustrations,

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.220 align:middle line:10%
the disappointments, the
feelings of overwhelm,

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.050 align:middle line:10%
the mental overload
people go through.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:04.390 align:middle line:90%
All those things would be OK.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:05.710 align:middle line:90%
They're all part of stress.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.377 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
to slow down enough

00:41:07.377 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that it's
going on and admit it.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we can do this
in like three minutes right?

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's right.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The second is
to focus your attention

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:84%
in the area of the heart
just like you did before,

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.605 align:middle line:84%
the area in the
center of the chest,

00:41:17.605 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and to breathe
through that area,

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.605 align:middle line:84%
the heart-focused
breathing that we did

00:41:20.605 --> 00:41:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and when you were
doing the emWave.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: So focus and
breathe just a little bit

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.863 align:middle line:84%
through the area in the
center of the chest.

00:41:26.863 --> 00:41:35.110 align:middle line:90%


00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.885 align:middle line:84%
And now I'd like
you to continue with

00:41:36.885 --> 00:41:39.510 align:middle line:84%
that heart-focused breathing but
try to feel a feeling of ease.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a nice sort of
silky, liquid feeling,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.607 align:middle line:84%
a gentle feeling
that you can find.

00:41:48.607 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:84%
It takes a little
practice to find it.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.398 align:middle line:84%
I'm still working on it,
still learning more about it

00:41:52.398 --> 00:41:55.110 align:middle line:84%
every single day, and tuning
into different aspects of ease

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.720 align:middle line:84%
but just find as much of this
feeling of ease within yourself

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.640 align:middle line:84%
as you can right now and just
breathe that feeling in and out

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.015 align:middle line:84%
through the center
of your chest.

00:42:02.015 --> 00:42:04.455 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just give yourself a
little permission to feel it.

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:05.848 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Just feel it.

00:42:05.848 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, give yourself permission.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:90%
It's there for us.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.408 align:middle line:84%
And just feel that feeling
of ease in yourself.

00:42:11.408 --> 00:42:16.010 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.263 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A little bit more.

00:42:17.263 --> 00:42:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Because we're
doing this in a certain time

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:22.460 align:middle line:84%
frame with live TV, we can't
go on with it too long.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:10%
But what I'd like
you to do is to try

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:10%
to take whatever you got from
that very, very brief exercise

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:10%
and to hold onto that and
to then bring it forward

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.368 align:middle line:10%
into whatever you do next
in your daily activities

00:42:33.368 --> 00:42:34.910 align:middle line:10%
as we go through
the rest of our show

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:10%
and then whatever you do after--

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: The rest of your day.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.111 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: After your day and
your evening, wherever you are,

00:42:38.111 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.047 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Making dinner.

00:42:39.047 --> 00:42:39.847 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Yeah.

00:42:39.847 --> 00:42:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Try to go back and
find that feeling again

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and just breathe
it through the area

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.540 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the chest.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I start my day by trying to
find that feeling inside myself.

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Sit down for about 15
minutes with emWave

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and get into the
feeling of ease.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And then as I go through my
day, I find places in my day

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:84%
that I call in betweens, the
times between the meeting

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and the next phone call.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Your
transition times, yeah.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.017 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: The transition
times, driving to somewhere.

00:43:04.017 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And I try to just
breathe that feeling

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.090 align:middle line:84%
of ease in and out to
maintain a certain connection

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to my own heart's intelligence,
to increase my coherence

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and to have that frequency
or that energy of ease in me

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:84%
that can help to buffer me from
stress before it even shows up.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:21.617 align:middle line:84%
It sort of creates a different
energetic field environment

00:43:21.617 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that creates a different
situation for me in

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:24.290 align:middle line:90%
regards to stress.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.123 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a lot
of response coming in.

00:43:26.123 --> 00:43:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Sal from Facebook says that
he feels happy and relaxed.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Jean on Twitter says
that she felt amazing.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it before work.

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: That's great, yeah.

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Bob is saying, I
go running with my dog.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:38.810 align:middle line:90%
I feel great afterward.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.610 align:middle line:90%
That's how he relaxes.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And so he'll do
this-- yeah, it'll--

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:42.943 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTIN: Fantastic.

00:43:42.943 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Put you-- will
it put him in a zone?

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTIN: Well, yeah,
it certainly helps.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.902 align:middle line:84%
He's already going into
more of a coherent zone

00:43:47.902 --> 00:43:49.610 align:middle line:84%
because he enjoys that
walk with his dog.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But if he preps,
prepares for that

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:53.760 align:middle line:84%
walk by doing the
ease technique,

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.830 align:middle line:84%
he can enhance that
experience even more.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I really truly
want you to experience

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:84%
this more and more as you go
throughout the rest of your day

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.070 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow.

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Just remember this.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Remember that in just a
period of three minutes,

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.450 align:middle line:84%
you can achieve a
state of coherence that

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:12.860 align:middle line:84%
puts you in that place
