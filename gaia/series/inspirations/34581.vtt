00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Hi I'm Lisa Garr, host
of "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:10%
I've always been a really
big fan of the body

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:10%
and its innate
ability to heal itself

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:10%
if we give it the chance.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:90%
But what does that really mean?

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, my guest today,
Dr. Fabrizio Mancini

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book called "The
Power of Self-Healing

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and How the Body can
Heal Itself Naturally."

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, Dr. Mancini
says that many of our illnesses

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:90%
heal themselves naturally.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mancini is a
Doctor of Chiropractic

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and the President
Emeritus of Parker

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:90%
University in Dallas, Texas.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.753 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Lisa.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to
be here with you.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
-It's good to have you here.
-I know.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking
forward to just having

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:90%
this conversation with you.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.411 align:middle line:84%
Because I know what a fanatic
you are in being healthy.

00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I wish more people
will find health something

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:10%
valuable in their lives.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.335 align:middle line:10%
Because it can really open up
all kinds of opportunities.

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:90%
It's changing so much too.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've seen
that from past generations

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
to now, where I just,
in the next 50 years,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
can't wait to see where we
are in our state of health

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
with all of the new awarenesses
that are coming about.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But yours is the most
important that I think.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Because it is about
our ability to restore

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
our bodies to a natural
state of homeostasis.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So tell me about that
phrase that you said,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that our body can
naturally heal itself.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:10%
Well what happens
typically is that we've

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:10%
been conditioned to
always look for health

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:10%
outside of ourselves.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:10%
It seems like we don't
even listen to our bodies

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:10%
unless we're in a lot of pain.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've often said that
pain is just the alarm

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:84%
system of the body
saying, hey, take

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:90%
a look at what you're doing.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.564 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever you're
doing is not helping me.

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's breaking me down.
-And even we override it too.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.079 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is,
most of us, we just

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:90%
want to numb that pain away.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:90%
We want it to just go away.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
We look at it as an enemy
instead of a close friend

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to warn
us that perhaps we're

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:90%
going in the wrong direction.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk
about generations,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right now the biggest
issue is that our mortality

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:90%
rate is getting bigger.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:90%
So we're living longer.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Longer.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge is who wants
to live longer if your quality

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of life is going to be poor?
Right?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have a lot of people
in their 60s right now that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
really have to take multiple
medications just to make it

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
through the day, cannot be
active, have retired, but now

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
have no health to enjoy it.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to
end up in the same way.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what the
state of our health care system

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:90%
is going to be.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So we need to take
this and empower

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:90%
ourselves to do it on our own.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
key word, empower.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel that most of us
are feeling disempowered,

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
because we feel that
our health is not really

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:90%
a responsibility or our power.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And all I'm asking is,
look, the more you learn

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
about the human body, the more
you learn that we are designed

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:90%
to heal ourselves naturally.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:90%
We have systems in place.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Like, we have an
immune system that

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:84%
is stronger than any pill or
medication that you can have.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And that immune system
is set up to fight

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
any bacteria or viruses that
you come in contact with.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of those
bacterias or viruses

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
live within ourselves but we
never feel any symptoms of it.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
It's only when our
immune system is low,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:90%
that now it becomes an issue.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then now we have
to deal with it.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And many of us think, oh,
it has to be an antibiotic.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But why not build
your own antibiotic?

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Why not feed your
body the right things?

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Why not move your body
and all of those things

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
are actually the
ones that stimulate

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.695 align:middle line:90%
the immune system in the body.

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Does the immune system,
as its conquering

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
those bacterias in the body,
is that what keeps it stronger,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
that natural
conquering ability--

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
it's like a natural workout
for the immune system?

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a very good point.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It's because our bodies
have the ability to have

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:90%
what you call antibodies.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And we can produce them anytime.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like a bunch
of construction workers

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
that you're hiring any time
that you have a project.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the project is, let's say
that you have an invading agent

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:90%
such as a virus walking in.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Like we have some
kind of cold, right,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
a virus that is sweeping our
classrooms and then our bodies

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:84%
naturally make those
antibodies to fight it.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
And it is a work
out for the body

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
because it has the
ability to bring in a crew

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
together and work very
hard to repair the tissue

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and to fight it.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But then once a virus is
fought, then it goes away

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes
back into that state

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:90%
of homeostasis or balance.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it's not in a constant
state of producing antibodies.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is that when we
have an environment that we're

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
constantly surrounded
by things that are not

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.050 align:middle line:84%
helpful to the body, then
our bodies break down

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
designed to keep

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
fighting or keep
repairing tissue

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
for long term, only short term.
-OK.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So that explains it, why
the immune system over time

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:84%
gets bludgeoned and
it just wears out.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
with chronic illnesses.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:84%
As you know, over 80% of
our health diseases today

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
have chronicity, meaning
that they're long term

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and medications have now
found the answer to them,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
because the challenge is that
once that inflammation builds

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:84%
in, that information then
prevents the body from actually

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
being able to heal, whether
it's rheumatoid arthritis

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
diabetes or whether it's

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:90%
heart disease in some way.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And all we're
saying is this, when

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
you apply some things such as
healthy eating into the place,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
so the food that you
eat has the ability

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to be a reinforcement, the
fuel that you give your body

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to crank up those
antibodies and crank up

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
all those healthy
behaviors that the body

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:90%
is designed to be anyway.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And kind of give it a fresh
start, because our bodies

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:90%
are constantly regenerating.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So just because you feel like
your body's not doing it right

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:84%
now, it doesn't mean it can't
do it two months from now,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.659 align:middle line:84%
three months from now.
-OK.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a, that
didn't work for me now.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:90%
It'll never work again.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens a lot
of times, we block ourselves

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I've had this
chronic pain for two years.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's evaluate what got
us there in the first place

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and what can I do different in
order to make sure that I end

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:90%
up with a different outcome?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So I've heard a
statistic recently saying

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that the placebo effect is--
you might know this better

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%
than I do, 20%, 50% effective?

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:90%
What is--

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect
in my opinion,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
amazing things,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
because what is this placebo
effect for those of you

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:90%
that may not know.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect is actually
when you would trick a patient

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that they're
giving you something that has

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
chemistry in it, but it's
really just a sugar pillow

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:90%
or it's got nothing.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And your belief system,
which is that I think

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:84%
this is going to
help me actually

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
helps over 50% of
those patients.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:90%
50%, wow.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that
if that is the case,

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
then why don't we utilize
that analogy in everything

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.900 align:middle line:84%
in our lives and just trust
that the body has the capability

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
of healing, instead
of thinking, oh, I

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
have to have some
kind of shot in order

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
for me to be able
to fight a cold?

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Why not trust in your body that
your body has an immune system

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:84%
ready to fight that
cold whenever it comes,

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
not only once a year,
but throughout the year.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And why not feed
that body or exercise

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
or begin to think
more positively.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so many studies
have shown that when we think

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
optimistically our
bodies heal up to 40%

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.885 align:middle line:90%
faster than when we don't.

00:07:34.885 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's what your whole
concept of self-healing is.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the mind's ability
to heal itself, right?

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the mind.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:90%
It's the body too.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And really when you think about
it like that, and you said it,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
all I could think about,
all I'm doing really

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
is reintroducing
yourself to your body

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and introducing you
to a body that is--

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Like my mind to my
body or my whole self?

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I talk
about the body,

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the
physical, the emotional,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual self.
-OK.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So on the physical level,
I want you to understand

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
that our body has
systems in place

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that are set up to actually
maintain a very healthy life.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of the
studies right now

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
are showing us that
we are destined

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to live up to 120 years old.
-Wow.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
120 years old.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the
science is telling us.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But we want to live
healthy into 120.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.040 align:middle line:90%
That's the challenge.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, honestly, let's
think for a minute.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
How many people
over 50 years old

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:84%
do you know right now that you
can say they're truly healthy?

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm around a lot
of healthy people.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:90%
I know one.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.695 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know that many.

00:08:37.695 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And she's extraordinary.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.650 align:middle line:90%
She's 74 and extraordinary.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
But she's green
juiced all her life.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:90%
And a very active senior.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm
trying to do is-- so

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:84%
what I did is I did about a
25 year study and thousands

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
of patients that
I served in order

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.591 align:middle line:84%
to find out what were the common
denominators in all healing.

00:08:56.591 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And why I decided to
put it in this book

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:84%
is because I wanted to
be able to show that when

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:84%
our bodies feel
limited physically,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:84%
we can always access
our emotions, our mind.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And when our mind gets
a little bit limited,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:90%
we can always access our spirit.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way that I
want people to understand

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:84%
that wherever they
are in their journey,

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to understand that when the
body, the mind, and the spirit

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:84%
are properly aligned,
is when you're setting

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
the environment for
your body to self-heal

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:90%
at the greatest level.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So what is one of
the things that you

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
remember the most from
your book of the greatest

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:90%
way of self-healing?

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Just an example.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it's on
a physical level,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.581 align:middle line:84%
I would say right now
is your nutrition.

00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Nutrition, OK.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Because right now one of
the things that we have known

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
is that we've done a lot
of studies that have shown

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that what we think
about the foods we eat

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:84%
have a lot to do with the
outcome in our bodies.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you eat some
food that you may not think

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.280 align:middle line:84%
is healthy for you
but mentally you beat

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.917 align:middle line:90%
yourself up before and after.

00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have eaten that.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have
eaten that, that

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Turns into a negative
expression in our bodies.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat, let's
say, a slice of pizza,

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:84%
but you're celebrating it
with your best girlfriend.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
You having the best talk
ever, then that slice of pizza

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
doesn't actually have the
negative impact that it would

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
have had if you just
keep yourself saying,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have that pizza.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to
be healthy for me.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
make me gain weight.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:84%
That's going to make
me feel sluggish.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
That's going to make me not be
able to sleep good at night.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely have done
that before with cupcakes.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Because they're so cute.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I often say to
my patients is just look,

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't you to be perfect.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to be perfect.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to have
those type of foods,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:90%
then celebrate them.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.579 align:middle line:84%
Tell yourself the opposite.
-That's great.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:49.285 align:middle line:84%
This cupcake is going to
make me lose so much weight.

00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
This cupcake is going to
make me have so much energy.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It's going to make
me sleep good.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It's going to make me
feel good about myself.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.010 align:middle line:84%
But do the opposite, because
your mind is actually

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
sending the message to
the body through the brain

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and creating the
right chemistries

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to digest that
good in either a positive way

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.151 align:middle line:84%
or a negative way, which is
what we call indigestion.

00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Interesting.
That is so interesting.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is why so many
people have indigestion

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
is because they're beating
themselves up saying,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:84%
oh I didn't have time to
prepare a good meal today.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Lately I've been
teaching people just

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to do smoothies, because
I realize in a busy life

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that I have, that I
just make my smoothies

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.250 align:middle line:90%
and I keep it always ready.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what time
throughout the day, if I'm

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:84%
running late or if
I don't have time,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, I just put
that smoothie, drink it,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and it has all the wonderful
vegetables and fruits.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you put it in?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:90%
As an example.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
For mine, you know, lately I've
been doing a lot of green ones.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:90%
So I've been doing spinach.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing kale.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing-- I put a slice
a banana, a slice of apple.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing broccoli,
because I love broccoli.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And then I blend it.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.967 align:middle line:90%
And it's just delicious.

00:11:58.967 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And no protein powder
or anything in there?

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.333 align:middle line:90%
You get the natural protein?

00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:02.769 align:middle line:84%
It depends.
It depends.

00:12:02.769 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, because usually
I already have some protein

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that I like to have it,
like either lean chicken

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:90%
or some turkey.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But if I don't, then I have
a non animal protein powder.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I like mostly protein powders
like pea protein powder.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, green pea, yeah.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.824 align:middle line:84%
And that works
really well for me.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:90%
So it works good for you.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I like that idea too.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way to start off
a child in the morning too

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:90%
on the way to school.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Great smoothie, like
you just mentioned.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.734 align:middle line:84%
Good way to set them up.
All right.

00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at this video.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
Dr. Fab giving you

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:84%
some exercises
just to feel good.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.635 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:12:38.635 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So, I want all of
you to stand up.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
This has been the one
technique in movement

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that you can do anywhere
that I have found

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:90%
works better than anything.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to put
your feet together.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
I want you to put
your hands down.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Bend your knees a little bit.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And start shaking.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Start moving up and down.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Just like that.
Come on.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Feel it out.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can do a little bit of
the American Indians as they,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.874 align:middle line:90%
hi, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.

00:13:09.874 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Hi, ya, ya, ya, ya.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:90%
But just feel it.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
You see, you can do this
five or 10 minutes a day,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
whenever you feel like your
energy is a little bit low.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
This is a great feeling.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can do it the rest
of the talk if you want to.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Find your purpose and
your purpose has to be

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:90%
something bigger than yourself.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be about survival.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be about
paying your bills.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be about paying
the salaries in your office.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be about buying
the car you want, about

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:90%
buying the house you want.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
It has to be about something
greater than yourself.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:84%
The health of humanity could
use you right now as a purpose,

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:90%
just if you apply yourself.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Make that your
purpose every day.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Ignite your creative part.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Get creative.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't think within the box.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Think out of the box.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're confronted
with a challenge,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:90%
think out of the box.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody else is
just reacting like you.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not thinking
out of the box, unfortunately,

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
you'll have the same results
that you've always gotten.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Forgive as many
people as you can.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Forgive yourself
more importantly.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, all of us beat
ourselves up for the mistakes

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:90%
that we made.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Who hasn't made a mistake?

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I've made big ones.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I tell my staff,
sometimes I see sometimes

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:90%
they want to do so well.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
listen, mistakes

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.790 align:middle line:84%
are the greatest
teachers if you choose

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:90%
to look at it as a lesson.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So look at your
mistakes as lessons

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.850 align:middle line:84%
as long as you learn something
constructive about it.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Another characteristic that we
have for most serving leaders

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
is problem-solving, healing.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
You see most of us spend
80% of our time dwelling

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:56.770 align:middle line:90%
on a problem, 80% of our time.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Most executives spent 33% of
our time crisis management.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And I observe people the people
that truly a serving leaders

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:84%
are the ones I
spend the majority

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:84%
of their time thinking about
the solutions of the problem.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
You know that Albert
Einstein had a statement that

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:90%
is one of my favorite quotes.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I say it often because
I have to remind myself

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
of that every single day.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is that you can not
solve the problems of today

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.227 align:middle line:84%
with the same level of
thinking that created them.

00:15:29.227 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
You can't solve the
problems of today

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
with the same level of
thinking that created them.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:90%
So we must change our thinking.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.880 align:middle line:90%
We must think out of the box.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:84%
We must start thinking, what
can I do right now to be

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:90%
able to solve this problem?

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the best
exercises that I do

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:84%
when I have a problem is that I
write the problem down and then

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I spend a concerted effort in
writing every possible thing

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that I can do right now
to solve that problem.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:90%
And then it's like a checklist.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But at least it
gives you a guidance

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
of what you can do right
now to solve your problem.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So my question to you is,
what are your problems?

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're making
your problem's bigger

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:90%
than what they need to be?

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Good question.
Good question.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So when people come
to you, what are some

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest complaints
that people have

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:90%
when they come see you?

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, as a
chiropractor for many years,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:84%
most people actually came
because of pain, chronic pain,

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.234 align:middle line:84%
whether it was back pain,
whether it was headaches,

00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:90%
whether it was shoulder pain.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Is it mostly back pain?

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Back pain is about over 60% why
people choose chiropractic care

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:90%
because we're so effective.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And all the studies
that we have done,

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
we are the most effective way
of taking care of back pain,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:90%
especially chronic pain.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the alternatives
are usually surgery.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And that has no effect at all.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean most of the studies
say please, don't do it.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens if you do
a surgery, then unfortunately,

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:84%
you have scar tissue
and you can keep

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
going in there doing the
surgery because that's going

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:90%
to be a long term problem.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So it you can manage
it naturally, so that's

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:90%
one of the many reasons.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But when I wrote the book and I
started getting the message out

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:84%
there that there's
so much more, now it

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
seems like I'm attracting
patients that are really

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
chronically ill with cancers,
heart disease, diabetes,

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and they're just looking
for how do they leverage

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:84%
their emotional side and
their spiritual side to be

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:90%
able to impact the physical?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So I still do the
chiropractic adjustments,

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't have
a healthy nervous system,

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be limited
of how much you can heal

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
or how fast you can heal.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But then when you start talking
about the emotions that keep us

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
unhealthy or the emotions
that make us healthy

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:84%
or how do I begin to live
a more spiritual life?

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Do I start praying a
little bit more often?

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Do I start meditating a
little bit more often?

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Do I get closer with nature?

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Do I start figuring out
what my purpose in life is?

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know and once people
realize that, it makes all

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:90%
the difference in the world.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Go beyond the
typical chiropractic

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:90%
when you talk like that.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And really to me, what
health is all about.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just a complete-- I
call it a three legged stool.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.560 align:middle line:84%
You know is the physical, the
emotional, and the spiritual.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And we need to do something
in all those three legs

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
We just can't expect
our physical bodies

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to be able to resolve
our emotional problems

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual problems.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Now you come at this from
that quite a history here.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.680 align:middle line:84%
What was the reason that
you got into healing

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was
actually a divine act

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that I was in a car accident
as I was doing pre-med.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And I landed in the hospital
and an orthopedic surgeon

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that I knew said, I can
give you painkillers

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and I can give you
anti-inflammatories,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
but why don't you go
see my chiropractor?

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And that afternoon, I had never
heard the word chiropractor.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was a
specialty in medicine.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
What medicine
were you studying?

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
-I was pre-med.
-Oh, OK.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So I had decided I was going to
go into medical school and then

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:90%
neurosurgery.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated with
the nervous system.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So I did a volunteer
rotation in the hospital

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.620 align:middle line:90%
in the surgical wing.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So I got to meet a
lot of the doctors.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
the chiropractor,

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I just got my whole mind,
my whole world opened up

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to what I call
natural healing, where

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
anything that is
non-pharmaceutical

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
or nonsurgical is what
I call natural healing.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, I decided
to become a chiropractor.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Then I studied acupuncture.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Then I studied nutrition.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Then I started looking
at energy medicine.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.875 align:middle line:84%
And all these years of
education, whatever I realized

00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
is that it helped me
understand the human body more.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
everybody has the ability

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:90%
to heal from inside themselves.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm only a facilitator.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the healer.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.221 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is the heater
except the body.

00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.891 align:middle line:84%
That is so-- I'm so
glad you said that.

00:19:36.891 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.223 align:middle line:84%
If you could just get to
the top of that mountain

00:19:39.223 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and scream that, that
would help us all

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, because
everybody's looking

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
for someone to heal
them, when in reality,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:90%
you are your own healer.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.259 align:middle line:84%
It starts with you.
It absolutely does.

00:19:49.259 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything starts with you.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that a
lot of times the reasons

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that we don't heal
is because we don't

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:90%
feel worthy of being healthy.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't love ourselves enough.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the emotions that
I found that it could be

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
the most healing
emotion is love,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:90%
but it's got to be a self love.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
It all starts with ourselves.
-A deep self love.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But most of us, our
impression of love

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
is what other people have
shown us over our history.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
If our parents loved us, then
we feel maybe a little bit

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:90%
more worthy of being loved.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But if they put
conditions on that love,

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
now we expect that
we can only be

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
loved unless we do
those conditions,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:84%
perform those conditions.
-Absolutely.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about what is called
unconditional love, meaning

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
accepting yourself as you are,
embracing your perfections,

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
embracing your
imperfections, recognizing

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:90%
that no one's perfect.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:84%
You may be five, four but
you want to be six foot tall.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But you know what, if you
talk to a six foot tall,

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.601 align:middle line:84%
she wishes since she
was a five foot four.

00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it's tiring being
so tall all the time.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And everybody looking up at you.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Now can chiropractic
actually reduce

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:90%
inflammation in the body?

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a great question.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So chiropractic, the
way that it works

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
is that removes
interferences that are

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:90%
irritating the nervous system.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And we did many studies,
especially in the '60s and '70s

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s and '90s that
continue to show that when

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:84%
a vertebrae is
misaligned, that it

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.960 align:middle line:84%
can actually create
an irritation

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:90%
in the nervous system.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:84%
That irritation turns
into inflammation.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you correct
that alignment, where

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
that now that individual
is properly aligned,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the structure automatically
affects the function,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:90%
the inflammation reduces.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And now the body can
repair itself naturally.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Because inflammation,
when it's there long term,

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
it inhibits the body
from actually healing.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is surely there
to be a protective mechanism

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:90%
to repair tissue short term.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you sprain your ankle.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:84%
You notice that it starts
getting swollen, right?

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's all the blood
vessels and the blood platelets

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that are going into
that area to repair

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.790 align:middle line:84%
the tissue such as the
muscle and the ligaments

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.685 align:middle line:90%
that got probably torn.

00:21:56.685 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:90%
To heal it.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:90%
To heal it.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's supposed
to be a short window,

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to be
only be 48 hours or so.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But now if that
swollen ankle stays

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
there for two weeks,
six weeks, eight weeks,

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.230 align:middle line:84%
it starts breaking
down the tissues.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And now that ankle has ability
to actually get a lot worse

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:90%
than just a sprained ankle.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Because now you're not
getting enough blood

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:90%
supply to the tissues.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:90%
That's how it happens.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Nerves become an issue, so
now it starts getting numb.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Now you start losing
the feeling in it

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:29.270 align:middle line:84%
or it becomes very painful
and inflammation is the key.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we get into
chronic states of illness.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And then that of course,
we start to protect it

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:34.811 align:middle line:90%
with our emotions.

00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we're
going to take a look at here

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
is your wonderful ability to use
laughter as a tool for healing.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this and laugh.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Our actions are very
critical because it

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:84%
allows us to really be what it
is that we're wanting to be.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a formula for
success that I don't

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:90%
know if you've heard of before.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But in today's time it's really
the most profound formula

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:90%
for success ever invented.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:90%
And that is be, do, and have.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is that most
of us have been trained

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:84%
or conditioned to think that
we must have first, before we

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:90%
can do, before we can be.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge with that
is totally opposite to what

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:90%
the formula is.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
That means that just
because you don't have today

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean you can't
act like you have it.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Act as if, which is a
principle that we've

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:90%
been taught for many years.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Act as if.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to be healthier,
act as if you're healthier.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
At least think a little bit
more about being healthier.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be wealthy, act
and behave like you're wealthy.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And a simple step towards
wealth, you know what it is?

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Just managing your money
and having a relationship

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.430 align:middle line:84%
with your money like you
would have with somebody

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:90%
you care about.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Not about having
money and throwing

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:84%
money away and mistreating
it because money

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:90%
is a relationship.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And the more the
relationship and the

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
deeper the relationship,
you want to harness it.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:90%
You want to protect it.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:90%
You want to put it to good use.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Mr. Jones
was a widower 75 years old.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And he came into my
office very depressed,

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:84%
hadn't showered, full
of beard, white beard.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I examined
him and I adjusted

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:90%
him and I sent him away.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, two weeks later,
I'm having dinner

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:90%
with my wife in a restaurant.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Jones comes
in all dressed up

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.820 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful suit with
an incredibly gorgeous 22,

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:90%
23-year-old woman next to him.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.545 align:middle line:84%
So he sees me in the
corner of his eyes

00:24:33.545 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and he goes to my table and
says, and says, Dr. Mancini,

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.860 align:middle line:90%
so great to see you.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I just want to thank you.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, Mr. Jones,
what happened to you?

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Just two weeks ago
you were depressed.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:90%
You were feeling miserable.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.615 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but Dr. Mancini, don't
you remember what you said to

00:24:46.615 --> 00:24:49.250 align:middle line:90%
me has changed my life.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Mr.
Jones, what did I say?

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.965 align:middle line:84%
He said, Dr. Mancini, you
said, you get a hot momma

00:24:55.965 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and be cheerful.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.590 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, Mr. Jones,
that's not what I said.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I said you have a heart
murmur so be careful.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you listen to,
that's what's important.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It worked for him,
it can work for you.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And the third emotion
that keeps you

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:84%
from fulfilling your successful
potential is anxiety.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And anxiety is more
related to the present.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.191 align:middle line:84%
Right now you're graduating,
it's like oh my gosh,

00:25:30.191 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:90%
oh my gosh.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.556 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to have any
tests on Monday morning.

00:25:32.556 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to
do Monday morning?

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety of whatever emotions
you're going through right now.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And the one emotion that
allows you to diffuse

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.400 align:middle line:90%
that anxiety is actually love.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing more
powerful than love.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of love
that I'm talking about

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:84%
is not the kind of love
that is conditional.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.160 align:middle line:84%
It's an unconditional love,
the same love that you have

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:84%
for a brand new baby, a
brand new baby that you have

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
no expectations except the
desire to want to serve,

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be there, to
cuddle, to love, to kiss on,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:90%
whatever the case may be.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're
changing a diaper,

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing when you
change a diaper of somebody

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.780 align:middle line:84%
that you love, like your
son or your daughter,

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.140 align:middle line:84%
it smells very different
than if you change the diaper

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:90%
of your neighbor's kid.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:10%
If your wife says, oh honey,
would you change the diaper?

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.244 align:middle line:90%
Sure, honey, I would love to.

00:26:26.244 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Ah, smells so good.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But try to change the diaper
of somebody else's kid.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.246 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
different experience.

00:26:33.246 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:10%
I want you to learn to love
yourselves unconditionally.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look in the
mirror and say, I love you.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.990 align:middle line:90%
I really, really love you.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Every day, a few times
a day, I love you.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, if you can't
love yourself authentically,

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:84%
if you can't love
yourself unconditionally,

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:84%
there will be no way you can
love anyone else that way.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So after all of the
chiropractic work you've done,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:84%
this is your message, is about
self love to heal the body.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Is that where self-healing
begins is in self love?

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing
is that you can't

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:84%
have self healing
until you love yourself

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:90%
enough to want to be healthy.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to
prepare your body to say,

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I am worthy of being healthy.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
appreciate yourself enough,

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that's when you begin
to explore, OK, then

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:90%
what do I have to work with?

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:90%
How does this body really work?

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:90%
How can I leverage it?

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
How can I utilize it
to my best interest?

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
How can I let it help me
live the quality of life

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:90%
that I want to live?

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Take for example,
you go to a doctor

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to heart
illness and a weight issue,

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor says you need
to go exercise and eat healthy.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And then he gives
you a prescription

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.090 align:middle line:90%
and you walk out the door.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.080 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea
what that means.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Where do you start?

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Exercise and eat healthy.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot
of emotional aspects

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:84%
that come to why
you don't exercise

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and why you don't
eat healthy, right?

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things that
I've discovered over the years

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that when I ask
people, is there one thing

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that you can think of right
now that you feel you can eat

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:90%
that will make you healthier?

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:84%
All of us know what
that is, right?

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:90%
More fruit and vegetables.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple, right?

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, do people recognize
that going to the gym

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:24.030 align:middle line:84%
or working on a treadmill
or taking a walk

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to help
them be healthy?

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.540 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But then the question
is, why don't they do it?

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
To me, I boil it down
to one simple thing.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
they're worthy of it.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think you're
worthy, if you love yourself,

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:84%
if your self-esteem is high,
and you take care of yourself,

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.680 align:middle line:84%
You begin to surround
yourself with people that

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.870 align:middle line:90%
take care of themselves too.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And you feel good.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:10%
And then you realize that that
has an impact in every area

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:10%
of your life, better
relationship with your husband,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:10%
better relationship
with your family,

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:10%
better relationship
with your work,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:10%
better relationship with God.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean everything in
life makes a difference

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.440 align:middle line:84%
because now you feel that,
wow, I love myself enough.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm worthy of this life.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying this life.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to live, instead
of feeling like a victim,

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.640 align:middle line:84%
or what I call survival
mindset, that you're

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:90%
just making it through the day.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean you wake up,
do the same routine,

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.920 align:middle line:84%
expecting different results,
but just surviving every day.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Just please, just let
me get through this day.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.690 align:middle line:84%
That's not a way of living,
but that's really what most

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
people are doing right now.
-Yep.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you add
substance abuse on to that

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:84%
or alcohol and so
forth, just to numb

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.810 align:middle line:90%
the pain of the daily grind.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And then it manifests
into even more illness.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.440 align:middle line:84%
We identified
three emotions that

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
actually are the ones
that help us break

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.370 align:middle line:90%
away from that sabotaging.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.840 align:middle line:90%
The first one is forgiveness.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I
talk about forgiveness

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:84%
is, you need to
identify those things

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:84%
in your life, those
people in your life

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that hurt you and
acknowledge it.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean you have to forget
it, but you need to release it.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the problem
is that health only

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:90%
happens on the present time.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:84%
That means that we're only
capable of healing when

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:90%
we're living in the moment.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But if we are stuck in the past,
worrying about and thinking

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:84%
about all these things
that happened to us

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and not letting
them go, it doesn't

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.811 align:middle line:84%
allow our bodies to be able
to self-heal to the degree

00:30:17.811 --> 00:30:18.510 align:middle line:90%
that it can.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.380 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
just let that go?

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because some of
those are deep wounds.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:22.649 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:30:22.649 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is to be able
to love yourself enough

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to realize that I cannot
keep going on like

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:90%
this unless I release that.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a for instance,
a patient of mine that

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
had a father that when
she was 16 years old,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.070 align:middle line:84%
the man was drunk, walked into
her room and raped her, right?

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:44.040 align:middle line:84%
The father never discussed
it with her again.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:90%
She never told her mom.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.200 align:middle line:90%
She never told a soul.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward it, she meets
her beautiful man in college.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Wants to marry this man.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But she sabotaged every
relationship up to that time

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and she doesn't want
to sabotage this one.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So she came to me and she
says, I don't know what to do.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm going to sabotage it.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So did she come to you for
a physical adjustment or--?

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:84%
She actually came because
she was a patient of mine

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:84%
already because she was having
some migraines I think it was.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
discussing, could there

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:84%
be a cause to this
problem that is emotional?

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Is there something out there
that you haven't let go of?

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And then she just broke down.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And she felt like she
needed to tell me.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is, I
had her do an exercise

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and this is a great
simple exercise.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I had her close her eyes.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I had her imagine, what was the
last time she saw her father.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Her father had passed away.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So she went back to
the hospital room.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, get close
to him, sit next to him.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:90%
I want you to look at his eyes.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what color his eyes are.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're green.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want you
to look at his eyes,

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm want you to
say these words after me,

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:90%
but only if you mean them.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:90%
I say, Dad, I forgive you.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand what made
you do that but I forgive you.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:90%
You've been a good father.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And probably the
father was drunk.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.550 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even remember
doing it or whatever,

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:90%
but the next day she called me.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I feel
like a new person.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.230 align:middle line:90%
She went ahead and got married.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Never had another issue with
thinking negatively about a man

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:84%
because immediately
she lost trust.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And her biggest challenge was
that she didn't want to engage

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship in which she
couldn't trust the person she

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.520 align:middle line:84%
was getting married because
her father, the figure

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that she trusted the
most let her down.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And also where that
would've manifested

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.020 align:middle line:84%
in the future physically, if she
hadn't gone after that healing,

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:90%
that emotional healing.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:84%
That's your ulcerative
colitis right there.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.280 align:middle line:90%
That's your cancer right there.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.840 align:middle line:90%
You know usually uterus cancer.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Because all of those emotions
are stored in our bodies.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
You see, what most
people don't realize

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.790 align:middle line:84%
is that emotions are memory
cells that are stored

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:52.110 align:middle line:84%
within our bodies and all
of our sales in our bodies

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:53.870 align:middle line:90%
have emotions attached to it.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And those emotions can
actually be reactivated just

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:84%
by thinking of the
emotion that got

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.510 align:middle line:90%
it started in the first place.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:90%
So I give you an example.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So you're driving home from
work one night, and it's dark.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
You have the lights
on and it's raining.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
the rear view mirror,

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.195 align:middle line:84%
you see some lights coming
behind you and boom,

00:33:14.195 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:90%
it hits you.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Puts you in the hospital.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:90%
You have neck pain.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:90%
You can't move your neck.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It takes you about
two months to recover.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Six months later, same
scenario, you're leaving work.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:90%
It's raining.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.080 align:middle line:90%
You get in your car.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:84%
You see the bright
lights, right?

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But the car doesn't hit you.
Right?

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And you go through
the same symptoms

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.740 align:middle line:84%
like if the car would have
hit you and you ask yourself,

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:84%
we have had many patients
like this over the years,

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Why did my neck get so tight?

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the car
didn't even hit me.

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:84%
It was because those memory
cells were reactivated

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.820 align:middle line:84%
by you putting yourself
in an environment

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.910 align:middle line:90%
that actually recalled them.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, that happens to
us every single day

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
by the people that we
surround ourselves with,

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:84%
by the same arguments that we're
having with the same people

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.020 align:middle line:84%
year after year, by the
environment that we have

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:90%
as far as who are friends are.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Do we have people that are very
uplifting and positive or do we

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:84%
have what I call the downers
and the energy robbers

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:84%
out there, that they just
suck the energy of you and you

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:15.929 align:middle line:84%
come home so exhausted, or
working in an environment

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that you hate to make a
paycheck when there's plenty

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.250 align:middle line:84%
of opportunities out there to
find an environment that is

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.469 align:middle line:84%
more conducive to your values.
-Yes.

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:90%
And that's absolutely true.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And it goes unconscious
after a little while.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.050 align:middle line:84%
You just see these images
and you just adapt to them

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and you don't understand
the brutality you're doing

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.030 align:middle line:90%
to your own body in that way.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
generational belief systems.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of trauma
happening in your life, what

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.679 align:middle line:84%
about belief systems that are
handed down, like when you get

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:52.050 align:middle line:84%
old, you're going to be sick,
or you're going to get cancer

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.690 align:middle line:84%
because your
grandmother had cancer,

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.239 align:middle line:84%
those types of--
are those genetics

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.060 align:middle line:90%
or are they belief systems.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Actually it's
interesting because now

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:04.230 align:middle line:84%
because of the new
discovery of epigenetics,

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.070 align:middle line:84%
we realize that the
environment around the cell

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is the one dictating
how the cell is going

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.650 align:middle line:90%
to turn out in the future.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
changing genes.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.240 align:middle line:84%
We never thought
that was possible.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.890 align:middle line:84%
We thought the genes dictated
how we would turn out.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:17.920 align:middle line:90%
That they were set, yes.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the case.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But the belief system is
a little bit different

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
a physical thing.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.150 align:middle line:84%
It's an emotional
state of mind that

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.990 align:middle line:90%
turns into a physical thing.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if you're born
in an environment that believes

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.170 align:middle line:84%
that we were meant
to be healthy,

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.670 align:middle line:84%
not an environment
that is always sick,

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.460 align:middle line:84%
not in an environment
that you as soon as you

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.130 align:middle line:84%
feel the weather
changing, immediately you

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:84%
feel you're going to get a
cold, or not an environment

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that you feel
you're going to get

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the conditions such as
diabetes and heart disease

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that your parents
and grandparents got.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:84%
A belief system is your
attitude towards life

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
is your belief whether something
is possible or not possible.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I'm convinced right now that

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.810 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
thing in self-healing

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that you must
adapt a belief system

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that trusts and believes
that your body has

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.120 align:middle line:90%
the capability to heal.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we cheat
ourselves every single day

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:84%
when we hear a sentence by
a doctor or a diagnosis,

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.960 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden
we feel that that

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.900 align:middle line:84%
is the way that is going to be
or that illness has defined us.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:90%
We're not illnesses.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:84%
We're individuals, individuals
with a tremendous amount

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of power to be able
to heal that illness

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:90%
under the right conditions.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And the most important
condition that I have found

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:84%
is to have a belief system
that allows you to know

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.750 align:middle line:90%
that your body can heal.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:84%
That you can heal, that you
don't-- I mean I'm not saying

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:84%
not to go to the doctor if
you have a serious illness,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:84%
but to try to heal
that illness if you

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:90%
can with your mind first.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Well what I'm saying is
that don't let your condition

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:90%
dictate your outcome.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't let your history
prevent you from your destiny.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Don't let what has
happened in the past

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.240 align:middle line:84%
determine how you're going to
be able to be in the future.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So for instance I like the fact
that you want to go to a doctor

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.080 align:middle line:84%
is the primarily get an
evaluation of how you're doing.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:90%
And information, right?

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, I get my
blood checked every six months.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And I do that primarily because
I find that chemistry is

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:84%
a great way of finding out
how my hormones are doing, how

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.470 align:middle line:84%
my blood vessels are doing,
cholesterol, and then

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I started looking at, OK,
what are the behaviors

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:90%
that I need to start changing?

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But before I can
change a behavior,

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.710 align:middle line:90%
I got to change my thinking.

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Because let's say my
cholesterol is high,

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:84%
but I'm still having some
of those heavy foods that

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:84%
are not healthy for
the cholesterol,

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.240 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to help me.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.550 align:middle line:90%
So then what do I have to do?

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I need to start thinking
differently to say, OK,

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.895 align:middle line:84%
how can I put the emotional
attachments to foods that

00:37:56.895 --> 00:37:58.910 align:middle line:84%
are healthier for
me that can give me

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:84%
the greatest satisfaction
but yet not harm my body

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:03.270 align:middle line:90%
or along the way.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So that crunch of
a carrot can replace

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:90%
the crunch of a potato chip.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is the beautiful
thing because our bodies

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.570 align:middle line:84%
are adaptive, beings,
your body would

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.240 align:middle line:90%
only crave what you give it.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.040 align:middle line:84%
If you give your body enough
carrots for enough time,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.670 align:middle line:84%
it will crave the carrots
rather than the potato chips.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And most people
say well, you know

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.640 align:middle line:90%
I cannot leave my chocolate.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I cannot leave my potato chips.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I cannot I leave
my fried chicken.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is if you
give your body healthy food

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.890 align:middle line:84%
for enough time,
and I'm not saying

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.950 align:middle line:84%
you have to replace
everything at once,

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:39.890 align:middle line:84%
but slowly start
substituting unhealthy foods

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:84%
for healthy foods,
you'll start seeing

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.750 align:middle line:84%
that your body doesn't
crave the unhealthy foods

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:90%
after a period of time.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It happened to me when
I stopped eating wheat,

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.220 align:middle line:84%
is if I ever go back to
eat a piece of bread,

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
it tastes like
cardboard to me now.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely is
completely unsatisfing.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I can detect if there's
wheat in something

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.620 align:middle line:90%
because it tastes weird to me.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:84%
After five years of not eating
it I can taste it in anything.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Well now that we have
technology that is allowing us

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we have what
is called food intolerance,

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that means that there are
certain foods that our bodies

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.720 align:middle line:84%
are not accepting well and it's
creating too much inflammation

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.730 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, once I
talk to those patients

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
off gluten or they've

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.760 align:middle line:84%
been off certain things, after
a while they don't even miss it.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.570 align:middle line:84%
But then the idea
of even having it,

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.470 align:middle line:84%
they can't conceive
it because they know

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that they feel so
good now why would

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.069 align:middle line:84%
they ever want to go there?
-Yeah.

00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.990 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think the intolerances
are more so now than ever

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:84%
because our food supply
is completely contaminated

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:84%
at this point and
has been modified

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.275 align:middle line:84%
to a point where the body rarely
recognizes what was wheat.

00:39:44.275 --> 00:39:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:46.710 align:middle line:90%
The way that we used to eat.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to take
a look at this clip

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:90%
here about belief systems.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.421 align:middle line:84%
Because it really all
boils down to that.

00:39:51.421 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:59.220 align:middle line:10%
I've had back pain on and
off for at least five years.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.980 align:middle line:10%
We are going to really evaluate
where this pain is coming from.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.244 align:middle line:10%
Because if the pain may not
be what you think it is.

00:40:05.244 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.810 align:middle line:10%
If you've tried everything,
but your pain still

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.620 align:middle line:10%
isn't going away, don't
give up because the pain

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.180 align:middle line:10%
may not be what you think.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And our next guest is desperate
to get rid of her lower

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:90%
back pain once and for all.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Hi, doctors, I've
been suffering

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.970 align:middle line:84%
from chronic lower back pain
for what seems like forever.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:31.600 align:middle line:10%
I get massages gut the
pain always comes back.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.390 align:middle line:10%
This is taking a
huge toll on my life.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you can do
to help get rid of this pain?

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.996 align:middle line:90%
Please help.

00:40:39.996 --> 00:40:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, Beverly want
to see chiropractor,

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Fabrizio Mancini at Parker
University in Dallas, Texas.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if he was able to get
to the bottom of her back pain.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.590 align:middle line:10%
So what we're
going to do today is

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:54.170 align:middle line:10%
we're going to really evaluate
where this pain is coming from.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the pain may not
be where you think ti is.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.080 align:middle line:84%
One of our technologies
that we use

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.170 align:middle line:84%
is called inside
station, which is

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:84%
going to tell us what the
autonomic nervous system is

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And then number two
is called the surface

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.020 align:middle line:84%
EMG where we're recording
the electrical activity

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.940 align:middle line:90%
of the muscles.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the latest
technologies is

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:90%
custom orthodics in the world.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.030 align:middle line:10%
We've got to know if
the source of the pain

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.600 align:middle line:10%
is coming in from the way
that we're distributing

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.360 align:middle line:10%
weight in our feet.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:10%
She actually has
50% more weight

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:10%
on her left than her right.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:10%
So, Beverly, what
we found in your exam

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:10%
is that you had four
segments in your spine

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:10%
that were out of alignment.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.850 align:middle line:10%
The first one was your pelvis.

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.990 align:middle line:10%
The second one was
in your low back.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:35.290 align:middle line:10%
And we notice that in your
upper back and in your neck,

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:38.050 align:middle line:10%
there's some activity where
the muscles are very tight.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:10%
So Beverly, now we're going
to give you an adjustment.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.785 align:middle line:10%
That's what makes chiropractic
a very different approach.

00:41:42.785 --> 00:41:44.020 align:middle line:10%
We look for the
cause of the problem,

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:47.136 align:middle line:10%
not just the management of
the symptoms of the problem.

00:41:47.136 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:10%
Here you go.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:10%
Perfect.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.580 align:middle line:10%
Wow, love that.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm here with chiropractor
doctor Fabrizio

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.760 align:middle line:10%
Mancini from Parker
University in Dallas, Texas

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.020 align:middle line:10%
along with Beverly.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:10%
Thank you both for joining us.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much
for having us.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.470 align:middle line:10%
And so, you've been
having some treatments.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:05.390 align:middle line:10%
How are you feeling now?

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:10%
Oh my gosh, I feel so great.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.310 align:middle line:10%
I travel a lot, and
on the trip here

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.740 align:middle line:10%
I was just like, oh my
gosh, I got off the plane,

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.820 align:middle line:10%
and I just didn't
feel like a pretzel.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.590 align:middle line:10%
Which is good.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.320 align:middle line:10%
And I think, today's show,
it's all about the pain

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:10%
may not be what you think.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So, Dr. Fab, let's
talk about what pain

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.231 align:middle line:84%
often is in your back that
may not be what you think.

00:42:26.231 --> 00:42:26.930 align:middle line:10%
Well

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.300 align:middle line:10%
Any, and in her
case, it was primarily

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.570 align:middle line:10%
her travel schedule was
putting a lot of undue stress

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:31.770 align:middle line:10%
on her spine.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.670 align:middle line:10%
But also we found out that she
had a couple of accidents that

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.000 align:middle line:10%
were not addressed
properly and corrected

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.220 align:middle line:10%
and they were just showing
up now, later on in her life.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we did the
chemical evaluation,

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.240 align:middle line:90%
in which it's her diet.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:84%
With the travel
schedule that she has,

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:90%
she's not eating property.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.670 align:middle line:84%
She's got too much
sugar in her body

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and that stresses
the nervous system,

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and that can also
create inflammation

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:90%
that shows up as pain.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one was
the emotional component

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:58.190 align:middle line:90%
of the stress.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.950 align:middle line:10%
And the emotional was that
she started a new business.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.210 align:middle line:10%
She wants to help
a lot of people.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:10%
She's got a lot of stress in
getting this business going.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And all of that tension
builds up in our spine,

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and that causes an underlying
cause of why the pain shows up.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting you bring
this up because stress cannot

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.040 align:middle line:84%
only just increase
pain in general

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:84%
because of the environment
that it creates around you,

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:84%
but stress has a physiologic
effect on our muscles.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.540 align:middle line:84%
If we're constantly
stressed out--

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.650 align:middle line:90%
we've all felt this way right?

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.027 align:middle line:84%
Where it's like,
take a deep breath.

00:43:26.027 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You take a deep
breath and everything

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.160 align:middle line:90%
relaxes a little bit.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
stressed out constantly,

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:32.950 align:middle line:84%
it can reflect itself
in these areas of pain.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And I love that you take a
multifaceted approach here,

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.520 align:middle line:84%
because again it's all
these things combined.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
brought one of devices

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.880 align:middle line:90%
that you used on Beverly, right?

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.940 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of the things that
I had to share with Beverly

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.200 align:middle line:10%
was the fact that the
pain is not the problem.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.580 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the fact
that the body communicates

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.760 align:middle line:90%
through the nervous system.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And it just lets us know that
there is a problem inside,

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:84%
but the pain itself
is not the problem.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.470 align:middle line:10%
And when we see the animation
of the nervous system,

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.850 align:middle line:10%
we see that the pain travels
all through the brain,

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:10%
throughout the
whole spinal cord,

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:10%
and it shows through all these
impulses that are communicating

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.810 align:middle line:10%
back and forth from
the body to the brain

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.190 align:middle line:10%
then the brain to the body.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:10%
But I also know that there's
some individuals-- so we're

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:10%
trained to actually
find the cause

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.130 align:middle line:10%
of that problem which
we call subluxations,

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.070 align:middle line:10%
which are the misalignments.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:22.620 align:middle line:90%
And then we just correct it.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And I know that there's
some people that

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.850 align:middle line:10%
are afraid to go
to a chiropractor,

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.630 align:middle line:10%
because sometimes they
see that the noise that

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:31.450 align:middle line:10%
is produced after an adjustment
is a little bit scary.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:34.640 align:middle line:10%
But what I did with Beverly,
is also I introduced this unit

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.140 align:middle line:10%
that is called an activator.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:40.030 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very simple unit
that has very little rubber end.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.280 align:middle line:10%
And then we just went to the
little segments in her spine,

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.820 align:middle line:10%
just like that.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.300 align:middle line:10%
And that allowed me to
correct the misalignments

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.360 align:middle line:10%
and the subluxations,
and that's what gave her

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.140 align:middle line:10%
that relief that she now has.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.670 align:middle line:10%
Because the cost of the pain
was not necessarily her back.

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:58.190 align:middle line:10%
Actually in our exam, we found
out that most of her cause

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.680 align:middle line:10%
was coming from her
upper back and her neck

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.340 align:middle line:10%
and some of the other
stresses that we found

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.470 align:middle line:10%
chemically and emotionally.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:06.727 align:middle line:84%
We are so happy that
you're feeling better.

00:45:06.727 --> 00:45:07.645 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:45:07.645 --> 00:45:09.481 align:middle line:84%
That's what's most
important here.

00:45:09.481 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in the
audience is going

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.340 align:middle line:84%
home with a copy
of Dr. Fab's book,

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:18.510 align:middle line:90%
"The Power of Self-Healing."

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So it is definitely all
about our belief systems.

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:84%
What was it like
for you growing up?

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You grew up in Colombia, right?
-Yes.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And then when did
you move to the US?

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I was 13 years old
and we moved to Miami.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And my parents
really just wanted

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.180 align:middle line:84%
us to have more opportunities
in the United States.

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we love Columbia and
half of our family is there.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But for us, being
five boys coming

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to a country like the
United States, it was like,

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.590 align:middle line:90%
wow, all these opportunities.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, my parents
just wanted us to choose

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:90%
whatever career we wanted.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Because in there, it felt
like you had to do always

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.330 align:middle line:90%
be part of the family business.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:59.920 align:middle line:84%
They had a business of olive oil
and passed us and all of that.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And none of us really
wanted to do that.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.100 align:middle line:84%
All of us are in a
different industry.

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh,

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But what it was interesting for
me is the fact that it was very

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.910 align:middle line:84%
different culturally, because
the United States for me

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.360 align:middle line:84%
was a little bit
more spread out.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.410 align:middle line:84%
In Colombia as a Latin, we
get together all the time

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:90%
and we celebrate.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And most of our
foods, whether it's

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.630 align:middle line:84%
lunch or dinner
or breakfast, it's

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.160 align:middle line:84%
all really a celebration of
talking about each other's day

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I found out
through my research

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:35.200 align:middle line:84%
is that Hispanics are
living longer now than most

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.140 align:middle line:90%
whites and African Americans.

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that
they found in the research,

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is because they have the
ability to actually unload

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.210 align:middle line:84%
their emotional stress
in a support system

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that we're finding
that we're not seeing

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.930 align:middle line:90%
that in the other cultures.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, sometimes
the other cultures

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.290 align:middle line:84%
are split apart here in
America, because we do have

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.035 align:middle line:90%
a wide range of places to move.

00:46:58.035 --> 00:47:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But in that familial
situation, you get to download

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's great and
sometimes it's not so great,

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.020 align:middle line:84%
but you least get it out.
I know.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that, let's
say you having an argument

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.010 align:middle line:84%
with somebody and instead of
swallowing and that up and not

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.730 align:middle line:84%
telling anybody, it's so
healthy just to kind of release

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.670 align:middle line:84%
it, tell somebody
about it, and you

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.270 align:middle line:90%
know it's within the family.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's interesting
because whether you meet

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:23.390 align:middle line:84%
in somebody's house
or it's a park

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.540 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, it's just you
always see the Latin community

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.070 align:middle line:90%
always coming together.

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And also in our foods, now
we may not eat as healthy

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.700 align:middle line:84%
as some other cultures,
but what we do

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.050 align:middle line:84%
have is the healthy
emotions behind eating.

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Because eating should
be a celebration.

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It should never be just
a chore, oh, I'm just

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.520 align:middle line:90%
going to grab something to go.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It should be really a
way to feed the body, not

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.550 align:middle line:84%
only physically, but
emotionally as a way of saying,

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:50.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm nurturing you.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking care of you.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing it with
people we love around us.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So like for us, we have
also Italian descent,

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:00.680 align:middle line:84%
so growing up with that
Italian descent family--

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the
food for you guys.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.520 align:middle line:84%
When we cook, we put so
much love into that food

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.050 align:middle line:90%
that people just love it.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.000 align:middle line:84%
But you can go get the
same recipe somewhere else

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.040 align:middle line:84%
that the support that
emotion behind it,

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't taste the same.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you always
hear the expressions,

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:90%
this is so delicious.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:20.370 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I've had the same recipe, but
mine doesn't feel like that.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why like our
moms and our grandmas

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:30.060 align:middle line:84%
are really into cooking
because they put so much love.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a way of
saying, I love you.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.920 align:middle line:84%
-The added ingredient is love.
-Yeah.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed
any specific health

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.130 align:middle line:84%
challenges within the Hispanic
community that you address?

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I know hat you
have a show on CNN.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, right now one of
my biggest challenges

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:48.250 align:middle line:84%
out there is the fight that
when it comes to obesity,

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.540 align:middle line:90%
we're ranking really high.

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.940 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
heart disease, when

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.920 align:middle line:84%
we come to some of the cancers,
and I believe that part of that

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.640 align:middle line:90%
is our lifestyle.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.960 align:middle line:84%
We need to be able to
make better choices.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.753 align:middle line:84%
Right now as a culture, it
seems that we just work,

00:49:03.753 --> 00:49:04.560 align:middle line:90%
work, work, work.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And then we just overeat.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Eating has become kind of like
a way of supplementing the fact

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that we are away
from our countries,

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:17.650 align:middle line:84%
away from the environments
that were very nurturing.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I love the spirit
of an immigrant that

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.900 align:middle line:84%
comes to the United States,
because whether you're Hispanic

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.800 align:middle line:84%
or anything else, because
you come to build something,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.190 align:middle line:90%
to create a better future.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And most of time they're
sending money back

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to their relatives at home to be
able to provide for themselves.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And they sacrifice
themselves around that.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's a price
to pay for that.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that price
is that emotional void

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:44.004 align:middle line:84%
that you find a lot of times
in our cultures is food.

00:49:44.004 --> 00:49:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's leading
to a lot of our obesity.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying
to really convey

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.590 align:middle line:84%
to our culture is that instead
of eating so much, how about

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:51.880 align:middle line:90%
working out together?

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.760 align:middle line:84%
How about going for
a walk together?

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, how about being
able to go to the park

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and create some
games and all of that

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:00.880 align:middle line:84%
so we can move our
bodies a little bit more.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Or how about just having an
emotional fest of gratitude.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Healthy foods.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And just being grateful
for the opportunities

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.920 align:middle line:84%
that we've been giving
instead of dwelling on what

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.170 align:middle line:90%
we have lost.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have
absolutely contributed

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.910 align:middle line:84%
so much to that
community and many,

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.010 align:middle line:90%
many different communities.

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:20.330 align:middle line:84%
You have been up to
a lot in your life.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take a look at
the life and times of Dr. Fab.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.520 align:middle line:90%

With over 20 years hands-on
experience, affecting change

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and reshaping lives, this
talented, capable speaker

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and engaging expert will
motivate and inspire

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:53.260 align:middle line:84%
your audience to reach new
heights of personal success

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and enhanced health
and wellness.

00:52:55.170 --> 00:52:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So how do you walk
your talk in your life?

00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:58.900 align:middle line:90%
What do you-- how do you live?

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.150 align:middle line:90%
What's your routine like?

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I know you travel a lot.

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a great
question because I

00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:07.790 align:middle line:84%
believe that it's very
difficult to promote

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:09.740 align:middle line:90%
a message you don't live.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that words are
less than 10% of communication.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But the certainty of living
it, and feeling it every day

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.380 align:middle line:90%
is what people feel.

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:23.990 align:middle line:90%
So my routine is very simple.

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I get up around
5:00 in the morning.

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm at the gym by 5:15.

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:30.490 align:middle line:90%
I live across gym.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I've always
taught myself that I

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.910 align:middle line:84%
just needed to get to the gym.
-Just move.

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if I get to
the gym, I can figure

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.690 align:middle line:90%
out something to do in the gym.

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:40.790 align:middle line:90%
And it could be a Zumba class.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It could be a yoga class.

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:45.240 align:middle line:84%
It could be training
with weights.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It could be cardio.

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:47.710 align:middle line:90%
It could be tennis.

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It could be something.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.650 align:middle line:90%
But every day I do something.

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And then I do--

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you eat before
you go to the gym?

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.140 align:middle line:84%
-No.
-You don't.

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:55.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I do a recovery
shake after and I

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:03.590 align:middle line:84%
do primarily some organic
berries, frozen berries.

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I freeze them and then
I put them on the shake

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:07.260 align:middle line:90%
so that way they're cold.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.830 align:middle line:90%
And then I put water.

00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I put a lot
of my nutritional supplements

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:13.800 align:middle line:90%
that are going to help me.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call
it a recovery shake.

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I incorporate now a 20
minute meditation after that.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to
start developing more

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:26.650 align:middle line:84%
my mental capacity
and be more still.

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't doing
as much of that.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I was doing five
minutes earlier,

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:32.260 align:middle line:84%
but then I just start
incorporating that.

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I start my
routine for the day

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and then I have is a
pretty good healthy lunch.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I continue working
and then in the evenings,

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I typically don't
eat after 7:00 PM.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.620 align:middle line:90%
And my dinner is very light.

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I typically either juice
some vegetables primarily.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I do smoothies just
vegetables, no fruit,

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:59.670 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
that sugar at night.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Or I may make some soup.

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So I make have some
salad, but something that

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.690 align:middle line:90%
is not too strong or too heavy.

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I notice that
that's one of the best

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.260 align:middle line:84%
kept secrets is that if you just
don't eat too late at night,

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and don't overeat, you
can lose the weight.

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.550 align:middle line:90%
But most of us don't do that.

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:18.411 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way
to start right there.

00:55:18.411 --> 00:55:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I would love to
talk a little bit about that

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:26.010 align:middle line:84%
with the concern of obesity
in this particular country

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and some ways to
even start with that.

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I know you say self
love is very important.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.890 align:middle line:84%
You talk about that
enabling the self-healing.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Other techniques on how you
can start to lose the weight.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the main things
to lose the weight for me

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.240 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that you've
got to change your thinking

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.630 align:middle line:90%
towards your food.

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you can start
looking at food

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.350 align:middle line:84%
from a healthy perspective,
like in the book,

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I teach you what to eat
from the perspective

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.970 align:middle line:90%
of preventing illnesses.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So we know that for
instance an apple,

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.600 align:middle line:84%
most people don't realize
that is one of the best ways

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.200 align:middle line:90%
to prevent strokes in your life.

00:55:59.200 --> 00:55:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And most people would never
put an apple with stroke.

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:05.390 align:middle line:84%
But they know an apple is
very good for digestive things

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.340 align:middle line:84%
If you use kale, kale is
wonderful because it's

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.030 align:middle line:90%
a great immune enhancer.

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So any time that you have an
immune disorder or you get

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.770 align:middle line:84%
colds very often
just incorporate

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:18.190 align:middle line:90%
more kale into your life.

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
best things so you

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:22.230 align:middle line:84%
can do is start looking
at food as a way

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:26.630 align:middle line:84%
of preventing illnesses rather
than just satisfying a hunger.

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:27.920 align:middle line:90%
So could you juice the kale?

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you blanch the kale?

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.829 align:middle line:84%
-I juice it all it.
-You juice it.

00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah I mean I've
become a big juicer

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.740 align:middle line:84%
right now, just because it's
so simple and practical.

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It takes five minutes
to put together.

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And with the
routine that I have,

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I needed something that
was very easy to do.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.592 align:middle line:84%
But yet again, I find my
body craving these things.

00:56:45.592 --> 00:56:46.425 align:middle line:90%
It's like a blood tonic.

00:56:46.425 --> 00:56:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's full, complete
cellular food.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is also
take a look at what behaviors

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.610 align:middle line:90%
may causing the weight.

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.720 align:middle line:84%
We know we've got to move
our bodies a little bit more.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:01.070 align:middle line:10%
So on I often recommend my
patients to really park away

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:02.830 align:middle line:10%
from the door, as far
away from the door

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:05.580 align:middle line:10%
as you can so you can
force yourself to walk.

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Take the stairs rather than
the elevator, simple reminders.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're working
in an office, every hour

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:14.490 align:middle line:84%
or so get up at five
minutes and just

00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:16.650 align:middle line:84%
walk around even if it's
within your own office,

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.320 align:middle line:90%
but just move your body.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Don't sit in one position
too long because that's

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:25.090 align:middle line:84%
what doesn't allow our
metabolism and our thyroid

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:28.705 align:middle line:84%
and all that to function
as healthy as it can.

00:57:28.705 --> 00:57:30.414 align:middle line:90%
It also detoxifies the body.

00:57:30.414 --> 00:57:31.480 align:middle line:90%
I think it moves the toxins out.

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the best things that I
do and I do that once or twice

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:37.620 align:middle line:84%
a year is I do a 21 day detox.
-Wow.

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And is just what I do is
just vegetables and juicing

00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:43.700 align:middle line:90%
and all this healthy stuff.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And just to kind
just purify my body.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.610 align:middle line:90%
And I have the most energy.

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I typically lose more
weight than anything else.

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And for me, as
I've gotten older,

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:56.110 align:middle line:84%
it's really about making sure
that I'm maintaining my energy

00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:58.950 align:middle line:84%
levels high, that
I'm sleeping eight

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:00.990 align:middle line:90%
hours minimum, which I do.

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:05.681 align:middle line:84%
Because the average American
three and 1/2 hours a day.

00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Three and one half
hours a night.

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Three and a half?

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Three and one half.

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
that's why all this late night

00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:14.960 align:middle line:84%
TV, that's the worst thing you
want to do, because the rays

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.280 align:middle line:84%
from the television awaken
your brain to the point it

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.060 align:middle line:90%
won't let you go to sleep.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get back to
that alpha and delta wave.

00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But it puts it into beta
when you watch television.

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
make you too alert.

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're laying
down, your mind is still

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.170 align:middle line:90%
going which really isn't sleep.

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:32.869 align:middle line:84%
What I would say instead,
do a meditation instead.

00:58:32.869 --> 00:58:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Put some soft music
in the background.

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself into that state
of relaxation or read a book.

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:39.625 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
just reading a book

00:58:39.625 --> 00:58:43.450 align:middle line:84%
just calms the mind to the
point of just being relaxed

00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:44.360 align:middle line:90%
instead of being active.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:47.944 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know particularly, that
you're really a good dancer.

00:58:47.944 --> 00:58:48.810 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the things.

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:49.960 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take
a look at this.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
play this out here.

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being on the show.

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And being a part of this and
inspiring us as you have.

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And take a look at
the real Fab Mancini.

00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:59.852 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this.

00:58:59.852 --> 00:59:00.844 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:59:00.844 --> 00:59:03.820 align:middle line:90%

00:59:17.212 --> 00:59:18.204 align:middle line:90%
Hello, everybody.

00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:31.889 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.889 --> 00:59:32.588 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:59:32.588 --> 00:59:40.321 align:middle line:90%


00:59:40.321 --> 00:59:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:48.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the real Fab Mancini.

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that is
that Colombian in me,

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.040 align:middle line:84%
but also dancing is
very healing too,

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.460 align:middle line:84%
because it just creates
endorphins in the body

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and you just feel so good.
-It does.

00:59:57.070 --> 00:59:58.030 align:middle line:90%
It makes you feel good.

00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Makes other people, 5,000
in the room there feel good.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.060 align:middle line:84%
-They were loving it.
-I loved it.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I loved it.

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I just want love it.
I loved it.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you're
a great dancer.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.175 align:middle line:84%
My kids love this dance,
and they said, Dad,

01:00:08.175 --> 01:00:09.760 align:middle line:90%
have you seen this video before?

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I
haven't seen it.

01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And I just learned
it the night before.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:15.270 align:middle line:84%
You did it in front to
5,000 people the next day.

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:17.680 align:middle line:90%
You're brave.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for teaching us

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.780 align:middle line:90%
about living and loving life.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, also about
the power of self-healing.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:28.280 align:middle line:10%
That's where it stems from, is
living and loving life, yes?

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.190 align:middle line:10%
Very much so.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And that we're worthy of
having the most amazing

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.316 align:middle line:84%
life that we can possibly create
for ourselves and our families.

01:00:35.316 --> 01:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
thank you so much.

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for watching my
interview with Dr. Fab Mancini.
