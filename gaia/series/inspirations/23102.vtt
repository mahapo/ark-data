>>LISA GARR: Hello.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Gaiam Inspirations."

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.460 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to you live from
Boulder, Colorado at the Gaiam

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:90%
studios here.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And since this is a live and
interactive show, communicate

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:90%
with us-- Facebook, Twitter.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of you already are.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
You've got a ton of
questions flooding in.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.004 align:middle line:84%
So keep going with
this, because we

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
want to stay connected with
you throughout the show.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
So, did you know
that your words have

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:90%
an enormous amount of power?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And the words that you tell
yourself, the thoughts that you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:84%
tell yourself, produce
100% of the results you

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.067 align:middle line:90%
get in your life.

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you tell yourself
negative thoughts,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.249 align:middle line:90%
you produce negative results.

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you tell yourself
positive thoughts,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:84%
you produce positive
results in your life.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So would you like to
see this in action?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Joining me today to help us
explore the power of words

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:90%
is Doreen Virtue.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And not only does Doreen
have a Ph.D. In psychology,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
she's also a
lifelong clairvoyant.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
She works with
the angelic realm.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And Doreen his
appeared on "Oprah,"

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
"The View," CNN,
many other programs,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
power of your words.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Doreen Virtue.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DOREEN VIRTUE: Hi, Lisa.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be with you.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Great to
be with you, too.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thanks.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me a little
bit about your background

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.144 align:middle line:90%
as a psychologist.

00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I became a psychotherapist
by going through college

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and got a BA, MA, and Ph.D.
in counseling psychology

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and started out as an addictions
therapist at the care unit

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
working with drug
addicts and alcoholics.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
My clinical dream was to work
with eating disordered women

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and so ended up fulfilling that,
both outpatient and inpatient

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:90%
in California and Tennessee.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Why specifically
women with eating disorders?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I was very
interested in it.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.543 align:middle line:84%
I think growing up in Southern
California, where there's

00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pressure on
weight consciousness,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I had just witnessed a
lot of my girlfriends

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
killing themselves to
lose weight or yo-yoing.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
So it's been something I've
been studying my whole life.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm still very passionate about
food and weight and health

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and how this affects the spirit.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how did you
transition from that

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.575 align:middle line:90%
into the angelic realm?

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
it's interesting.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:84%
As you mentioned, I'm
a lifelong clairvoyant.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I grew up seeing angels
and deceased people very,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:90%
very clearly.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And I had a guide who would
take me on these journeys

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
when I was asleep and
sometimes when I was awake

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and show me things, like the
future and my life purpose.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And my whole life, since I was
raised by a spiritual healer,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and her mom was a
spiritual healer,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was raised in
this very nurturing,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical household, I
knew that my life purpose

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
was to teach about
mind-body-spirit connection.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:90%
They had told me.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:84%
But growing up in that kind of
atmosphere, I was teased a lot.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It was the 1960s
and '70s when they

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
didn't have Gaiam TV
or the "Aware" show.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And so people weren't as
open minded back then.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I did the
next best thing,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and I became a psychotherapist,
which seemed like a way

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
to help people spiritually
in a kind of socially

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:90%
acceptable manner.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you say that
you see guides and beings,

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
you see them in
the physical form,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:90%
like you're seeing me right now?

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, I see
them-- as a child,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I saw deceased people
as clearly as I see you.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were
three-dimensional, full-color.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.786 align:middle line:84%
They would stare
at me wordlessly.

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't relatives
that I recognized.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
These were people
who I now realize

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
were coming to me because
they knew I could see them.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:90%
And they were stuck on earth.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:90%
They were earth-bounds.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Now when I do mediumship,
I still see them,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's a little
more translucent.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.141 align:middle line:84%
I need to be this way to
function in the world.

00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So that you could see the
difference between what's real

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.445 align:middle line:90%
and what's not.

00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Exactly.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.602 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you say
that they came to you

00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're
earth-bounds, were they

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
looking for questions,
help, assistance?

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, well
the deceased people

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:90%
didn't know they had passed on.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:90%
So they were stuck here.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
for other people

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.914 align:middle line:84%
to connect to who
would see them.

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And they go frequently
to psychic children,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:84%
because most children are born
like I was with second sight.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And back then, my
parents were unusual

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
because they allowed me just
keep my spiritual side open.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Back in those days, it
was common for parents

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:84%
to say it was scary to
have invisible children--

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:90%
invisible friends.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Or they would even
take their kids

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to therapists or
psychiatric wards.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, parents have
shifted completely,

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and they encourage
their children

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.789 align:middle line:90%
to keep their second sight open.

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a whole
different world for children.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.996 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's so interesting.

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:84%
You have such an amazing
following of people.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
You've written 30 books.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.372 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I think it's
upwards of 70 now.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: 70 books?

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I'm pretty sure, yeah.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:90%
I have lost track.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.266 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Way off there.

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Maybe someone will
count the number on Amazon

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:90%
and type it to us today.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my God.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:90%
And Angel Course.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.338 align:middle line:90%
You have a huge volume.

00:04:58.338 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But for people that don't know
of your work, when they hear

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
you talking about
angels and guides,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.861 align:middle line:84%
there's two things
that could happen.

00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:84%
One, they could go, I had
that experience and someone

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:90%
is putting it to words.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And oh, my god, it's real.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And other people
that are skeptical

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
would say, how
does she know that?

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.185 align:middle line:90%
How do you know this?

00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:16.851 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, I only know my own truth.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's all we all know.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage people to
follow their own truth.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm really not here to convince
anyone that angels are real

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:90%
or convert them.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't worship angels.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I simply am telling people what
I have perceived my whole life.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is that every
single human being

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
has these personal guides
with them who are there

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
to protect you and to help
you to remember who you are,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.350 align:middle line:84%
why you're here, and to
stay on the path of love.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's obvious
that a lot of people

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
don't listen to these guides
or aren't aware of them,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%
or we'd have no evil.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
The evening news would be
a whole different activity

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:84%
if everyone listened
to their angels.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing my little
part by teaching people

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:84%
how to connect with
their own angels.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.325 align:middle line:90%
Because we all can do this.

00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that is
something that you teach.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And this could be
intention setting.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.042 align:middle line:90%
This could mimic prayer.

00:06:07.042 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
It could mimic all
sorts of things.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's--
and historically,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:84%
it has been shown that angels
are in so many different

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:90%
ancient texts, right?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.106 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It is.

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It's an ancient
archetype that goes back.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Definitely the three
monotheistic religions

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.590 align:middle line:84%
all recognize what
we call angels.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
The pantheistic and the ones
that have the many deities,

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
such as Hinduism
or Buddhism, they

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:90%
recognize something like angels.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
They just have a different
take on it than we do.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But every religion has a
belief in a benevolent guide

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:90%
who's with you.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's because it's real.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of the Facebook
questions coming in --

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.194 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many
of them-- asks,

00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
what do you say about the
direction that we're going

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:84%
as a species and are we on
track towards a healthier future

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:90%
as a species?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank goodness we are.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: We are?

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.626 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I mentioned
as a child I

00:06:57.626 --> 00:07:02.030 align:middle line:84%
was taken by this old man
who is one of my guides.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And he would take me
to these-- I still

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:84%
remember how vivid these
things he showed me were.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.920 align:middle line:90%
He showed me the future.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.420 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.747 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How old were you?

00:07:10.747 --> 00:07:12.205 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: When this
happened I must

00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:14.505 align:middle line:90%
have been 3, 4, through 7 or 9.

00:07:14.505 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, you remember,
then, this vividly.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I can
still see the colors.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:90%
They weren't dreams.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:90%
These were real experiences.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:90%
But I was in bed, asleep.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.252 align:middle line:84%
It was soul travel
I was going on.

00:07:25.252 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what did you see?

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, he
showed me the future

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
of the world that's
very pleasant, actually.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
He showed me global
warming, I realize now.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
At the time, there
was no term like that.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But he showed me the
heating up of the center

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.021 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and the lava
flow, a lot of lava going on.

00:07:44.021 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And just the heating
up of the Earth

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and that the whole world
would become tropical

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and that it would create
this melting of the polar ice

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.952 align:middle line:84%
caps that would--
actually, of course

00:07:53.952 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
it's tragic about the polar
bears and everything with that.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I feel just like everyone.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But what he showed me was that
it would create a fresh water

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
supply at a time in this Earth's
history when we would need it.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the regular
drinking supply

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.339 align:middle line:84%
would be diminished
and polluted.

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And tainted, yes.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, and
he showed me that we

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
would have tropical
fruit growing pretty

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
much around the
world and that we

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
would begin to be more
fruitarian type of eaters.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the
tropical environment

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:84%
is because of the heating
up and the humidity.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: The humidity, right.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's very similar to
the beginning of the Earth,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.026 align:middle line:90%
was very tropical like that.

00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:28.969 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way for the Earth to
cleanse, is what he showed me.

00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You used an
interesting term there.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:90%
You said soul journey?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.635 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, soul journey is
when you go to sleep at night,

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and you know when you wake
up in the morning you've

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:90%
been somewhere.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
to consciously work

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:84%
with that experience,
you can direct it.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:84%
You can be very aware
when it's happening.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And most people, I
find, have had that.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many, many
people daily on Facebook

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.817 align:middle line:84%
tell me that I connect with
them in these soul journeys.

00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And I do
that consciously.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I do teaching and also receive
teachings at what we call

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.105 align:middle line:90%
"at night."

00:09:01.105 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you do night classes.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, oh yeah.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:90%
All around the world.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.601 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Free.

00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:06.744 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: For free, yeah.

00:09:06.744 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's good to know.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.618 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that you've taught--

00:09:09.618 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and you did a great
study with your son--

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:90%
about the power of words.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely, yeah.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And we were
talking about this earlier,

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:90%
about the frequency.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:90%
How did you conduct these tests?

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, it began with
me speaking into a computer

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:27.615 align:middle line:84%
and my son watching the words
to see if I was going too loud

00:09:27.615 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:90%
or if the treble was too high.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: On an audio screen.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.963 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: On the
computer, yeah, yeah.

00:09:30.963 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
recording a podcast.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I said the word
"angel," Grant, my son,

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:84%
stopped me and said, Mom, when
you said the word "angel,"

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.476 align:middle line:84%
it looks like an
angel in flight.

00:09:39.476 --> 00:09:41.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Oh, let's
take a look at that.

00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:42.142 align:middle line:90%
We have a slide of this.

00:09:42.142 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: This is from
a computer program

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:90%
similar to Dragon Speak.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.682 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually-- it
looks like an angel in flight.

00:09:48.682 --> 00:09:49.265 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Mhm.

00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:49.764 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:09:49.764 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can see the wingspan.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it takes a
little imagination,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
but it looks like the angel
is flying to your left,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's got the
tail from behind.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And so this intrigued
me, because I'm always--

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
my mind works in seeing
patterns of different behaviors

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:90%
or situations.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So I said, Grant, let's record
all different kinds of words

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and phrases and see if we
find any more patterns.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what
we were going to find.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But pretty quickly, we started
to find this unusual pattern,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that when we'd say a word that
was universally considered

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:84%
positive, the word
graph would be

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
very large on either side
of this center line that's

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.104 align:middle line:90%
on the computer graph.

00:10:30.104 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And then when we'd
say a word that

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:84%
would be universally
considered negative,

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
the word would be
very tight and small.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And we were literally seeing
the graphs of high vibrations

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:90%
and low vibrations in words.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:90%
It's all about frequency.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So this has been talked
about for a long time.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.760 align:middle line:84%
This is not new information
in terms of the words.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jesus spoke
about this all the time.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Socrates did.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Hicks has
talked about it.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And my friend-- and
our friend Masaru Emoto

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:90%
showed it in water crystals.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
But this is the first
I'm aware of that we've

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
seen exactly what
words look like.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And writing this book,
"Angel Words," that

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
collects all the graphs
in there changed our life.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:84%
We absolutely are consciously
choosing positive words

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:90%
to say everything now.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This will make
a massive impact on you.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at
what this slide is.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.032 align:middle line:84%
It's what a woman said when
she wasn't making any money.

00:11:21.032 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right, right.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So we interviewed people
who changed their life

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
by changing the
words that they say.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And this was a waitress
who had been complaining

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
that she wasn't getting
enough customers or tip money.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
being true for her.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And then she realized
it and she changed

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:84%
to a more positive
way of saying it,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and more customers
started to come in.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can see from this
graph how tightly constricted

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:84%
the lines are around
the center line.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And that shows it's
low vibrational.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And so then when
she changed her words,

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:90%
this is what it looked like.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Wow.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So she started to affirm that
there's a flow of abundance.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the huge
difference in energy.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, it
corresponded to her experience,

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
where it's not
esoteric woo-woo magic.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
when you are positive,

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:84%
more people and more experiences
are attracted to you.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:90%
So more customers came to her.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And she was happy because
she got more tips.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this is an example
of how anybody could basically

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:90%
change their language.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And basically what that precedes
is changing your thoughts

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.115 align:middle line:84%
to change your language to
change and effect your life.

00:12:22.115 --> 00:12:22.865 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Exactly.

00:12:22.865 --> 00:12:23.365 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a matter of being
conscious of what you say.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.854 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's helpful to have
a word partner, a word buddy.

00:12:28.854 --> 00:12:29.645 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Because we tend to say
negative phrases out of habit

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.269 align:middle line:84%
and not realize that it's
creating very negative results.

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It keeps you authentic.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example of one of the
slides that shows the example

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
side by side of,
"I'll never be rich,"

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.939 align:middle line:90%
or, "This place is a gold mine."

00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Where did this come from?

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.438 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: This is
actually an owner

00:12:48.438 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
of a metaphysical
bookstore who said

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:90%
she should have known better.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But she wanted to be
humble when people

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:90%
would ask her how business was.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So she would affirm that
she'll never be rich.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, look
at how low energy

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:90%
that is on the computer graph.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.867 align:middle line:84%
And she consequently
wasn't selling very much.

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:84%
People would come in, but
they would never buy anything.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
She caught it, and
she changed her words

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
to "this place is a gold
mine" and absolutely

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.032 align:middle line:84%
had an instant turn
around in sales.

00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did she really?

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Instant.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah,

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.222 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So she was able to
manifest more sales just by--

00:13:18.222 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Just by saying,
"This place is a gold mine."

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But look at how high energy
that is in comparison

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:90%
to the other one.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's
not woo-woo magic.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:84%
People like to go into stores
and homes and buildings

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.984 align:middle line:90%
where there's a good vibe.

00:13:30.984 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
We're getting more
sensitive these days.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.889 align:middle line:90%
We can feel these things.

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.096 align:middle line:84%
That's one of things I love
about Gaiam is that the colors

00:13:37.096 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and everything
about this network

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
has such a beautiful
vibration with it.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, so the
words that you say

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:90%
create a frequency, right?

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the vibration
then goes out

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and it hits up
against whatever it

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:90%
is that you're trying to create.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And then it comes back.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Is that the way that--

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah,
that's a part of it.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Part of it is physiological.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
When you say a word
that's low vibrating,

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
it literally makes
your muscles tense.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:90%
And it constricts you.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And you don't get
as much blood flow

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:90%
to the brain or oxygen flow.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not as accessible
to hearing divine guidance

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:90%
or getting great ideas.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That make sense.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.266 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So your
creativity is impaired

00:14:14.266 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:90%
when you say negative words.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.906 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this also
impacts us on a health level.

00:14:17.906 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There's a slide here
that we have where if you tell

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.020 align:middle line:84%
the difference, when you get
a cold and you're not feeling

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:84%
very good and you say, "I am
sick"-- so sick is obviously--

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.425 align:middle line:90%
you tell me. [LAUGHS]

00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah,
very low vibrating.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Very, very low vibrating.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And just saying that word
makes you feel that way.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there's always a
positive way to say everything.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can talk
about your health

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.987 align:middle line:84%
and still be honest
in a positive way.

00:14:41.987 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, what
if you have a fever

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're pretty much
feeling miserable?

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: There's a way
to distance yourself

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.626 align:middle line:90%
from affirming.

00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:50.499 align:middle line:84%
Because everything you
say is an affirmation.

00:14:50.499 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, "I have
a fever," you can say,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
"I seem to be having the
experience of a higher

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.481 align:middle line:90%
temperature."

00:14:55.481 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.646 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And just
by distancing instead

00:14:57.646 --> 00:15:02.267 align:middle line:84%
of "I am" or "I have," it really
detaches you from that label.

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: So you're not owning it.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Manifesting
it, exactly.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And plus, when you
say that, other people

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:90%
then start to see you as sick.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:90%
They put that intention on you.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.137 align:middle line:90%
And they manifest it for you.

00:15:12.137 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How could doctors
change their languaging?

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.345 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: They already are.

00:15:15.345 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
There's been so many studies
now that absolutely-- we don't

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
use the word "prove,"
but certainly

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
significantly correlate
prayer and what a doctor says,

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
especially in a surgery
room, to the outcome.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It was recently suggested in the
JMA, the Journal of the Medical

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Association, that it
would be malpractice

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:90%
to not pray for your patients.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.122 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness!

00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:90%
That is groundbreaking.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And refreshing.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I think so.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I would love to have--
if I was in that situation,

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
knowing that I had a surgeon
over me who was intentionally

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.515 align:middle line:84%
praying for the outcome,
I mean, why wouldn't he?

00:15:47.515 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Once you know
this, it's almost--

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:90%
it's like you can't not do it.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.775 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
it's interesting.

00:15:52.775 --> 00:15:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I meet so many medical
doctors, and they

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:90%
are open to all of this.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Because they see life
and death situations.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.410 align:middle line:84%
They see the power of the spirit
helping people to stay alive.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:90%
And so they believe.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
very common phrase.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes, there you go.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.644 align:middle line:84%
This is like the little
story from childhood,

00:16:09.644 --> 00:16:11.146 align:middle line:90%
"I think I can"-- "The Little--

00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Engine that Could."

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, "The
Engine that Could."

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you say, "I can,"
even if you don't believe it--

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
because we use the
variable, do you

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:84%
have to believe this to
have the high vibration?

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We recorded certain
positive words

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
with an angry voice, a sad
voice, and an anxious voice,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and it was always still the same
results of very high vibrating

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
peaks above and below
the center line.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So here's "I can," and look at
just super, super high energy.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So it would give you the
energy to move through fears

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:84%
or procrastination
tendencies, versus "I can't."

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You might as well just
give up right there.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's very,
very-- it seems

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.565 align:middle line:84%
like it's affirming
the negative,

00:16:51.565 --> 00:16:52.940 align:middle line:84%
if that's a possible
thing to do.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.675 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: This is pulling
yourself up by your bootstraps.

00:16:54.675 --> 00:16:55.216 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:16:55.216 --> 00:16:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I mean, instead
of blaming outside entities,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.231 align:middle line:84%
if you say, "I
can," you can make

00:17:01.231 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:84%
a huge, positive difference in
this world instead of saying,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
someone should do something
about the environment or this

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:90%
or that.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So once again,
it's about keeping

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:90%
yourself accountable.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder what "Just
do it" looks like.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.230 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
phrases out there.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: We had fun with this.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:90%
We really did, yeah.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.724 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This shows
the difference

00:17:17.724 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
between the negative words
and what exactly they show,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
how low the vibration is
on the negative words.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:90%
The word "addiction."

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, so
we chose as many

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
what we consider to be
universally-considered negative

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:90%
words as possible.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:90%
And so we chose "addiction."

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
You can see that it's got
very, very low energy, not

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.820 align:middle line:90%
the lowest.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.412 align:middle line:84%
And "worry" seemed to be the
most low energy that we had.

00:17:46.412 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
You can see how
tightly constricted

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that is, just like
when you worry.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Your lips purse up, your
forehead gets all wrinkled.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And it just looks
like what it is.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
We thought "drugs"
would be low vibrating,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
but interestingly, you can see
there's a high peak on the top.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And what we discovered
is because that word

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:84%
can be used for both
positive or negative.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:90%
And the energy reflects that.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This could also have
to do with our self-talk

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
as well, our negative
self-talk, even

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:84%
if we don't verbalize
these words.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.042 align:middle line:90%
It has the same effect on us?

00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It definitely does.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:84%
When you think these words,
it affects your physiology.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we put in this book,
"Angel Words," a number of very

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:84%
well-done scientific studies
about words, including words

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:30.090 align:middle line:84%
in the surgery room, that we
find have effects on your blood

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:90%
pressure, your heart rate.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Physiological is
definitely affected.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Even cliches.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah, cliches.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: "Break a leg"
and things like that.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.053 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yup, yeah.

00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So we've rewritten
the old cliches,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
which you can see
are low vibrating,

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.677 align:middle line:84%
and put positive examples of
things you could do instead.

00:18:46.677 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, people tell me they're
giving this book, "Angel

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Words," to their complaining
relatives as a gift.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a beautiful book.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's a nice gift.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.279 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you don't realize
the pack that it punches.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.164 align:middle line:84%
The idea is here to
change the old paradigm.

00:19:00.164 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I believe
that's what you've

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
talked about many
times, changing

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.967 align:middle line:84%
the old energy, the dominating,
the competitive, energy.

00:19:06.967 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
that's why we're here.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what we
all signed up to do,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
is usher out that old
energy, like you said,

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of competition, the belief
in lack and limitation,

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
the belief that
I better get mine

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
before you get yours,
and suffering for money.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
That's old, old energy
that's completely on its way

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:90%
out, thank goodness.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And the new energy is
cooperation, win-win for all.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:90%
If I win, you win.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And knowing there's
an abundance.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And that the more I manifest,
the more that I can help you.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I can help my favorite charity.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.091 align:middle line:84%
I can help homeless
people, et cetera.

00:19:37.091 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it becomes
effortless for you.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And you become a
model for us to be

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:90%
able to see something like that.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.185 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely.

00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
We all need to be role models
of peace and role models

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:90%
of that this stuff works.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of the Facebook
questions coming in

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:84%
is basically saying, how can
we use these powerful words?

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And what can be-- we
begin to say collectively

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:90%
to help the environment?

00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.266 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: OK, so this is--
just like the analogy of when

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:01.890 align:middle line:84%
you say you have a
fever, it's the same

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:90%
with the world's environment.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.652 align:middle line:84%
And instead of saying, gee, I
wish there was peace on Earth,

00:20:06.652 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:84%
or this world's going to
hell in a hand basket,

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that, we have
to affirm that everything's

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.660 align:middle line:90%
healed and healthy right now.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't mean
that you put blinders on

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:90%
and not get involved.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:90%
I vote.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I think every light worker
needs to be voting and watching

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:84%
the news, but from
a place of love.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
When you watch the
news, pray over

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:84%
those situations instead of
getting worried or fearful

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:90%
over them.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Get involved.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, see the
world as you want it to be,

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:84%
not as you fear it
might be right now.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So to hold that place
of intentionality,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to hold that place of
a higher vibration,

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.070 align:middle line:84%
to hold that place of
light, if more and more

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and more people become
consciously aware

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:90%
of that energy--

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.044 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: To me
it's when, not if.

00:20:49.044 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK, it's when.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.543 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:20:50.543 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: That
truly-- you really

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.502 align:middle line:90%
think that that can shift.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I know it is here,
And I know that's why I'm here

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and why you're here and
why many of us are here,

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
is to lead the way through
periods of darkness, where

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
there are certain
people who have,

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.510 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, selfish motives,
who are artificially creating

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.850 align:middle line:84%
recessions and wars to
distract us from our path

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.339 align:middle line:90%
and to make us forget love.

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Could it be
the more powerful

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:84%
we get with the positivity,
that the more the darkness would

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:20.834 align:middle line:90%
suppress that?

00:21:20.834 --> 00:21:22.708 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, they're
kicking and screaming

00:21:22.708 --> 00:21:24.670 align:middle line:84%
right now on their
way out the door.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So the darkness has just
about lost its reign.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And we as light workers have
got to finish the job now

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.002 align:middle line:90%
by doing it for ourselves.

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: By holding the space.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.126 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, we can't
control other people.

00:21:38.126 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:90%
We can't make anyone else happy.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But we can take care of
our own little corner

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.224 align:middle line:84%
and make ourselves
happy and peaceful.

00:21:44.224 --> 00:21:45.765 align:middle line:84%
And then if you do
that and I do that

00:21:45.765 --> 00:21:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and everyone watching does that,
then we've got a happy world.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- it
doesn't take everyone

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:84%
being happy to make this happen,
to push it over the edge.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It's very much the
hundredth monkey syndrome.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It's if enough of
us do it, it's going

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.092 align:middle line:84%
to tip the scale
in that direction.

00:22:00.092 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you
start with yourself.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And you start with
your own home.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: That's the only
thing you can control.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.619 align:middle line:90%
You cannot control anyone else.

00:22:04.619 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That makes sense.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
you also start

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:90%
with changing your languaging.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And we have this slide of what
the positive words look like.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I wanted to
follow it up with that.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.456 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:22:13.456 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so look how high
vibrating in contrast these are.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The frequency-- so the
highest one on the scale is

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:90%
"love."

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.918 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, "love"
is very, very high

00:22:22.918 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
frequency, yes, as most people
would intuitively guess,

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:84%
as is "joy." "Bliss" is super,
super high vibrating, which

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:90%
means happiness.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And the angels have told me, and
the computer graph backs it up,

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:84%
that bliss and happiness
is our purpose in prayer.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually one that
we find was the most positive,

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:90%
the most high vibrating.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Which one is that?

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.595 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I think that's--
there we go. "Peace."

00:22:45.595 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: "Peace."

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: "Peace."

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's got kind
of a double impact

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:84%
there for a
single-syllable word.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:84%
It almost in the middle looks
like a white dove flying,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.419 align:middle line:90%
which is the archetypal symbol.

00:22:55.419 --> 00:22:57.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's one
single word, "peace?"

00:22:57.085 --> 00:22:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: "Peace," yup.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It does look
like a-- so what

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.600 align:middle line:84%
is the peace, the
dip in the middle

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:90%
of the frequency of the word?

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's just so powerful
that it doubles and multiplies.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.016 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's wonderful.

00:23:10.016 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: That's, you
know, how life is born.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is really
what we're here for.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And the ego wants to tell
us that, I can be peaceful,

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.091 align:middle line:84%
I can be happy if
everything's perfect out here.

00:23:21.091 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:84%
If there's no more
wars, the environment's

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:84%
cleaned up, if I pay my
bills or the economy's

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.979 align:middle line:84%
better, if I get
published or I'm a healer,

00:23:28.979 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be happy.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the ego's big lie.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
The higher self says,
I'm already happy.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm already peaceful.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I was made in
the image and likeness

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:90%
of the happy, peaceful creator.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the survival and
the scarcity and the fear all

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:90%
comes from the ego?

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
The ego's very life force is the
belief in separation from God,

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
which is the most terrifying
thought anyone could have,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that we would be
separated from our source.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately that's not possible.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just an illusion.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I don't want to be
in this place of a Pollyanna

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:90%
thinker.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to think
that the world is glossy

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking at it
through rose-colored glasses.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's not.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not right now.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's not.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: There's things that
need to be cleaned up big time.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.733 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And I'm
the first to see it.

00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:90%
I read the news.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm very involved
in what's going on.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And I have human emotions.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I get very upset by dolphins
washing up on a beach.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But I know that if we go
into fear or worry or blame,

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:90%
that that makes things worse.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.842 align:middle line:84%
We're pouring
gasoline on the fire.

00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But when we're
subject to those things,

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:84%
with the domination models where
we're being told to do things

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.435 align:middle line:84%
or we're being limited
or we're being capped,

00:24:35.435 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:84%
it reinforces that feeling
of being controlled,

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.790 align:middle line:90%
of the domination model.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
How do you use this positive
vibration, the angelic realm,

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:84%
all you talk about, to
be able to overcome that?

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Each of us has
our own guides and angels,

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to be
talking to them much more

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:90%
often than we are.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:90%
The angels want to help us.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And each of us can
ask that question,

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:90%
how can I be more at peace?

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:90%
How can I be more focused?

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.010 align:middle line:84%
How can I understand that
I truly am unlimited,

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:90%
that no one can control me?

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Because God created
me free and powerful.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And that all of these things
that are going on in the world

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
that we would consider
evil or negative

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
is a force of darkness trying
to distract us from our path

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and trying to convince us
that we are not powerful.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we allow
them to distract us,

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:84%
then we have wasted
our time here on Earth.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get it
together now and remember

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.544 align:middle line:84%
that we are-- each and
every one of us, no matter

00:25:30.544 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:84%
how much money you
make, no matter

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:84%
what your educational background
is, no matter how old or young

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
you are, I don't care what your
circumstances are physically,

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:84%
you are powerful being who
can save the world today

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.430 align:middle line:90%
if you'll just know that.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:47.111 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And to do that--
and how do you do that?

00:25:47.111 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, your angels
will tell you specifically

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:90%
your own guidance.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But what they've told me is
the key to highest vibration is

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful for at least
one thing in every moment

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and really watch out for this,
oh, everything's falling apart,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:84%
it's terrible, which
lowers your vibration.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Guilt lowers your vibration.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Your contribution to the
world is essential right now.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:90%
All of us together do this.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And you remember the Dr. Seuss
character Horton Hears a Who?

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And it
was a little girl--

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A speck, yeah.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Right, that
saved-- the speck.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And so one person
watching today who

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:84%
makes that decision--
I'm happy, I'm

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
going to enjoy this
moment no matter

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.562 align:middle line:84%
what's going on around
me-- can save the world.

00:26:31.562 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, there
are many people

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.811 align:middle line:84%
who are commenting on
Facebook and Twitter,

00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:35.930 align:middle line:90%
saying yes, they agree.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a beautiful
conversation.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:90%
A lot of support coming in.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.595 align:middle line:84%
And I'm grateful for
you in this moment.

00:26:41.595 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We're going
to take a quick break.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.890 align:middle line:84%
When we come back,
we're going to talk more

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:90%
about the archangels.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
learn more about how

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:51.797 align:middle line:84%
to set your intention for
a specific object or thing

00:26:51.797 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that you want in your life
or feeling or intention

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.755 align:middle line:84%
that you want in your
life, when we come back

00:26:55.755 --> 00:26:56.760 align:middle line:90%
with Doreen Virtue.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

>>LISA: Welcome back.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm Lisa Garr.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And my guest is angel
therapist, Doreen Virtue,

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:90%
and also psychologist.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about the
power of words and the impact

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that that makes on us,
both of our inner thoughts

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and the words that we
say and that we express

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.671 align:middle line:84%
and how that creates
different things

00:27:34.671 --> 00:27:36.450 align:middle line:84%
in our lives and the
outcome that it has.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.959 align:middle line:84%
And also, how does all this
tie into the angelic realm?

00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, the angels
are each of our guides

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that can help us to
choose empowering words.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's real easy, especially
if you're sensitive,

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to be affected by other
people's energies, both

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:84%
the global energies
and individual.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you get into a space
where you are complaining,

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:84%
for instance, or you
feel like a victim,

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:84%
it's sometimes hard
to find your way out.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask
the angels to help

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:84%
you to switch, like
a remote control,

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
to your higher self,
where you're automatically

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:90%
more positive.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What are you
feeling right this second?

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.240 align:middle line:84%
What are you feeling in
this moment, right here?

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.170 align:middle line:84%
What are the angels
telling you right now?

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.503 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, the angels
are saying that for all of us

00:28:21.503 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:90%
to keep going.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:84%
We've all signed up to
come into a physical body

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.480 align:middle line:84%
at this time in
the Earth's history

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.180 align:middle line:90%
when the tides are changing.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like a weather change
or a seasonal change.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.920 align:middle line:90%
It can be uncomfortable.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, clearly 2012
energy is much more

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.100 align:middle line:84%
easy to deal than
2011, and 2013 and '14

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:84%
will become increasingly
easier, provided

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:84%
you let go of trying
to control things.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe right
now is washing away anything

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:84%
that is done or
inauthentic or unhealthy.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we try and
hang onto it, that's

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.204 align:middle line:84%
when we get into trouble
and uncomfortable feelings.

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What about
the things that

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.560 align:middle line:84%
are inauthentic and unhealthy,
things like chemtrails,

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:90%
things like dark energies.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:84%
How do we positively
overcome them?

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, fortunately
darkness can no longer hide.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.856 align:middle line:84%
So it used to be that these
dishonest and cruel things

00:29:16.856 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
would be hidden and we
wouldn't find out about them

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:90%
till after the fact.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Now they're immediately
discovered and talked about.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So most people are
aware of chemtrails

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and other very cruel
and evil things that

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:84%
are being perpetuated
by a tiny, few people.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very analogous-- now,
this might sound very far out,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:84%
but this is my research
that I believe in,

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:84%
that we've gone through
this same scenario

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:84%
before in Atlantis, where
the government started

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to become land hungry and
wanted to take over the world.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And we were passive.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
We were all peace and love,
and we didn't want to speak up.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And the government,
sure enough, blew up

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis with these
giant crystals

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:84%
we used to use back then, and
the sun coming through it,

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:07.520 align:middle line:84%
trying to take over
other locations.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
We can't make that
mistake again.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:90%
We can't be passive.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:84%
But we also don't want to be
coming from a place of fear.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
balance that's here,

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.510 align:middle line:84%
is that we have to speak
our truth, but with love,

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.560 align:middle line:84%
starting right with our
personal relationships.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, you speak your
truth with love to yourself.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
honest with yourself.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the people
who are closest to you,

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
we don't steamroll them with
blasting them with our truth.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a positive,
loving way to always

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:84%
say your truth to other people,
owning your own feelings,

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:84%
not saying, you make me
feel this feel this way.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.589 align:middle line:90%
You'd say, I feel this way.

00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.796 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And then
we expand from there.

00:30:42.796 --> 00:30:45.880 align:middle line:84%
We tell our city
council how we feel.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we tell our senators
and our governors how we feel

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and the media and our
doctors and our educators.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:90%
And we keep going.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is what the
whole Occupy Movement, which

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I big support financially
and otherwise-- love

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.020 align:middle line:84%
to see more grassroots
movements along this line.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And there's
a specific archangel

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that you can intend to in
those types of movements.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.219 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: That's right.

00:31:10.219 --> 00:31:11.384 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: For leadership and--

00:31:11.384 --> 00:31:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah,
Archangel Michael

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is huge for giving you the
courage and the confidence

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and the support that you need
to make healthful life changes.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people are
going through-- they're

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.050 align:middle line:90%
moving to a new home.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.980 align:middle line:84%
They're changing careers,
relationships, lifestyle

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.820 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And it can feel intimidating.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder, how am
I going to pay for this?

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Or will I be OK?

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And Michael will just let you
know that you can do this.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.716 align:middle line:90%
You'll be safe.

00:31:37.716 --> 00:31:38.340 align:middle line:90%
You'll be fine.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll be here.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's for in that
time of massive transition,

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.072 align:middle line:84%
having an intention to
the Archangel Michael.

00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:48.030 align:middle line:90%
How would you say that?

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:48.697 align:middle line:90%
What would you--

00:31:48.697 --> 00:31:50.154 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
I'm glad you asked.

00:31:50.154 --> 00:31:52.490 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me just
explain for anyone new to this

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that Archangel Michael
is holographic.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And so he can be with
every single person who

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.830 align:middle line:84%
calls on him at the same
time, having with each of us

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.790 align:middle line:84%
a unique and
individual experience.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.839 align:middle line:84%
So please don't feel afraid
that you're wasting his time

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:84%
or taking him away
from someone else.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or whatever
you're saying

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:90%
is not as important as-- yes.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: There's no limits.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to
do, really, is you can

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:84%
either say, God, please
send me an angel,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.190 align:middle line:84%
or I think it's really
helpful to know the players

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and know the different
specialties of the angels.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what I teach about.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And so Archangel
Michael would be the one

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:24.980 align:middle line:84%
to call if you're
afraid or you want

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.602 align:middle line:84%
protection or strength
or confidence.

00:32:26.602 --> 00:32:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's learn about
some of these angels.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.925 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a whole
card deck about them.

00:32:30.925 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I do.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:84%
The new Angel Tarot deck,
which-- the Angel Tarot cards

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.490 align:middle line:84%
are Radleigh Valentine
and Steve A. Roberts.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
It's our answer to
traditional tarot.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the same 78-card
system as you'd

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:84%
find with Rider-Waite,
but 100% positive, gentle,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.259 align:middle line:84%
and safe pictures,
words, and symbols.

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:51.925 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you also learn about
the archangels in the meantime.

00:32:51.925 --> 00:32:53.508 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, it's
like flash cards.

00:32:53.508 --> 00:32:56.187 align:middle line:84%
So the major arcana, we
used the archangels for.

00:32:56.187 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the different
elements, we have mermaids,

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.640 align:middle line:84%
dragons, unicorns for
the swords, and fairies.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.360 align:middle line:90%
And it goes into the shadows.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not sugarcoated in any way.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.500 align:middle line:84%
It's still the same
accurate, detailed messages

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:84%
you'd get from
traditional tarot.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:84%
But for instance, the
High Priestess card,

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.150 align:middle line:90%
we have the archangel Haniel.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Her name means "grace of God."

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.500 align:middle line:84%
She has been revered
as the full moon

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:84%
goddess since the
time of Babylon.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And so in this card, she
helps you with your intuition.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And so if you wanted
to be more clairvoyant,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.410 align:middle line:84%
you'd say Archangel
Haniel, please

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:34.510 align:middle line:84%
help me to open up my
spiritual sight and third eye.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as our Facebook
questions are coming in,

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:39.911 align:middle line:84%
how do I set intentions
with these angels?

00:33:39.911 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the ways.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So that specific angel,
Haniel, Archangel Haniel--

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Each of the
archangels has a specialty.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.455 align:middle line:84%
So it's very helpful to
know who to call for what.

00:33:48.455 --> 00:33:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's great.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: All right.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the next one.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: OK, so
here's the Empress.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And these are traditional
names for the cards.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.784 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other
card names we changed

00:33:56.784 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:90%
to make them more positive.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Empress is always about
birth of something new.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:90%
She's about abundance.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And we used Archangel
Gabriel, who

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:84%
is the messenger angel, who
in all Renaissance paintings

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and in my experience
is always a female.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I think Constantine did a little
sex change operation on her

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.840 align:middle line:90%
for some of the Bible.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it's either
Gabrielle or Gabriel.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:21.739 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Gabrielle, the female archangel
who I work with and I see,

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:84%
is an angel of
femininity and nurturing.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.322 align:middle line:84%
And so when you are
setting intentions

00:34:31.322 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:90%
to the Archangel Gabriel--

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, so
Gabriel would be

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
wonderful to call on
if you're a writer

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and you want to have more
motivation or more information.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Creativity.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:41.155 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:34:41.155 --> 00:34:42.550 align:middle line:90%
More creativity.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:90%
She also works with parents.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:84%
If you want to adopt or
you want to conceive,

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:90%
she's brilliant at that.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.152 align:middle line:84%
And she helps with all aspects
of pregnancy and child rearing.

00:34:53.152 --> 00:34:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of our Facebook
questions coming in

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:59.180 align:middle line:84%
is asking about how do you
parent a child who is sensitive

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.440 align:middle line:90%
like you were as a child?

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And how do you not
suppress that type

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.014 align:middle line:90%
of creativity in that child?

00:35:04.014 --> 00:35:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: One of
the things my dad

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.750 align:middle line:84%
did that I'll always love
him for is he would take me

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:84%
to-- when we would drive to
go to the store or the post

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:84%
office, he would
say, OK use your gut

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:90%
to find me the parking place.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And he would let me drive from
the passenger seat by saying,

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.070 align:middle line:90%
go down this lane.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And he would do certain
games like that where

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.640 align:middle line:84%
we'd walked through the
house, he'd hide something,

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and he'd say, OK, feel with
your body where I hid it.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And he really helped me to
hone my intuition in that way,

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.497 align:middle line:90%
in a loving, gentle way.

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, that's a great idea.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of them.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.180 align:middle line:84%
You have a whole book
on crystal children--

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I do.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and how to
raise crystal children,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.980 align:middle line:90%
angel children.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So Archangel Haniel
is the one to pray to

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.380 align:middle line:84%
for parenting things
and creativity.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Gabriel.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:45.826 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Gabriel.

00:35:45.826 --> 00:35:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Gabriel, uh-huh,
is one for parenting,

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.420 align:middle line:84%
as well as Metatron,
to help keep

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.132 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual gifts awake.

00:35:52.132 --> 00:35:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is
Archangel Metatron.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:54.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the card.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Right,
and so here, again,

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.760 align:middle line:84%
is a traditional arcana
card, the Chariot,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:03.570 align:middle line:84%
which is about achievement,
public recognition, will power,

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:04.380 align:middle line:90%
self-discipline.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And Metatron is the first
angel of the kabbalah,

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:10.340 align:middle line:84%
because he's about the
beginning of the spiritual path

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:84%
on the tree of
life or sephiroth.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And he's traditionally
the angel to call upon

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:84%
for highly gifted
children, such as what

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.754 align:middle line:84%
we call indigos and
crystal children.

00:36:20.754 --> 00:36:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What about guidance?

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.969 align:middle line:90%
What about focus?

00:36:23.969 --> 00:36:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Metatron's
really good for focus.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.120 align:middle line:90%
He's good with mental powers.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And so he can help
you to visualize.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:36.380 align:middle line:84%
He can help you to do some of
the very high-level spiritual

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.410 align:middle line:84%
gifts, such as remote viewing
or things along those lines.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Interesting.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.004 align:middle line:84%
So that's ways to connect
directly with the divine.

00:36:44.004 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
one of the reasons

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.160 align:middle line:84%
is Metatron was one of two
archangels who was actually

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.510 align:middle line:90%
a human being at one time.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.420 align:middle line:90%
He was the prophet Enoch.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he remembers what
it's like to be a human.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And he knows how to bridge
the divine and the human world

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:58.459 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:36:58.459 --> 00:37:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: One of our
Facebook questions

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.300 align:middle line:84%
coming in here from Michelle
is basically saying,

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:84%
how do I use these
cards in order

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:84%
to set intentions
or ask questions?

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, they work
like any Oracle card deck.

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.814 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can mix them
in with my other decks.

00:37:11.814 --> 00:37:13.230 align:middle line:84%
That's why we made
them this size.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.195 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:37:14.195 --> 00:37:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
people who do not

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:84%
know how to use tarot, like
the Celtic Cross layout,

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.425 align:middle line:90%
are just choosing a card.

00:37:21.425 --> 00:37:22.800 align:middle line:84%
They say, what do
I need to know?

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.640 align:middle line:90%
And pulling one out.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazingly accurate.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.010 align:middle line:84%
This deck just
came out last week,

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's already going
in its third printing.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So can you
set an intention,

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.742 align:middle line:84%
and then you mix the card up
with the intention in mind,

00:37:34.742 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:90%
or the question--

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.453 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and then lay the
cards out and see what comes?

00:37:38.453 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Exactly.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.781 align:middle line:90%
Or you can do it the other way.

00:37:40.781 --> 00:37:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that you want
to manifest abundance.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:84%
You can take the Empress
card and you can put it next

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.610 align:middle line:84%
to your nightstand
or under your pillow.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.977 align:middle line:84%
And it will help you to
create that intention

00:37:49.977 --> 00:37:50.810 align:middle line:90%
the other direction.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.226 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's just
a different form

00:37:52.226 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:90%
of prayer, intention setting.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:54.850 align:middle line:90%
All right, that's great.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.641 align:middle line:84%
So one of the other
cards that we mentioned

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:59.067 align:middle line:84%
that you talked about is
the Archangel Michael.

00:37:59.067 --> 00:37:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yay.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And now
this is the Wheel.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.640 align:middle line:90%
That looked really interesting.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:84%
The wheel, again, is
traditional major arcana

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:84%
from the tarot, which means
it's a time of positive change.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And many of us are going
through huge changes.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Many people tell me they feel
overwhelmed with the energies.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And so Archangel Michael
can make the change less

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:84%
frightening and more grounded
and help you to feel supported

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:84%
as you're-- for instance,
people who are leaving one job

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.344 align:middle line:84%
and going to another, and
they worry about money.

00:38:25.344 --> 00:38:27.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the last thing you want
to do is worry about money.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Because then you'll attract
more things to worry about.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:84%
You want to affirm
abundance, and that's

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:35.896 align:middle line:84%
the time you want to be giving
donations to the charity.

00:38:35.896 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Deb is asking this.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:37.936 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:38:37.936 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:84%
How do you come up
with these phrases

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.870 align:middle line:84%
around the archangels
and the intentions?

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.396 align:middle line:90%
How do you write that?

00:38:44.396 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well,
I mean, I've done

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:84%
a lot of research of spiritual
scripts from every religion.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've been talking
to angels since I

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.980 align:middle line:90%
was as young as I can remember.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I cannot remember a time
when I didn't talk to angels.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.360 align:middle line:90%
So this is lifelong.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when I get a vision
of a book or a card deck,

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing
comes to me at once.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:90%
I see the title, the cover.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I get the essence and the
energy of what it's about.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just a matter of
sitting down at the computer

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:14.970 align:middle line:90%
and typing it out.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I mean, you've
done that 70 times.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.707 align:middle line:90%
You have over 70 books.

00:39:18.707 --> 00:39:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: I don't know how many.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:20.590 align:middle line:90%
That's a guess.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.256 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Amazing.

00:39:21.256 --> 00:39:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I was
hoping one of your--

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Facebook questions--

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.976 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah,
would go to Amazon

00:39:25.976 --> 00:39:27.675 align:middle line:84%
and count it up and
then let us know.

00:39:27.675 --> 00:39:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's amazing.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know that you have
an enormous amount of books

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and people who are such faithful
followers of your information,

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:90%
because you make it practical.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: That's one of the
things that I really find

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:41.890 align:middle line:84%
important is that there's-- I
think it's important to have

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.480 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of spiritual teaching.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But to me what is
important is how does it

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.174 align:middle line:84%
help you to have a
better Monday afternoon?

00:39:48.174 --> 00:39:49.840 align:middle line:84%
How does it help you
be a better parent?

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The highest
suicide day of the week.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Really?

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:52.741 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:39:52.741 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, that's sad.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.113 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is.

00:39:54.113 --> 00:39:55.664 align:middle line:84%
So this is absolutely
a way, a tool,

00:39:55.664 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to-- it doesn't
matter if you're skeptic,

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.710 align:middle line:84%
if you've never heard of
archangels in your life.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.251 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: No.

00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
call them angels even.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The same skills
you can use to talk

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to your Aunt Ruth in heaven
or God or higher self.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.819 align:middle line:84%
It's all the same skills
to tap into the divine.

00:40:11.819 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Can you really do that?

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you use these
types of intentions

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.859 align:middle line:84%
to speak with people who
you've lost, loved ones?

00:40:17.859 --> 00:40:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yeah.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the same four ways
that the angels talk

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.940 align:middle line:84%
to us as Aunt Ruth would or
your dog who passed or Jesus

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.310 align:middle line:90%
or whoever you want to talk to.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You just ask a
question, and then you

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.560 align:middle line:84%
notice what feelings
come into your body,

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:90%
emotional and physical feelings.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And just take a moment with
them and ask your body,

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.000 align:middle line:90%
what are you trying to tell me?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.770 align:middle line:84%
You can write it down,
even, if you want.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to understand it.

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And then if you need
more information,

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
keep asking the questions
until you get enough

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.310 align:middle line:90%
that you feel satisfied with.

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And then if you doubt it,
ask them to give you a sign.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.849 align:middle line:90%
And they will.

00:40:48.849 --> 00:40:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: There is a
specific archangel

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:middle line:84%
for that, for asking

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is the
archangel "Ragwell?"

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Archangel Raguel
is good for relationships.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.430 align:middle line:84%
There's Archangel Chamuel,
who helps with anything

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:90%
that you've lost.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.550 align:middle line:84%
He's analogous to Saint
Anthony in Catholicism.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And each
archangel, as I said,

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.760 align:middle line:90%
has different specifics.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.310 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
know who they are.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.351 align:middle line:84%
You can simply say, God,
please send me an angel.

00:41:13.351 --> 00:41:14.270 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I just think that
it's interesting.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And I feel really close
to all these angels,

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:21.790 align:middle line:84%
because I can see them
and recognize them.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And it just makes you feel
really safe and loved.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this specific one is
about the release, archangel--

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:27.236 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right.

00:41:27.236 --> 00:41:28.460 align:middle line:90%
This is Azrael, who is the--

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Excuse me.

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: He's known
as the angel of death.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Not in a scary way,
but he's the angel

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.595 align:middle line:90%
who helps us to cross over.

00:41:34.595 --> 00:41:36.941 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I just released
that cough, yes.

00:41:36.941 --> 00:41:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And
Azrael also helps us

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to speak to people
who are bereaved.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you have to give
a speech at a funeral

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.600 align:middle line:84%
or you're counseling
someone who's grieving,

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Azrael can help you
to choose those words.

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The Release card in our
Angel Tarot card deck

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:55.110 align:middle line:84%
is really about the
end of something.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:58.010 align:middle line:90%
The door is closing; let it go.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's so true for
so many people right now.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Release the old.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, don't
hang on or try to control.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:06.743 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:42:06.743 --> 00:42:08.750 align:middle line:90%
And to bring in the new.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.220 align:middle line:84%
That's a very-- when
anyone's in that position,

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.700 align:middle line:84%
especially when
you've lost a loved

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.585 align:middle line:84%
one, to be able to
release the pain.

00:42:15.585 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
do it is to feel it.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mm.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:18.665 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:18.665 --> 00:42:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It's authenticity.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.219 align:middle line:90%
The watchword is be authentic.

00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And then what about when
you want to create something

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.920 align:middle line:90%
like balance in your life?

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, well.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The Balance card, of course,
is traditional in Tarot.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And we've got
Archangel Zadkiel, who

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I call the gingko biloba
of the angel world.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Because he's the
angel of good memory.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.450 align:middle line:84%
He helps you to remember
where your car keys are.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.010 align:middle line:84%
He helps you to remember
who you are spiritually.

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:47.140 align:middle line:84%
He helps you to remember
someone's name or phone number.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.720 align:middle line:84%
He's wonderful for students
who are taking a test.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.420 align:middle line:84%
People have told me they put
the Zadkiel card next to them

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.710 align:middle line:84%
when they're taking the
test, and they nail it.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.262 align:middle line:90%
They ace it.

00:42:56.262 --> 00:42:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: They remember things.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: They do, yeah.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And can
you also create--

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.660 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know how to
create something like balance,

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.386 align:middle line:90%
you can ask for help?

00:43:05.386 --> 00:43:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely, yeah.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So when the Balance card comes
up from the Angel Tarot cards,

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.350 align:middle line:84%
it's really about getting a
balance between moderation

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and excess, cooperating,
even sometimes compromising.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And it might mean to take
a pause for perfect timing

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.490 align:middle line:84%
instead of trying to push
or control through something

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.450 align:middle line:90%
faster than it wants to happen.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So these
cards can represent

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:90%
any type of intention setting.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:32.769 align:middle line:84%
If people don't
have the cards, they

00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:34.060 align:middle line:90%
can do this themselves, right?

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.537 align:middle line:90%
You don't need any books.

00:43:35.537 --> 00:43:36.620 align:middle line:90%
You don't need any people.

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't need any cards.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.119 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is already
connected to their angels.

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Really what I think I
do more than anything

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is help people to trust the
messages they already get

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and I help to
validate it and then

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to help people to
get clearer channels

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.010 align:middle line:90%
of divine communication.

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.740 align:middle line:84%
The angels have said that
it's really important for us

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.220 align:middle line:90%
all to be hooked in right now.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the emergency
broadcast system.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Hooked into the
angels or to each other?

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.588 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Hooked into the
angels which is each other.

00:44:04.588 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:90%
We're one in spiritual truth.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:11.660 align:middle line:84%
They want us to really practice
mind-to-mind communication

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.699 align:middle line:84%
with our loved
ones, with angels.

00:44:13.699 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And anyone can do this?

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I've been teaching psychic
development and angel therapy

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.260 align:middle line:84%
courses since 1996
around the world

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to people of every single age
group, from 9 years old to 90

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and in every religious
background, even a couple

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.960 align:middle line:84%
atheists and people who are
on drugs and everything.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do this.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:84%
There's no blocks or barriers
except for someone who has

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.350 align:middle line:84%
decided that they
don't want to or can't.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've known you to show
up at bookstores unannounced

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and go in and start
speaking to people.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.720 align:middle line:90%
And their eyes light up.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.170 align:middle line:84%
They see something,
a communication

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:51.006 align:middle line:84%
that they have maybe
never received before

00:44:51.006 --> 00:44:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and have thought that they
were weird for thinking,

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.430 align:middle line:84%
or shut out, completely
denied and eliminated

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.110 align:middle line:84%
as anything that
exists in their lives.

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And I've been that way, too.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.820 align:middle line:84%
I completely forget
about guidance.

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.600 align:middle line:90%
I think that I'm in charge.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I wake up
and realize I'm not,

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.855 align:middle line:84%
I always say, why
did I forget that?

00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.021 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:45:12.021 --> 00:45:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, well the
bigger someone's purpose,

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:15.810 align:middle line:90%
the louder their ego is.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a one on
one correlation.

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You've got a huge
purpose, so your ego

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:22.280 align:middle line:84%
is working overtime
to make you forget.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.055 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It thinks it knows what
it's doing and has everything

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:26.305 align:middle line:90%
under control, and it doesn't.

00:45:26.305 --> 00:45:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's real seductive.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.736 align:middle line:84%
You know, the ego says, if
do this, you'll be happy.

00:45:28.736 --> 00:45:31.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's always got that future
orientation of happiness.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.477 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self is
happy already right now.

00:45:33.477 --> 00:45:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is absolutely true.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And I create more
in stillness than I

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.400 align:middle line:84%
do with lining up
57 to-do lists.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it's when I'm connected
to source and the divine,

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.150 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:50.179 align:middle line:84%
You are a big water
baby, aren't you?

00:45:50.179 --> 00:45:51.970 align:middle line:84%
You have a love of
affinity with the water.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I have a big
affinity with the water.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.404 align:middle line:90%
I live in Hawaii on the ocean.

00:45:54.404 --> 00:45:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in Southern
California on the ocean,

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm an ocean philanthropist
and environmentalist.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely feel
like we need to take

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.300 align:middle line:90%
care of our ocean system now.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the lungs of
the Earth, and it

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.900 align:middle line:84%
controls the weather
and everything.

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I do a lot of speaking
out about how to help.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
do to help draw attention

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:21.040 align:middle line:84%
to environmentalism is
my girlfriends and I,

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:84%
we actually have mermaid
tails with monofins in them

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.730 align:middle line:90%
that we swim in in the ocean.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.920 align:middle line:84%
We recently had the joy
and pleasure of swimming

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.860 align:middle line:90%
with the ocean artist Wyland.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, what an experience.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It was really fun.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.408 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Look at the pictures.

00:46:33.408 --> 00:46:34.162 align:middle line:90%
That's gorgeous.

00:46:34.162 --> 00:46:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah,
that's me in a tail

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.970 align:middle line:84%
made by my friend Mike
Van Daal of FlipTails

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:39.600 align:middle line:90%
and is a real monofin in there.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.930 align:middle line:84%
You can swim really
fast with this tail.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this is a
photo taken by Wyland?

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: By Wyland himself.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I took a lot of classes of
free diving to do this safely,

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.500 align:middle line:84%
because I'm diving
to-- sometimes

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.164 align:middle line:84%
we go to about 60
feet on one breath,

00:46:54.164 --> 00:46:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want
to do that unless you

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:56.922 align:middle line:90%
know what you're doing.

00:46:56.922 --> 00:46:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh my goodness.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: But it
really connected me

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.670 align:middle line:90%
to memories of Atlantis.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's a video
on YouTube anyone

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.020 align:middle line:84%
can see if they type in
"Wyland" and "mermaids."

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And they can see me
swimming on that.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And actually I'm a scuba
dive master with PADI,

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.757 align:middle line:84%
and I don't scuba dive
hardly ever anymore.

00:47:14.757 --> 00:47:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Because it's--

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Because you
can get to the bottom.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.789 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's so much
more fun to be a mermaid.

00:47:18.789 --> 00:47:21.110 align:middle line:84%
It really evokes
that goddess feeling.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And there's men who do it, too.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who wants to do
it can go on eBay and type

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.850 align:middle line:84%
in "swimmable mermaid tail"
and find an introductory tail

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:29.200 align:middle line:90%
for just a couple hundred bucks.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.300 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's absolutely--

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It is otherworldly.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.674 align:middle line:84%
If I could get angel wings
that fly, I would do that, too.

00:47:35.674 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So instead
you went to the water

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:37.995 align:middle line:90%
with the tail and the fin.

00:47:37.995 --> 00:47:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, exactly.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I've seen
you in that fin,

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.480 align:middle line:90%
and it's absolutely beautiful.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Thank you.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I remember I was sitting
with you in the blue Caribbean.

00:47:44.085 --> 00:47:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: That's right.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.546 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I'll always
remember that image of you.

00:47:46.546 --> 00:47:48.503 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: With your
beautiful mermaid daughter.

00:47:48.503 --> 00:47:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: My mermaid daughter and
with your fin and the blue--

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.030 align:middle line:90%
it's this color.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.992 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
reasons I wore this color.

00:47:53.992 --> 00:47:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Because it reminds me of you.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.670 align:middle line:90%
We actually have a card of the--

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Oh, yes.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Nine of Water.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And in tarot, Nine of Water
means your wishes come true.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the artist depicted--
that's an actual picture of me

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.034 align:middle line:84%
that he painted of me
as a mermaid, which--

00:48:08.034 --> 00:48:09.950 align:middle line:84%
thank you, Steve and
Radleigh, for doing that.

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely beautiful.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of the Facebook
questions coming in from Cora--

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.963 align:middle line:84%
and thank you, by the way, for
connecting with us on Facebook,

00:48:16.963 --> 00:48:19.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of questions coming
in, you have a lot of fans--

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.610 align:middle line:90%
is asking about the iPhone app.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.385 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: How does that work?

00:48:23.385 --> 00:48:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: OK, well, on
the iPhone app store,

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.400 align:middle line:90%
most of my cards are available.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.370 align:middle line:84%
My book "Angel Numbers 101,"
where you type in the numbers

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:33.750 align:middle line:84%
from the angels, it tells
you the meanings-- is an app.

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And my children's book will soon
be an app, "Thank You, Angels."

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.690 align:middle line:84%
They're asking
probably when will

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Angel Tarot Cards be an app.

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And Hay House has told me
that it'll be a little while.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if we see symbols
out there with sequences

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:49.477 align:middle line:84%
of numbers, that
means that the angels

00:48:49.477 --> 00:48:50.560 align:middle line:90%
are communicating with us?

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's one of
the most common ways

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:53.410 align:middle line:84%
that the angels
give us messages.

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Like if you see 444,
it's them saying,

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:57.450 align:middle line:90%
the angels, we're with you.

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:00.306 align:middle line:84%
And 333, the ascended
masters are with you.

00:49:00.306 --> 00:49:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the app tells
you what the numbers mean.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.634 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:49:02.634 --> 00:49:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So you can type in
any three-digit number

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.960 align:middle line:90%
from 0 to 999.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And just type it into this
Angel Numbers 101 app.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And it'll give you the full-on
meaning of what's going on.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.520 align:middle line:90%
It's amazingly accurate.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.395 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How did you come
up with the meaning?

00:49:16.395 --> 00:49:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm a good listener.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of it is
traditional numerology.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.800 align:middle line:84%
In my past life, investigations
of where I've been,

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.370 align:middle line:90%
I was a student of Pythagoras.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And in this life, I'm a
student of Pythagoras, too.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of
the first to say

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.570 align:middle line:84%
this is a mathematically
precise world.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And everything
vibrates numerically.

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.777 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you see things
in geometric shapes?

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yes, I do.

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:45.295 align:middle line:84%
And I often see shapes very
similar to the Gaiam logo.

00:49:45.295 --> 00:49:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And they've told me
that's the building

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.270 align:middle line:90%
blocks of the universe.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to
the platonic solids.

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Plato said that there's only
a certain number of shapes

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.200 align:middle line:84%
that are part of
the whole world.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at things like
the golden ratio of any circles

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.960 align:middle line:84%
in nature, like a tree
trunk or a nautilus

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and the distance
between planets.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's got the same
numbers everywhere.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.080 align:middle line:90%
So it is precise.

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
in divine order,

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:12.370 align:middle line:84%
despite what you
might see on the news.

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
there's things that

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.090 align:middle line:90%
need our attention and help.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.534 align:middle line:90%
And I'm right in the--

00:50:16.534 --> 00:50:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Mix of it all.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I'm right
there working on it.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving money and
time and whatever

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I can do to help and
prayers, of course.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is
that we as light workers

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.530 align:middle line:84%
are here to lift
everyone up, not

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.740 align:middle line:84%
to let this stuff
bring us down, too.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:33.205 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're down,
we're not gonna help anyone.

00:50:33.205 --> 00:50:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well that is the
main point of all of this,

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.675 align:middle line:84%
is to be the light
workers, to lift people up,

00:50:37.675 --> 00:50:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and the people who are light
workers that are-- everyone is.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is that are
watching, giving a resounding,

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.270 align:middle line:90%
yes, that's me.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I found my people.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Essentially, because
this is how we collectively

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.036 align:middle line:90%
give a voice to this.

00:50:50.036 --> 00:50:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Right

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.451 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:50:51.451 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just-- I had
to throw that in.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah, no, thank you.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Your purpose is
enormous to balance

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.940 align:middle line:84%
some of the negativity
going out on the media

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.700 align:middle line:84%
with your beautiful
show and Gaiam TV.

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.034 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So thank you
for doing this, Lisa.

00:51:03.034 --> 00:51:04.575 align:middle line:84%
I hope everyone
continues to tune in.

00:51:04.575 --> 00:51:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is what
Gaiam is up to as well.

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So along with the symbols and
the shapes and the numbers,

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.520 align:middle line:84%
can you tell us what
to look forward to as

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.930 align:middle line:84%
we approach this
2012 time in history

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and the symbolism around
this time in history.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.093 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Well, the way
that we can see the future

00:51:19.093 --> 00:51:21.300 align:middle line:84%
is through the children
coming in right now,

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.860 align:middle line:84%
the children that we call
the crystal, sometimes

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.980 align:middle line:90%
star seeds or rainbow.

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.840 align:middle line:90%
The name isn't important.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But I've spent a lot
of time with teachers

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.450 align:middle line:84%
who've taught in the school
system for 20 or more years,

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.530 align:middle line:84%
talking to them about how
children have changed.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed parents
and the children themselves.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And these new
children coming in,

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.550 align:middle line:84%
they're like little
saints and Buddhas.

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:48.330 align:middle line:84%
They are 100% forgiving, and
they do not hold grudges.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:52.227 align:middle line:84%
The only kind of ego they might
have would be that they-- you

00:51:52.227 --> 00:51:54.060 align:middle line:84%
could say it's law of
attraction or judgment

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.860 align:middle line:84%
if someone's heart
is open or not.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.850 align:middle line:90%
That's all they care about.

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yes, and they are in
the moment, fully present.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.095 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Completely.

00:52:01.095 --> 00:52:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I know your daughter is
definitely a crystal.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And they really resonate
with senior citizens

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:90%
and animals and trees.

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And they
have such compassion.

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And what they really
want is for everyone

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.984 align:middle line:90%
to be at peace and happy.

00:52:11.984 --> 00:52:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's who's going
to grow up and be

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:15.260 align:middle line:90%
the adults of this planet.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So if you don't
have a crystal child

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.780 align:middle line:84%
or if you're not
a crystal child,

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.100 align:middle line:84%
then how do you perpetuate
this type of light worker

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:25.210 align:middle line:84%
or perpetuation of
growth on the planet?

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Literally to
be as crystal child.

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: To be, as an adult--

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: To be like one.

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:28.992 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:52:28.992 --> 00:52:29.700 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: If you look--
my hero, by living hero,

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.150 align:middle line:90%
is His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Why is that?

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I had the opportunity
to get a blessing from him

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:39.490 align:middle line:90%
and meet him.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was like meeting
the most highly evolved

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:45.680 align:middle line:84%
five-year-old boy man
that I've ever met.

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.040 align:middle line:84%
His inner child is so
awakened and alive.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And he's so filled
with happiness,

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.930 align:middle line:84%
despite all the tragedies he
and his country have endured.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And he knows that
that's the key to saving us,

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.470 align:middle line:84%
is that high
vibrational happiness

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:01.722 align:middle line:90%
and that childlikeness.

00:53:01.722 --> 00:53:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: He's constantly
in a state of laughter.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.346 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: He is.

00:53:04.346 --> 00:53:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And bliss.

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.630 align:middle line:90%
And he's very childlike.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
that children teach us

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:15.420 align:middle line:84%
how to enjoy the moment, how to
keep our imagination wide open,

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:20.480 align:middle line:84%
how to play, how to be
silly, how to imagine things,

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.570 align:middle line:90%
to be creative.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:24.051 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you imagine
a world like that?

00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:24.550 align:middle line:90%
I can.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, yes.

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
progressive schools

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.500 align:middle line:84%
that are catching up to
that way of teaching,

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.970 align:middle line:90%
which is wonderful to see.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:32.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of them
here in Colorado.

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
picking up on what

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.830 align:middle line:84%
it means to teach to
those types of children

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and letting go so
much of the testing

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.110 align:middle line:84%
or putting a little bit
less of an emphasis on that.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Although it takes
a journey on that.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: It does, yeah.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It is absolutely.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.450 align:middle line:90%
And it takes a village as well.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the
way that people

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:54.670 align:middle line:84%
can find out about
you, your website.

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:56.065 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah,
angeltherapy.com.

00:53:56.065 --> 00:53:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm touring all the time,
giving angel readings

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:01.847 align:middle line:90%
by audiences in my workshops.

00:54:01.847 --> 00:54:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm on my way to Europe at
the end of this month in May.

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wonderful.

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.121 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: Big tour
there, into Canada

00:54:06.121 --> 00:54:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and on all around the US and
Australia and Japan this year.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:09.819 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, gosh.

00:54:09.819 --> 00:54:11.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
question coming in here

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:14.050 align:middle line:84%
from Gil saying, how
do we thank the angels?

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.129 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:54:15.129 --> 00:54:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: The angels don't
need us to thank them.

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Their reward is if we're happy.

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that's how
we thank the angels.

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.045 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Yeah.

00:54:21.045 --> 00:54:22.630 align:middle line:84%
They said that when
we say thank you,

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:24.710 align:middle line:90%
we're doing it for ourselves.

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Is that the ego again?

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.769 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: It's really--
it's giving gratitude.

00:54:28.769 --> 00:54:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: And gratitude's
the higher self.

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a form of love.

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well, I want you, if you
can, just for the last minute

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.460 align:middle line:84%
that we have remaining
here, you have an intention

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.790 align:middle line:90%
that you'd like to set with us.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VIRTUE: Absolutely.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.840 align:middle line:84%
There's so much light and love
in your powerful audience,

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.780 align:middle line:90%
everyone watching today.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: I would love to
collect it and send it out

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:44.810 align:middle line:90%
to our beautiful planet.

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Great idea, yes.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VIRTUE: So let's
start with our own peace

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.080 align:middle line:84%
by taking in some
deep breaths together.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.985 align:middle line:84%
And on the inhale, just
drawing in the beautiful prana,

00:54:53.985 --> 00:54:57.340 align:middle line:84%
the light and the love
that's in you and around you.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And on each exhale,
letting go of anything

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:08.030 align:middle line:84%
that could be low energy--
fear, worries, stress, anything

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:13.500 align:middle line:84%
that's been bothering you,
just let it go. [EXHALES]

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Your heart is the
gateway, or the portal,

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to home, where you've come
from, where your soul is still

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.040 align:middle line:90%
one with God.

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And let's open that portal
of your heart right now.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.340 align:middle line:90%
It's safe for you to love.

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It's safe for you
to open your heart.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It's safe for you to feel.

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:31.710 align:middle line:90%
The angels are protecting you.

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And let us together
unite this light

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and love coming
through our heart,

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.920 align:middle line:84%
sending it out to our
loved ones, to each other,

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.290 align:middle line:84%
deep into the core
of our Mother Earth,

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and blanketing this
beautiful planet,

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the world as
it truly is spiritually,

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:51.062 align:middle line:90%
like we all are, healed.

00:55:51.062 --> 00:55:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Namaste and peace to you, to
our planet, and to everyone.

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.860 align:middle line:90%

beautifully appropriate
