>>LISA GARR: Have you ever
traveled to a new place

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and immediately tapped
into its unique energy?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Or have you ever met
someone for the first time

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.314 align:middle line:90%
and felt an instant connection?

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:84%
These are the types of
experiences that my guest has

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:90%
had her entire life.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And instead of being afraid
and hiding these gifts,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
for the past 30
years Sonja Grace

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
has written and spoken
about her experiences

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and shared them with the world.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Lisa Garr.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:90%
And joining me is Sonja Grace.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
She's the author of
"Spirit Traveler,"

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
"Become an Earth Angel,"
and her latest book,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:90%
"Dancing with Raven and Bear."

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:10%
Sonja considers herself an
energy surgeon whose spirit

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:10%
travels to work with people
doing energy clearings

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.290 align:middle line:10%
and long-distance healings.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, my friend.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SONJA GRACE:
Thank you so much.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So great
to have you here.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I know, I'm
thrilled to be here with you.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Me too.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So tell me a little bit
about your past growing up?

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It was an eclectic background
that you have here.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yeah, I
was born in Oregon

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:10%
and I was raised on a farm.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.610 align:middle line:10%
And my experience of
seeing, hearing, smelling,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:10%
and feeling the spirit
realm has always been.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:90%
I was born that way.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But my earliest memory
was at two years old.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:10%
And my mom used
to tell the story

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:10%
that I would roll the
crib across the room

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:10%
and hit the door so she
would come and get me.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about
it and I went,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:84%
how is that possible that
I could roll the crib?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Those cribs are really heavy.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And my memory is looking
up and seeing my guides

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
on both sides of the crib
rolling it across the floor.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You remember
this at two?

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I remember
distinctly seeing them.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The freakier thing is
your mom walking in the door

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and the crib's across the room.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.776 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't imagine as
a parent seeing that.

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
You put your baby
to bed over here,

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and now the child is over here.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:90%
What did she say later?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: My mom,
she really had a lot

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:10%
to deal with me because
I was so out there.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:10%
I saw the spirit realm.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:10%
And she would be
really nice about it

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:10%
and say, oh, honey,
that's a nice story or,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:10%
why don't you go to
the woods and play?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:10%
And I literally grew
up in the woods.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I played, I saw the Devic
Realm, I saw all the spirits

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:90%
of the trees and the plants.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:90%
It was my home.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And my mom eventually
corralled me into,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, she's very artistic,
let's put her in ballet class.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So I trained as a
classical ballerina.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Did you have siblings?

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, I have
three older sisters.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And did they see
these types of beings?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I think they're all
sensitive in their own way.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:10%
But I seemingly am
the one in the family

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.365 align:middle line:10%
who got the full package deal.

00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well at
least your mother

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
knew enough to
enhance those and not

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.224 align:middle line:84%
put you into traditional
school or something that

00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
would put you into
a box because I

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:90%
don't think it would have fit.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: No, not at all.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:10%
And really studying
ballet taught me

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:10%
all the skills that I have
learned to defy time and space

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:10%
and to spirit travel.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think
about it, how many turns

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:90%
can you do in a count of eight?

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It totally changes
your whole perception.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
You know this as
a dancer yourself.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
It changes your perception
of time and space

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.045 align:middle line:84%
because you've got eight counts,
and how many turns can you get?

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: And you have to
move across the floor

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:10%
and it's like you're floating.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yes, and I remember
being on stage and ready to go

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:10%
and seeing spirits that
were there in that theater,

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:10%
standing in the
middle of a stage.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm ready to go
going, get out of the way.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So this was accepted
for you your whole life,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
and you never were afraid
of it, which is amazing.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
How did you learn then
to use the energies

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to heal and to have your
own healing abilities?

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Well that was a
hard chapter because I really

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:10%
struggled with it as a
teenager and as a young adult.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:10%
I didn't understand it.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:10%
I really didn't have
anyone to guide me

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:10%
until I found my first teacher.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And she is really the person who
saved my life on many levels,

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and helped me not only learn
how to work as a healer,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and I studied for a long
time as a hands-on healer.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:10%
And then she also
gave me that platform

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:10%
of how to work with integrity
and truth and clarity and all

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:10%
the things that one
needs to be in service.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you absorb
other people's energies

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:84%
when you were not aware of
these gifts and talents.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:90%
so much in high school?

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Was it hard for you
to have relationships?

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:90%
Did you take everything on?

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It was very hard.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm only asking
because if people

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:90%
have the same experience.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, of course.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:10%
It was very hard,
and I isolated a lot

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:10%
because I was trying
to deal with the fact

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:10%
that there were 10 people
in the spirit realm standing

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:10%
there talking to me.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:90%
I was like, why are you here?

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I would see
colors, massive colors,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:84%
in peoples auric fields
when I'd walk around.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.420 align:middle line:90%
It was like, oh my god.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'd ask my friends,
did you see that?

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
That person had orange
all over their face.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And my friends would go, no.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.405 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So probably
hard to keep friends?

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yeah, I was just
I was wide open, wide open.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:10%
And I tell you, thank
god for theater and dance

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:10%
because that truly
channeled all of that energy

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:10%
and what I was going through
and taught me to ground.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:10%
If one thing you learn
when you're a dancer,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:10%
it's how to ground your energy.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So then you found
a person, a mentor,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that could really help
you focus and channel all

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:90%
that you were experiencing.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:10%
At what point did you realize
that you could actually travel?

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:90%
What is spirit traveling?

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: OK, so two parts.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The teacher that I had,
she is an amazing healer.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And she's someone who really
helped me define and understand

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:90%
my gifts.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only person
that's ever sat with her

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and has been able to see her
guides and all of the things

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:90%
that she was able.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:10%
So she really took
me under her wing

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:10%
and helped me create
who I am really today,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:10%
I owe her a lot of credit.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And the second part is in
order to spirit travel,

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:84%
this has been a process of
me meditating for 36 years.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
This is me really
being dedicated

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to my process of meditation.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And out of that I started
to experience dissolving.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
My whole body, it
dissolves and it's gone.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's not until that
moment that my guides then

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.320 align:middle line:84%
come in and take
my hand, and we go.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But I don't go anywhere
without my guides.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And my guides are
high-angelic beings.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:90%
So I don't travel anywhere.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not astral projecting,
I am literally going,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.400 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going back in time.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How does your body
get taken care of at the time?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:84%
How do you keep it
grounded and tethered?

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well I have a grounding
meditation that I teach

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
basis of my work.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.007 align:middle line:84%
And so I always do my
grounding meditation first.

00:08:05.007 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So that is
really interesting.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:90%
You say that you dissolve.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you're really
letting Sonja-person go,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and the ego and
the personalities,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:90%
so that you can surrender.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And you go on
journeys in the past?

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, I actually
am traveling through time.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I spirit travel to
a place, I am back in time.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I've gone back 250,000 years.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:84%
I have gone way,
way back in time.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And I do not go
without my guides.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
This is totally
directed by my guides.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I wrote the
book, "Spirit Traveler,"

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
my guides came to
me and said, we

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.900 align:middle line:84%
want to take you somewhere
and show you this place.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And I ended up at Stonehenge.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was their direction,
it was not me saying,

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.379 align:middle line:84%
oh, can you please take
me to blah, blah, blah.

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you
say you've gone back

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:90%
250,000 years, how do you know?

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Right?

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.046 align:middle line:84%
Is there guy standing
there with a big clock?

00:09:13.046 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Or a book
that says, this

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is what happened
250,000 years ago.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:90%
You're like, that's where I was.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, my guides
tell me where we are

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and what the time period is.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And what did you see?

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, the whole
landscape is different.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And everything has a
different look to it.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Where it was once desert
it's green and lush.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about a time period

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:84%
where giants really
did walk the earth.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of that perception
of seeing that particular time

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:90%
is intimidating.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I remember standing
with my guides

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and hiding because
I was so intimidated

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:90%
by what I was seeing.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the foliage
was larger, the beings.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.564 align:middle line:84%
Was this around dinosaurs
or way before that?

00:10:10.564 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, before.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Before that.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was lush and full of
foliage, and you felt small?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Very.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Very small, and scared.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In a totally
unfamiliar land.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And did you ever go to other
planets, not just this one?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, many times.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been to Pleiades and
Orion and a few other places.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
The most amazing
thing that I feel

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
has come to me as a spirit
traveler is that humans

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:90%
were brought to earth.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.119 align:middle line:10%
They came to Earth
20 million years ago.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Brought to Earth?

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, they
came in a ship.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So somebody flew the ship,
they were brought in.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:10%
Humans are as much
extraterrestrial

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:10%
as extraterrestrials.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:10%
So our physical forms, which
have changed over time,

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:10%
the original model of
humans came to Earth

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:10%
20 million years ago.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And what I was told
is that we came

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
from a planet that is in name
the mathematical equation of 0.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
0 is the only number
that is not in duality.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And why that's so important is
we live in a dualistic reality.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the process
right now of experiencing

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:90%
duality splitting apart.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to live
in a non-dualistic reality

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:90%
here within 100 years.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.985 align:middle line:84%
And so the human form is finally
returning back to that state.

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
I was going to ask,

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%
is it going back to
its original state?

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What made you
decide or think that humans

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:90%
were brought to the Earth?

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Was this a vision that you had?

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, this was
actually a spirit travel

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:90%
that I did to Egypt.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:10%
And it was from that
travel that I was then

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:10%
shown the original
humans that came through.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So do you physically
go to these locations

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
or are you traveling
in your meditations?

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I am dissolving
and my soul body

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.087 align:middle line:90%
is going to these places.

00:12:36.087 --> 00:12:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How long are
you in the meditations?

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: And I'm really
out of it when I come back.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.893 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You must be.

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Really,
disoriented big time.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what I
was asking, how long?

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Are you there for hours?

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Sometimes I think
I'm only there 20 minutes

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.687 align:middle line:90%
and it's been four hours.

00:12:52.687 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: My goodness.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And in those experiences
you come back

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:90%
with really clear communication.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:90%
You remember it all?

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, I do.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:90%
It's full-on conversations.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:90%
It's been really fun.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote "Spirit Traveler,"
I write about the actual,

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
this is what we know, this
is what history has taught us

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:19.214 align:middle line:84%
about Stonehenge or about
Tiwanaku or Chichen Itza,

00:13:19.214 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
wherever I've written
about in the book.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I give
my spirit travels

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:90%
and what happened to me.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And that I could feel the rain
on my face, and that I did

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:90%
wear a coat before I left.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:10%
And that I stood
on Skellig Michael,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.890 align:middle line:10%
and there was rain
hitting me from all sides.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And this long line of monks
took me into the beehive huts.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's incredible,
that's why I wrote the book.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That is very
detailed, extremely detailed,

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.130 align:middle line:90%
as if you were there.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you go back
to these locations

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and look and see what it is
that you saw in your visions

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:90%
to be true?

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I do.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
In particular with Stonehenge,
I went to Stonehenge

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and had basically
everything that I

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:84%
received in information
about the place then

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%
was an experience.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:10%
That was like, oh, yeah, this
is exactly what I experienced

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:10%
when I spirit traveled.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you go and
experience other history

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:90%
when you get there, as well?

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.967 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, I do.

00:14:19.967 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: All right, we're
going to take a look here

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
at Sonja in a location and
see what she experiences

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.696 align:middle line:84%
and how she goes
through the area.

00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: This site is
called Glenelg Brochs.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:84%
This fort it was built
over 2,000 years ago.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Think of how the people
might have lived back then.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:10%
It's circular, it had different
levels, different floors to it.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:10%
The stonework itself
is incredible.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:10%
But this place also
held an energy.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:10%
It's circular.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:10%
Many things in the world
are circular, especially

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:10%
in history.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:10%
We have the ancient kivas
that Native Americans

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:10%
used for ceremonial purposes.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:10%
We have mounds that are all over
the United Kingdom and Scotland

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:10%
and Ireland.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.990 align:middle line:10%
There is all kinds
of circular things

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:10%
that were built
that hold energy.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:10%
The energy would come
up through the earth,

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:10%
not only inside this fort
but in this whole valley.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:10%
This land is rich with an
energy that's very ancient

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:10%
and has to do with the
fairies and the sprites

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:10%
and all of that natural
energy that the earth holds.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:10%
You can still feel it
today but it's much less

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:10%
than it was back then.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:10%
Many of these places are
aligned with the astronomy.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:10%
The sun and the moon and the
way that the stars are moving,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:10%
everything lines up.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.555 align:middle line:10%
They didn't watch television,
they watched the sky.

00:15:52.555 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What you must
absorb from those locations

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
is completely different than
what's in the history books,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.944 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, very much.

00:16:04.944 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: How do you
deal with that?

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
What's being taught
about the location

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:84%
is completely different
than what you know.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well in the case
of Saint Winifred's Well,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
really good example.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:84%
If you grow up Catholic
and you understand

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
the stories of the saints,
it's very different.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:10%
When I went to the well,
I saw Saint Winifred

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:10%
standing in front of me.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:10%
And she said, I want to show
you what really happened back

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:10%
in my time.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very sacred place.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:90%
The water, it's so beautiful.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And the story goes
in Catholicism

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:84%
that she was standing on
the steps of the church,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and the man that she jilted
and said she wouldn't marry

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
rode by on a horse and
lopped her head off.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And her uncle, the
priest, came running out

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and magically sewed
her head back on.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:90%
Poof!

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
And she became a saint
and she healed people,

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:90%
and that's the story.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Well the real story
is she was in love

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.329 align:middle line:84%
with a man in the
village who was a pagan.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was completely forbidden
because her family was

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.140 align:middle line:84%
in the church, and she
was destined to be a nun.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And they took his
head and put it

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:84%
on a stake to show
the people, this

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is what happens if
you are a pagan.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And she was taken
into the church.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, of course.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And with no ill feelings
towards Catholicism,

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
but stories do get shifted
because they become teaching

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
tools for the religion
or the politicians

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:90%
or whoever is in charge.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you see any evidence
of a stake or anything that

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:84%
would have made sense to that
story when you were there?

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well when she
showed me what happened

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:90%
I saw the whole thing happen.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:10%
We were back in time, she
took me into the village,

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.249 align:middle line:10%
I saw the men grab the guy.

00:18:10.249 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that happened to me

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:90%
that was really spectacular.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's the
last "Star Wars" movie,

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
but Luke Skywalker is
on Skellig Michael.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know this.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching the
movie with my husband,

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden I
see the beehive huts

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going, that's
Skellig Michael.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm yelling in the theater.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:84%
People are turning
around looking at me.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was spectacular because
all the places that they went,

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
it was like, yes,
that's where I was.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:90%
That's where I went.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.389 align:middle line:84%
It was such a great
moment for me.

00:18:51.389 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Well let's
take a look at you

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:84%
actually in the
physical locations.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: This particular
site is Croft Moraig,

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's outside of
Perth in Scotland.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:84%
It is a really obscure but
magnificent stone circle

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:90%
on a farm.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And we went there
and did some filming.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very weird feeling.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
All of these stone
circles or portals.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And this particular place,
although it's still a portal,

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of history where
people had fought and died.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole vibe of that
stone circle had been askewed.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:37.090 align:middle line:90%
And it had some very odd vibes.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So it still
has that energy in it.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Did you spirit travel to the
location before you got there?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, I did.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot of ghosts
around the stone circle.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So we were dealing with a
lot of different energies

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:90%
while we were there.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was disruptive,
whereas I've

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:84%
been in other stone
circles where the energy is

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:90%
much cleaner and clearer.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What was
it historically?

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Did it match what
you experienced?

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, it did.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:10%
OK, historically, there's
at least 1,000 stone circles

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:10%
in the UK.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:10%
And these different
stone circles

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:10%
have been placed,
in my understanding,

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:10%
to mark the portal of which
energy is either coming through

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:10%
from above or it's coming
from the Earth, going out.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Or like Stonehenge, it's both.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And so this particular stone
circle had energy going out.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:90%
So we all felt it.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like
felt like we kept

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:84%
dispersing in all
these directions

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:90%
while we were in the circle.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:90%
It was very odd.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Do you know how those
massive stones got there?

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well the
ancient ones showed me

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:84%
all of the different layers
of things that happened.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first
went to Stonehenge,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing
on Salisbury Plain.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It was totally empty.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:10%
And so the people
back in 8,000 BC

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:10%
marked these portals with
branches and garlands

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:10%
and small stones.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And then of course the wooden
henge was built through time.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And then around 4,000 BC the
sarsen stones were placed.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient ones showed me
how they literally levitated

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:90%
these stones into place.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Seriously, they are massive.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle line:10%
So it only makes
sense that there

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.466 align:middle line:10%
was some other technology that
was used to place these stones.

00:21:42.466 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's
the great mystery.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: That's what I saw.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In your spirit travels?

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Got it.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And Stonehenge has
burial mounds around it.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of archaeologists
and historians

00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:00.430 align:middle line:84%
believe oh, this must have
been a death ritual place.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
That's not what happened at all.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.610 align:middle line:90%
This was a place for fertility.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:10%
This is where, I call
them the ancient ones--

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:10%
they're Pleiadians,
but they're demigods--

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:10%
they would come through and
teach the high priestesses

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:10%
the ceremonies.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And this Stonehenge
was used for fertility.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:10%
So all of the high
priestesses would basically

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:10%
cross-pollinate
with the star beings

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:10%
and bring forth a
new race of beings.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's happened
all over the earth.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, the demigods who
we can look to as aliens,

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:84%
but they're much
more benevolent.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:84%
They're much bigger,
they're 12, 15 feet tall.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:10%
>>LISA: Now when
you go there and you

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.160 align:middle line:10%
experience all of this
story, history is a story.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a story.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And the story is based on who's
in charge, who's in power,

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and what religion is
the focus of the people.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean look at history
and how many rulers

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:90%
have been completely wiped out.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows that they ruled
because the next person didn't

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:90%
want them known.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We've seen that time
and time again in history.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:84%
We now are seeing so
many things exposed.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic Church has
been exposed in many ways.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And banking systems are exposed.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And there's so many things.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:90%
The truth is finally coming out.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that is?

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Because we're now
in the fifth dimension.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We have moved from
the fourth dimension

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
When the Mayan calendar
ended it didn't

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
mean the world was
ending, it meant

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:84%
we're making a
dimensional change.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And in this higher frequency
of the fifth dimension

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:84%
we have moved literally
into the throat chakra.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
This is all about
us communicating,

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
being more telepathic
with each other,

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:90%
and expressing who we are.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm serious when
I say if you could

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:84%
give a microphone to every
person on the planet,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:90%
they've got something to say.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I hear it all day
long with my clients.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a public
speaker, I want

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:90%
to be able to tell my story.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's powerful, because
people have something to say.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
this energy we're in.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
It's really exposing the truth.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm so glad you
said that because I'd

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
like to take what you're talking
about in these experiences

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to a
grounded reality,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:90%
and how people can use it today.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.012 align:middle line:84%
And you're a very
grounded person.

00:24:44.012 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're in the
world, and you're

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.844 align:middle line:84%
working, and your healing,
and you're working with people

00:24:47.844 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:84%
How does it apply to
practical everyday life

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:84%
when you bring about
this information

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:90%
and in these travels?

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well when I
work with my clients,

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:84%
which is over the phone because
I do all long-distance work,

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly helping people
understand that we cannot

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
expect this fifth dimension
energy to meet us,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:90%
we have to meet it.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It is really up to
us to do the work.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to go
inside and excavate

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.580 align:middle line:84%
all the emotional
wounds and understand

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that those emotional wounds
are the karmic threads

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:90%
to our past lives.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that if we heal
in this lifetime,

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:84%
we will start to heal
in past lifetimes.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And we will be able
to make that jump of,

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.700 align:middle line:84%
why do I feel abandoned and
why does everybody leave me?

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And then understand that
in the last 10 lifetimes

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
they've been left or
abandoned, or the tribe

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:84%
picked up and moved and
they were left behind.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to start
connecting history

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:90%
because we're working in cycles.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:90%
We are cycling all the time.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how does
talking about the past

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and the karmic threads and
everything help humanity

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.700 align:middle line:90%
going forward?

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Because
humanity as a soul group,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
we have collective
karma together.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
We have karma in fear,
we have karma in shock,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:84%
we have karma in
abandonment and betrayal.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
All of us as people share
the collective karma.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And in that we have
cycles, and these cycles

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:90%
go round and round.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at history, this
happened, then this happened,

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:90%
then this happened.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And here we are again.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
This is happening, then
this is going to happen,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and then this is
going to happen.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:44.330 align:middle line:10%
And it is up to us to really
do the work on the inner

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.237 align:middle line:10%
so that we can
change that cycle.

00:26:47.237 --> 00:26:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: What is the cycle?

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Where are we heading?

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well we are coming to
the end of a phase of humanity.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So the long story of
this is most of us

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
came through during
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And we said, yes, I want
to be here on Earth,

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be a part
of the human experience.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So we've had hundreds
of lifetimes.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:10%
And now we're coming to the
end of this phase of humanity,

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:10%
which is why people
want answers,

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:10%
people want to know who
they are spiritually.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: The stakes are higher.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: The stakes are higher.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:10%
And our children,
our grandchildren,

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:31.010 align:middle line:10%
our great grandchildren are the
ones who will carry the torch

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:10%
and move into the next
phase of humanity.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:10%
So that is all getting
passed on to them.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And the cycle that we're
in is all of these feelings

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:90%
that I just talked about.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We just went through shock,
we've moved into fear,

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
come around the bend

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.720 align:middle line:90%
to some kind of betrayal.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.190 align:middle line:84%
As a collective, we're
working through the emotions

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:02.030 align:middle line:84%
because our emotions are
the very thing that we

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:90%
have in common.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:90%
You feel love, I feel love.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: True, they are.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Now you said the
end of humanity.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't mean that the
human race is going to die.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to be transformed?

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It's the end
of a phase of humanity.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.890 align:middle line:90%
So we're transforming again.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the
children, the babies

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that are being born now,
they are the ones that

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
will take the torch and
start a new face of humanity,

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:90%
just like we did.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Just like we
did when we were little?

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But the youth of today,
like the Parkland kids

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and that type of
generation, they're

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:90%
moving into the truth phase?

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Is that the next phase?

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well we're
in truth because we're

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
in this fifth
dimension, but we're

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.780 align:middle line:84%
going through these
karmic emotional pieces.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we're going
through these phases

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:90%
and then we hit betrayal.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.065 align:middle line:84%
Are we in that phase
right now of betrayal?

00:28:55.065 --> 00:28:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.670 align:middle line:84%
We recently went through
fear and then shock

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.350 align:middle line:90%
and now betrayal.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And betrayal for us as a
species is things more related

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.660 align:middle line:90%
to duality splitting apart.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.295 align:middle line:84%
So we have governments failing,
we have things being exposed.

00:29:15.295 --> 00:29:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're in
that fifth dimension

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:90%
so things are getting uncovered.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Systems failing.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Systems failing and
hacking and unbelievable things

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:84%
happening to our own
computers, let alone computers

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.110 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is all a part
of that betrayal.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I would think
we're still in shock.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But yes, the financial
system has become exposed.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:84%
There's the health
care system exposed,

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:84%
there's the political
system exposed.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
schools pretty soon.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there's a lot.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.197 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: There is.

00:29:53.197 --> 00:29:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But it's
getting to the truth?

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, and we're cycling,
literally, these feelings.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're
born we're handed

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:90%
a palette like a painter.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And we have all of
our emotions on it.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And every day, we're like, oh,
I think I'll paint some joy

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and now I think I'll paint
some sadness and maybe

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.920 align:middle line:90%
a little betrayal.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we're painting our world
with this emotional palette.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And as a whole species,
we share a palette.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And the feelings that we're
working through right now

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
are the karmic piece,
or the collective karma,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.290 align:middle line:84%
that we as a species
are tackling.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Well or not well, it's up to us.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So as a species, we're
going through this together.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.170 align:middle line:84%
How we manage it is
through our emotions.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And we can choose
to have and paint

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:84%
an emotion of action that day,
or an emotion of joy that day,

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:84%
or an emotion of love, or
an emotion of whatever it

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:90%
is that moves it forward.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And then where are
we going after this?

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I vote the love paint.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So after betrayal
we're going to move

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:07.700 align:middle line:90%
into a feeling of resentment.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
through resentment.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
come out of resentment

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and go into this new more of an
awakening, like an aha moment.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.530 align:middle line:10%
The collective
consciousness, everybody

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:10%
goes, oh, I didn't look
at it from that direction.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to hit
that resentment first.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So hit resentment after
betrayal, which makes sense,

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:90%
and then go into an awareness.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's an aha moment.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: A heightened awareness?

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That is very important.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:90%
That I would love.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.970 align:middle line:84%
A consciously
aware, awake world.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll take it.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Me too.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So what's next is we
are going to evolve.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth is going
to change, she's

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:84%
going to have all kinds of
disruption, as she always has.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
evolve as a species.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to watch
duality split apart.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Some people will make
this kind of decision,

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
some people will make
this kind of decision.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.248 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So we'll
be more polarized?

00:32:12.248 --> 00:32:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we will
have a breakthrough

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:84%
where, like I said, the younger
generations will get to ride

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:90%
that wave of the golden era.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's our job to help them
to usher them into that place.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's why a show
like this is so important.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why talking about
inspirations as something that

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.830 align:middle line:84%
improves the
quality of your life

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and really moves humanity
forward is so important.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
the same thing?

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, every day.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:10%
I work with clients
all day long,

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and I see people struggling,
feeling hopelessness,

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.745 align:middle line:10%
feeling like they're not
going to get through.

00:32:52.745 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I help them reignite
what their purpose is,

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.440 align:middle line:84%
why they need to be
there for their children

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and their grandchildren, why
it's so important that we have

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:84%
clean water, and
we have clean air,

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and we have soil that we
can plant healthy food in.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So how do you help with
that level of hopelessness?

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: I do a lot of
processing work with them.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:10%
I work with the inner child.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.010 align:middle line:10%
I help them by excavating
emotional wounds,

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.490 align:middle line:10%
finding where the
betrayal is in their body

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:10%
and lifting that out.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.390 align:middle line:10%
Working on them physically.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:10%
Say there's a liver problem, I
go in and restructure the liver

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:39.260 align:middle line:10%
and repair tissue.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Can you do
that with humanity?

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.390 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you think?

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:84%
How can we create that
same level of healing

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:90%
with our planet, with humanity?

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I love your mind.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I'm going big, girl.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Go big or go home.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well I
think that the way

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:07.460 align:middle line:84%
to do that is to first of
all, in what I teach, teach

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.550 align:middle line:84%
people how to meditate
and how to ground.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And people think of
meditation, and a lot of times

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.159 align:middle line:84%
they go right into their
third eye and think,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah, that's where--

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
I teach a completely
different form of meditation

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:24.889 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a firm believer
that why we're here on Earth

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
is to ground our
energy into the Earth.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
That the Earth is here
to give us energy.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And if we're spending all of
our time sending our energy out

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.300 align:middle line:84%
into other things,
that's actually

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:84%
how we're creating more
karma for ourselves.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.169 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: By putting
our energy out?

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're
watching TV, and there's

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.650 align:middle line:90%
some disaster that happened.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
just horrible,

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.345 align:middle line:84%
and your energy from your third
or maybe even your second--

00:34:53.345 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of empaths will
understand what I'm saying--

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.500 align:middle line:84%
will go out to the television
and go into the whole thing.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you want
to support that.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the
way to support it

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:84%
because now you're hooking up
with those people, their fear,

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.390 align:middle line:84%
their anxiety, their
betrayal, everything,

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and you're creating more karma.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.890 align:middle line:84%
You're becoming a part
of the collective karma.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Where the energy should
go is into the ground.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And I teach a meditation that's
in "Become an Earth Angel"

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that is cones of energy
that send that energy down

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.360 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So you're receiving
energy from the Earth,

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.590 align:middle line:90%
you're sending energy down.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:90%
But you're not sending it out.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Now from here if you want to
send love energy out, of course

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:90%
you should.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.562 align:middle line:84%
We're here to love at the
deepest level of our being.

00:35:45.562 --> 00:35:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the energy
you're sending down

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.454 align:middle line:90%
is the negativity and the fear.

00:35:49.454 --> 00:35:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, it's
all your energy.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
It is your energy
connecting to the Earth.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So when you
watch that type of media,

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and you see it everywhere,
you can't avoid it,

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.150 align:middle line:90%
it's in the aethers.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:10%
You basically just
ground your own body?

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, you
ground your energy.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And receive, then,
energy from the Earth,

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:90%
who will constantly give.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Absolutely,
she's so there for us.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think of the
support she gives us daily.

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: She tries.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we can then
mix that with love?

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%
And send that out to humanity.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:28.495 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we start to
change the global conversation?

00:36:28.495 --> 00:36:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, exactly, because
love will supersede everything.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Even in the darkest moments,
love will supersede everything.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most important
thing everyone can remember.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're in
a really dark place

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and you can't think of
anything, think of the love

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that you have for your
child or for your dog

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.820 align:middle line:90%
or for your partner.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:84%
That love is what keeps
us really evolving.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: When you are
working with people

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and if they have an
illness, is that what you do

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:84%
is you go into
that place of love

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
to expand or to break
up that illness?

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I always work
in a state of love,

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.810 align:middle line:84%
but I'm actually
more like a surgeon.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going in and
literally putting in a stent

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and doing what is the
equivalency of a triple bypass.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm literally using my hands
and working like a surgeon.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Like a
psychic surgeon so

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to speak, without the blood

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, no
gauze, no blood.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.770 align:middle line:84%

a specific location that
you remember that you

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:90%

come up here and so forth.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

This one's a beautiful
beaming of love.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:84%

I was in prayer at one of
my meditation retreats,

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:10%
and my assistant
took that photograph.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing because
the whole group saw it.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I was holding tobacco in
my hand and I was praying.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And that beam of
light just came down

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:90%
and went right into my hand.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:84%
It makes me tear up
to even talk about it.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.110 align:middle line:90%
It was really amazing.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It's right outside of

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's on a hill, and
it's just spectacular.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.760 align:middle line:90%
It's very steep and it's long.

>>GRACE: I did not.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.810 align:middle line:84%
We actually went there because
I wanted to really connect

with that energy.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Certainly St. Michael
and all of the angels,

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.449 align:middle line:84%
I felt the angels
there big time.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And I see angels all the time so
it's not like it was like, wow,

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:27.340 align:middle line:90%
there's angels.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But I felt their
presence at this site

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
because mostly what I
was feeling at the site

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:84%
was some of the
hardship and things

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that people had gone
through in history.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.960 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
fighting and war

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and things that
happened in the UK.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Absolutely.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this journey for you was
touching and feeling the walls

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing that
energy of the archangels.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a great way to travel.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to go
and experience something.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.749 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just looking
and reading the plaques

00:39:57.749 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
on the walls, feel
what's happening there

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and intuit it in your own sense
what may be happening there.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I felt a lot of
things at the tor.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I felt a lot of the history,
the fighting, the things that

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:84%
went on there, but also
the beauty of that site.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: This is funny, because
I see you touching the bricks

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.420 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the photos, and I've
always been the type of person

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.650 align:middle line:90%
that does that, too.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I love going to historic
areas and touching the bricks

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.560 align:middle line:90%
because they have seen so much.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And if they could talk,
they could tell the truth.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you experience?

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I do.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I pick up a lot of energy
when I touch the stones

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:90%
or wherever I am.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:10%
Some places it's been, OK.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a good
thing for someone to try.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:54.857 align:middle line:84%
If they want to go and
experience the energy.

00:40:54.857 --> 00:40:57.190 align:middle line:10%
You would think a brick wall
wouldn't give you anything,

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.670 align:middle line:10%
a stone wall, but it does.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Oh, let me
tell you, some of those

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.590 align:middle line:90%
castles in England.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:90%
There's so much history.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
touch the wall to feel it,

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:84%
but you feel it just
walking through for sure.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Let's take a look
here at Sonja talking about

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:18.490 align:middle line:90%
her book, "Spirit Traveler."

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Spirit
traveling through the ages,

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Sonja Grace answers
the questions

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that have mystified
historians for centuries.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And we're experiencing
something that is not exactly

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.274 align:middle line:90%
the way history recorded it.

00:41:33.274 --> 00:41:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: She
receives the truth

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.570 align:middle line:84%
of why these ancient
sites were built.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.990 align:middle line:84%
With all that she learns,
Sonja travels in real time

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.360 align:middle line:84%
to each one of
these famous sites.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Using her unique talents,
she listens to the stones,

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:84%
tunes into the
energies, and validates

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.585 align:middle line:84%
the truths she learned
in her spirit travels.

00:41:52.585 --> 00:41:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And the ancient
ones would take them

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:59.100 align:middle line:84%
into the center of this space
that's now called the Cove,

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and they would assess what
their healing problems were.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.290 align:middle line:84%
They would assess
what they needed.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:84%
These stones were placed
by the ancient ones.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.370 align:middle line:84%
They have the essence of the
ancient ones inside of them.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was their last
statement to the people,

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.010 align:middle line:84%
we will always be with
you, but we're not

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.860 align:middle line:90%
coming back for a long time.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: The world is
full of mysterious places.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:84%
From the monoliths of
Great Britain and Ireland

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient
Egyptian pyramids,

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:32.710 align:middle line:84%
from Bolivia's strange
Tiwanaku The Gate of the Sun

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to the temple of
Chichen Itza, there

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.390 align:middle line:90%
is so many questions unanswered.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Sonja Grace unlocks ancient
mysteries and secrets

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:84%
of the world's greatest
historic sites.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you travel
in your meditations,

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:52.420 align:middle line:84%
you travel physically to these
locations, you do it all.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Your life as a spirit
traveler, what a unique life.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.690 align:middle line:90%
What an amazing life.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:58.880 align:middle line:90%
And you embrace it all.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you not pick up
these energies, though,

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.340 align:middle line:90%
and take them with you?

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you're
in a location and being

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:90%
or a guide sticks to you.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever have a hard
time shaking that off?

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But OK, again, a
gift that I have

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to clear
things from people.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Entities, aliens,
implants, demons.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've done complete
exorcisms of people.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that this is a gift
because I've never really met

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.100 align:middle line:84%
anybody who can do it on the
level that I'm able to see.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm able to see all
levels of the astral plane

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:47.157 align:middle line:10%
from angels down to the lowest
entity demon kind of things.

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And you're
not afraid of them?

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.906 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: And I'm not afraid.

00:43:49.906 --> 00:43:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I am able to clear
these things out.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So when I go to places, if
we stay in a haunted hotel,

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.994 align:middle line:84%
I always clear the room and
make sure everything is out.

00:43:58.994 --> 00:44:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You have to teach
us how to do that, though.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.840 align:middle line:84%
What are some good
tools that we can

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
use, because we go into
plenty of haunted hotel?

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: I know that it's
not possible to travel

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.580 align:middle line:10%
with cedar all the time but
it's really great if you

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.920 align:middle line:10%
can get some cedar.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the spiritual
community has

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.770 align:middle line:84%
an idea that sage is
what clear things,

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:21.260 align:middle line:84%
but sage actually
blesses things.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And cedar is used to clear.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So I really urge people to
get some cedar and cedar

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.530 align:middle line:90%
out your body, your house.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.205 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really good
tool to clear things.

00:44:33.205 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's a good thing
to put in a suitcase, too.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:36.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a great idea.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.155 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
take a look here

00:44:38.155 --> 00:44:40.400 align:middle line:84%
at another beautiful
picture of you

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
a mountain range.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.420 align:middle line:90%
And this beautiful dress.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: This is actually almost
at the top of the mountain

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:51.560 align:middle line:84%
at a place in Scotland
on the Isle of Skye

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:90%
called the Fairy Pools.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a series of pools
that are just beautiful.

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.100 align:middle line:90%
They're very magical.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:03.650 align:middle line:84%
The water is unbelievable,
you want to bless yourself

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:05.300 align:middle line:90%
with this water.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, turquoise blue pools.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And our driver said,
yes, you should hike up

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to the very top pool because
it's the most spectacular.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
blue dress with me

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that I was carrying
just in a bag

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that we were going to
do a photo shoot in.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And we walked by all
the Fairy Pools going,

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.060 align:middle line:84%
oh, well we're not
at the last one yet.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And we hiked I think for
two hours to the very top

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and then finally
realized, oh, we

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.760 align:middle line:90%
went way past the Fair Pools.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So we went ahead and
did a photo shoot.

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And it was just was so funny.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Our driver was so
worried about us

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.150 align:middle line:84%
because three hours
later we came back

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and he was scared we
were gone forever.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But this mountain,
it was so magical.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those
moments like right out of "Lord

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:09.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Rings" where you go, wow,
we are in a very magical place.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:14.240 align:middle line:10%
That landscape all around me
in the summertime turns purple.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.650 align:middle line:90%
It's heather.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Where is this?

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.036 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: On the Isle
of Skye in Scotland.

00:46:22.036 --> 00:46:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And the Fairy Pools,
is that what they're called?

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They're
Fairy Pools, yes.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.255 align:middle line:90%
You can ask anybody.

00:46:27.255 --> 00:46:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You can even ask anybody, I
want to go to the Fairy Pools

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.129 align:middle line:84%
and they'll tell
you where they are.

00:46:31.129 --> 00:46:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And because of
the color, and the energy,

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.140 align:middle line:84%
you said, is very
intense and beautiful.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: There were, literally,
the tribe known as Fairies

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:90%
standing all along these pools.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.980 align:middle line:10%
These tall, really
beautiful beings

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.730 align:middle line:10%
that I saw throughout
Scotland and the UK,

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:55.720 align:middle line:10%
they told me that
they are the Fairies,

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.300 align:middle line:10%
that they are the
tribe of beings

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.570 align:middle line:10%
that are magical beings that
were there to help the people.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.994 align:middle line:90%
And they were just exquisite.

00:47:04.994 --> 00:47:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow, that's amazing.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.659 align:middle line:84%
You could go, and
you could feel you

00:47:07.659 --> 00:47:09.590 align:middle line:84%
could tap into
these energies based

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.650 align:middle line:84%
on your stories and your
books and really experience

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:14.410 align:middle line:90%
the culture in a different ways.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:17.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole new
level of tourism.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.960 align:middle line:84%
You actually do, you take groups
there, in various locations.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Where have you gone with groups?

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I've taught several
retreats up in Scotland.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And also I've taught in England.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just love being able
to share that with people

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and have them feel the energy
and talk to them about what's

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:37.940 align:middle line:90%
going on there.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What's your
favorite place?

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Do you have one?

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: My favorite place
in terms of spirit travels

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is Hagar Qim, and this
is on the Isle of Malta.

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:51.380 align:middle line:84%
It's considered the oldest
religious ceremonial site

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.800 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's huge,
huge, huge stones.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's this maze of rooms.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:01.650 align:middle line:10%
And I have a whole chapter
on it in "Spirit Traveler,"

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:07.080 align:middle line:10%
but it is incredible because the
woman, the being, the goddess

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.960 align:middle line:10%
who takes care of it,
was there to greet me

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:10%
when I spirit traveled there.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And she walked me through
this long hallway,

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and she had me experience what
they were the caretakers of,

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.840 align:middle line:90%
which was duality.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into the one
room and it was bliss.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It was like my whole
being went into bliss.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I never wanted to
leave that room.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And I came out and she
sent me into the next room,

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:39.540 align:middle line:90%
and it was terror.

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It was the scariest,
worst feelings

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I've ever felt in my life, and
I came out of there really fast.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:54.060 align:middle line:10%
And I stood in the middle and
she said, we are in that time--

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.470 align:middle line:10%
and she's still there--

00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:00.090 align:middle line:10%
the caretakers of this
energy called duality.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And we kept the Earth
in balance by keeping

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.810 align:middle line:84%
these two rooms,
these two spaces,

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.090 align:middle line:90%
we kept the world in balance.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: What must she
think now about the Earth

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:13.020 align:middle line:90%
being so out of balance?

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well yes, and of course
Hagar Qim is a ruins site now.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:22.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not in its full glory.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The thing about the
demigods is that they know

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.850 align:middle line:90%
about the changes that happen.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.120 align:middle line:84%
They understand duality
is splitting apart,

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and they understand that
we're making a big shift

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.400 align:middle line:90%
as a race of beings.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:90%
So they're here to help us.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:42.810 align:middle line:84%
They've never gone away,
they've never gone away.

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Well I think about
all the people

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:48.180 align:middle line:84%
who are connected to
the Egyptian gods.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And they call on Sekhmet,
they call on Ra, Hathor,

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.270 align:middle line:90%
they call on the gods.

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:55.980 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I think
that's is something

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:58.770 align:middle line:10%
that we do still today.

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:03.090 align:middle line:10%
Different cultures, different
places all over the earth

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:04.470 align:middle line:10%
still look to them.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:07.415 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Absolutely, faith,
it's all about faith.

00:50:07.415 --> 00:50:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And whatever it is that
you are faithful to,

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:12.990 align:middle line:84%
you can call on
that level of faith

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.950 align:middle line:90%
and ask for help for our planet.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of things being done,

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:23.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's got to still stay into
a place of deep prayer, asking,

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and faith, and action.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And by going into deep prayer
and faith and meditation,

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:39.060 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability as
people to access inner peace

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.760 align:middle line:84%
because inner peace
is in our soul body,

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.100 align:middle line:90%
it's what we came here with.

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
fourth dimension, we

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:51.930 align:middle line:84%
spent a long time trying to
find peace outside of ourselves.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:54.780 align:middle line:10%
That's what duality
does, duality takes us

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.419 align:middle line:10%
outside of ourselves.

00:50:56.419 --> 00:50:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And you and I might
look at something

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh, that's bad.

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Or we might look at something
and go, oh, that's really good.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.920 align:middle line:84%
But we've looked
outside of ourselves

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.550 align:middle line:84%
to measure whether it's
good or bad, right or wrong.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:12.720 align:middle line:10%
And inner peace allows
us to stand in the center

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.270 align:middle line:10%
and really access
that inner measuring

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:18.610 align:middle line:10%
system we have in our soul
body, which is the good and bad,

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:21.574 align:middle line:10%
right and wrong that we
innately came here with.

00:51:21.574 --> 00:51:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: As humans, we
were delivered with good

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and bad, right and
wrong, weren't we?

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you
about your new book,

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:31.260 align:middle line:90%
"Dancing with Raven and Bear."

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.250 align:middle line:84%
First, let's take a
look at the trailer.

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:39.630 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The journey
of my ancestors

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.160 align:middle line:90%
began in two different worlds.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.130 align:middle line:84%
One in the north where
Odin and the Norse gods

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:51.600 align:middle line:84%
wove tales of magic, and one
in the south where my Hopi

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.510 align:middle line:84%
ancestors called
to me from the past

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and show me the
magic of the Earth.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:01.740 align:middle line:84%
When Raven and Bear came
into my life, I was a child.

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:05.580 align:middle line:10%
And through my art I
brought them into reality.

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.940 align:middle line:84%
They are powerful teachers,
and they guide the reader

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.870 align:middle line:84%
through life challenges
like releasing pain, mending

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:17.940 align:middle line:84%
a broken heart, and holding
darkness and depression at bay.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.430 align:middle line:84%
The Earth teaches
Bear about dreaming

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and the messages
hidden in our dreams.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:26.910 align:middle line:84%
A star being traveling
the galaxy listening

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:31.980 align:middle line:84%
to the songs each planet sings
hears the distinctive voice

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.120 align:middle line:90%
of Bear.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.400 align:middle line:84%
This encounter helps
us to understand

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.160 align:middle line:90%
the magic of the universe.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Earth medicine is potent,
and Raven and Bear

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.560 align:middle line:84%
discover that each element on
Earth holds a lesson for us.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.330 align:middle line:84%
The animals teach us what it
means to walk a medicine path,

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and why that road is
fraught with danger

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:56.880 align:middle line:90%
and not for everyone.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The voice of my ancestors take
me to a place that is still.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:05.160 align:middle line:84%
There I experience the
Earth and her teachings.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It is her voice that echoes
through these stories, guiding

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Raven and Bear and
showing us the medicine

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:16.230 align:middle line:90%
and the magic of her realm.

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Tell me the
story of Raven and Bear

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:20.250 align:middle line:90%
in a quick way, if you can.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I have always been
connected to Raven and Bear.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm an artist, I've been an
artist since I began dancing.

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I was also painting.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.270 align:middle line:90%
My mom's an artist.

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So while I danced, I also
painted and drew pictures.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And Raven and Bear were
always a part of my art

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:90%
since I was a child.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And I did not realize
how much I was tapping

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:45.060 align:middle line:84%
into my Native
American heritage,

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:48.720 align:middle line:84%
being Choctaw and Cherokee,
and also my Norwegian heritage.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So all of my connections to
my heritages has come through.

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And I tell these stories
of Raven and Bear

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.540 align:middle line:90%
in my Native tradition.

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So Raven is one
character and Bear is

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.200 align:middle line:84%
the other, and they
represent both of your--

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They represent
all of my heritage.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But I share these stories
more in my Native heritage.

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Raven's are
trickster and someone

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:18.630 align:middle line:90%
who is always helping Bear.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And Bear as a
medicine man who is

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:23.610 align:middle line:90%
helping people and the world.

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And each story is
about different things

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.590 align:middle line:90%
that we all deal with.

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Dealing with loss and
pain, dealing with death,

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:37.320 align:middle line:84%
dealing with love,
dealing with having

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:42.090 align:middle line:84%
a calling to be a spiritual
healer or someone who

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:44.160 align:middle line:90%
is helping people.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.080 align:middle line:84%
All of these stories
throughout the book

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:50.730 align:middle line:84%
are helping the
reader better define

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:54.060 align:middle line:84%
what their relationship
is to that emotion

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.972 align:middle line:90%
and how they can best navigate.

00:54:56.972 --> 00:54:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So different
pieces of themselves

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.510 align:middle line:90%
they'll find in Raven or Bear.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: In both, yes.

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:03.484 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In both,
throughout the whole story.

00:55:03.484 --> 00:55:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the newest
book that's coming out.

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, and
my original artwork

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.600 align:middle line:90%
is all through the book.

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited about that.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Yeah, as an artist,
it must be exciting.

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I know we have
Raven and Bear on.

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.031 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I have Raven
on, you have Bear on.

00:55:17.031 --> 00:55:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Sonja made
these, they're great.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So I always ask my
guests, in the end,

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:23.210 align:middle line:90%
what is your biggest why?

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do what you do?

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And I love that
question, because what I ask

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:90%
is, why not?

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Why not, why not let go
of what you're resisting?

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Why not let go of
that story that you've

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.690 align:middle line:90%
been telling since 1974?

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:41.370 align:middle line:90%
We've heard it a hundred times.

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:46.740 align:middle line:10%
Why not let go of the
pain and suffering

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:51.190 align:middle line:10%
and whatever it is that we
identify with as who we are?

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Why not just for a moment
let go and experience

00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.780 align:middle line:84%
what I just talked
about, that inner peace?

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Experience who you are
through meditation,

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.860 align:middle line:84%
experience releasing
the emotional wounds

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.470 align:middle line:90%
that we've carried for so long.

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And if people hear me say this
and go, but I don't know how,

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:12.420 align:middle line:90%
they should call me.

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:16.740 align:middle line:10%
And secondly, they
should also really

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.880 align:middle line:10%
think about what you
mentioned, which is faith.

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:25.380 align:middle line:10%
Because that's a really big
part of how we as a species

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.890 align:middle line:10%
will continue on is faith.

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Forever, we always have.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.110 align:middle line:90%
It's always been like that.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Belief, belief, belief,
in whatever it is.

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And then belief got control
because people in power

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:41.790 align:middle line:84%
realized the value of
belief and how strong

00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:44.520 align:middle line:90%
it can influence a culture.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:50.970 align:middle line:10%
And it was misused for a
while, and it still has been.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.400 align:middle line:10%
But now I think, and
what you're saying,

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.860 align:middle line:10%
and what your
example really is, is

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.710 align:middle line:10%
someone who can have
their own belief

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:01.620 align:middle line:10%
and really make a difference
in the world with it.

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to you individually
to make that difference.

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you're a
perfect example of how

00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:12.540 align:middle line:84%
individual people can make
such a difference in the world.

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:13.890 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Well thank you so
much for sharing

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.270 align:middle line:84%
your journeys and
your travels with us,

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and showing us a whole new
way of spirit traveling.

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And also teaching us about
our own healing abilities.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.924 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.
