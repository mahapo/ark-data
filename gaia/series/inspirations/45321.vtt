00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA GARR: Hi.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.673 align:middle line:84%
I'm Lisa Garr, host of
Gaiam "Inspirations."

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:84%
We are broadcasting from
the Conscious Life Expo

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:90%
here in Los Angeles.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So have you been studying
consciousness for a long time,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and you find that you
are resorting back

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to those bad habits, and
they never really change?

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, joining me
is Dr. Dain Heer.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:84%
He is the co-creator of
Access Consciousness which

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is being taught in 40
countries around the world

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:90%
for the past 15 years.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dain has joined me before
on Gaiam "Inspirations."

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted him to come
back, because I wanted

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
you to actually see some
of the techniques of Access

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.646 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to hear
more about Dain's story,

00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
you can watch the replays of
my past interviews with him.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.772 align:middle line:84%
But he's here to share with us,
for the first time on camera,

00:00:57.772 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
some of the techniques
of Access Consciousness.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAIN HEER: Welcome.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It's so great to be with you.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I am so excited.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: As am I.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: We haven't gotten
a chance to do this.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I've been in some
of your workshops.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced the energy,
which is phenomenal and not

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:90%
from this planet.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to say
much more about that.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
See, what I find is if-- one
of the things that happens

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
is if you tell somebody
it's not from here

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, they tend to
make that part significant.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Uh-huh.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.435 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: What I'd
rather have them

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:84%
have is an experience of the
energy, use some of this,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and see what it
changes in their lives.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.662 align:middle line:84%
Because if they get that,
then it'll be theirs forever.

00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So one of
the things that I

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
love about you is that you
have an absolute fierce passion

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:90%
for the truth.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:90%
You cannot be any other way.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Gets me in
trouble sometimes.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
But I'm one of these
people that-- you know,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and I won't impose
it on anybody else.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But to have somebody speak
something in my presence

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.699 align:middle line:84%
that's not actually
what's going on--

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It doesn't fit does it?

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.031 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: No, it's grating.

00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
nails on a chalkboard.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.942 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love your
perspectives on things.

00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:02.525 align:middle line:90%
They're fresh.

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:90%
They're unique.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But they are also
sometimes shocking to me.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I had been so
enrolled in the process that,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.232 align:middle line:90%
oh, self-help helps everyone.

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Right.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So I mean, what is
your perspective about why

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
people don't change and have
repeated bad habits over

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and over, and then they
seem to just take over

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:90%
like a hungry lion?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, I think there
are many-- we could have

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.609 align:middle line:84%
an entire show on just that
one question, as you know.

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: But one of the
things is that what

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught to do is to
come to conclusion in our lives

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.916 align:middle line:84%
rather than function
from question.

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And what do I mean by that?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.435 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's say you're unhappy.

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
You know there's
something different.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.517 align:middle line:84%
And so you pick up
a book about angels.

00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh my
god, angels are the answer.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.183 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:02:51.183 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Because that
was your next step.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
But what if that's
just one piece

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
of an entire universe
of possibilities?

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.227 align:middle line:84%
And what people do is they
stop themselves with angels.

00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you come up to them
and you're like, oh my god,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.494 align:middle line:90%
my left ankle hurts.

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what to do.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, oh my god,
you need to see an angel.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
You need to pray
to an angel right

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
now, because angels
are the answer.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.639 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're saying
is that that's just

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
the first step, because it
might go beyond the angels.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's why so
many different people

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
look for other
modalities in self-help,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:90%
because it's a layering process?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: What I'd say is rather
than even being a first step,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
what if you could have
angels and you could have,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't know,
vibrational healing?

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And you could have your
awareness of asking questions.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And you could have POC and POD,
one of my personal favorites,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
which is where you can
undo what hasn't changed.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And what if you could
have body processes?

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
let's not just focus

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
on this tiny little
piece of the pie.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like one grain
of sand on the beach.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's have the entire
beach, and the ocean,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and the trees, and the
waves, and the sun,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.236 align:middle line:90%
and have all of it?

00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Is that how
you live your life?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Completely full?

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: As often
as I possibly can.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:90%
You know, and that's the thing.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh my gosh, you
must be conscious of perfect.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I'm sorry,
who are you looking at?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I got my life.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I do my best
to walk my talk.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:90%
I don't claim to be perfect.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim to be
totally conscious.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.476 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim to
be totally aware.

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.393 align:middle line:84%
But I'm doing my darnedest
to become that way.

00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:24.726 align:middle line:84%
And when you say, is that the
way I'm living in my life,

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:26.530 align:middle line:84%
it's like, to the
best of my ability.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Do I screw up sometimes?

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Heck yeah.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I love about
Access Consciousness is

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
our definition of
consciousness is

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
where everything exists
and nothing is judged.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, even when
you screw up, you

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.279 align:middle line:84%
don't have to make
yourself wrong for it.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But you don't seem to care
what other people think

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:90%
when you do screw up.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.983 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: That's true.

00:04:45.983 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Where does
that come from?

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: I'm not sure.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.892 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I think part of where it
comes from for me personally

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.047 align:middle line:84%
is-- and I don't know
if I've said this on air

00:04:54.047 --> 00:04:55.880 align:middle line:84%
with you before, but
it's like-- I literally

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:90%
grew up in the ghetto, OK?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I was the only white child you
saw for eight square miles.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.855 align:middle line:84%
Now that didn't matter
until I was eight years old,

00:05:02.855 --> 00:05:04.271 align:middle line:84%
and I got beaten
up the first time

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:06.480 align:middle line:84%
for being a different
color than everybody else.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I experienced
a huge amount of abuse

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
while I was growing up
there, mental, physical,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
psychological, and a lot of
sexual and physical abuse.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, so that set
me up to the point

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
where 14 years ago, I
was going to kill myself.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't seem to be able
to do anything successfully.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.105 align:middle line:84%
I felt like everything I did,
no matter what technique I did,

00:05:28.105 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
seminar I went to,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I always thought I
found the answer,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.594 align:middle line:84%
and then by
Wednesday morning, it

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:34.659 align:middle line:84%
felt like the world crashed
in on my head again.

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And I got to this place that
gave me, what I would say,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:90%
is total freedom.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I got to a place where I
went, you know what, universe?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.952 align:middle line:84%
I am tired of trying to make
the world a more aware place.

00:05:44.952 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired of trying to make
the world a better place.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:84%
If my life has to feel like
this, I'm killing myself.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.299 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: You got six months.

00:05:52.299 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Either my life changes,
or I'm out of here.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.756 align:middle line:84%
And I was dead serious in
more ways than one possibly.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm-hmm.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And I
literally thought I

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:84%
was going to get to
end it and leave.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd made my
demand, and I thought,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing that's
going to change it.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I've done everything
that possibly could.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And along came
Access Consciousness.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Within one session of
doing something called

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:84%
The Bars, which is these
32 points on the head, I

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
literally, as soon as the
woman started the session

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and put her hands on my
head, I felt this energy move

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
through my body that
was like liquid peace

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and love combined--

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: -and,
like, being cradled

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:90%
in the arms of the universe.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And I started crying and
laughing at the same time.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.184 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:06:29.184 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I got up after this
session, and I never

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.842 align:middle line:84%
contemplated killing
myself again.

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:34.175 align:middle line:90%
But in answer to your question--

00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: But why?

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.057 align:middle line:84%
Because you found
something else?

00:06:37.057 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: That's a great question.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.848 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Did you
find purpose there?

00:06:39.848 --> 00:06:41.061 align:middle line:90%
Did you find peace?

00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:90%
What did you find?

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: It was a
sense of belonging,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:90%
a sense of no wrongness.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Belonging to what?

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.028 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Everything.

00:06:50.028 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Something greater?

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well everything
is definitely

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.119 align:middle line:84%
greater than who I
was being at the time.

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: But it was a sense
of belonging to the universe

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
really and having the
universe belong with me.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Because I felt so separate.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.933 align:middle line:84%
When you feel-- you know,
and I hope nobody out

00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:90%
there is experiencing this.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure a lot
of people probably

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.820 align:middle line:84%
are more than they're even
invited to acknowledge,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.102 align:middle line:90%
which is the sad part for me.

00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can acknowledge
it, you can change it.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But what I was
experiencing was when

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
you feel this depression, when
you feel this unhappiness,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
it's like you feel
like somehow you

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:90%
must be doing something wrong.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I had all
the books on my shelf.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That told you
how to do it right.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Exactly.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And you all the books
I have, because you probably

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:90%
have them on your shelf.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And probably
a lot of people

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:84%
at home have them on
their shelves, right?

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.331 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And still I was
waking up feeling this way

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.019 align:middle line:84%
and living feeling
this way putting

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:39.309 align:middle line:90%
one foot in front of the other.

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And I knew there had to
be something different.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you say, what did
I get after this session,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like I
got out of wrongness

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.602 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in my life.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I got out of the sense that
I should be disconnected,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and I was somehow a
bad person or a bad guy

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
or something, which was really
what I had inflicted on me when

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:90%
my body was abused.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at one
point, I had women

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
standing over my
hitting me with belts

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to try to prove that I
was wrong for being a man.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And how do you take that
and those experiences?

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'd say to
anybody who's ever been abused,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:84%
If you've broken that cycle,
and you're not doing it

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to other people,
you far more courage

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever acknowledged.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And you are here to
change the world.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.848 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with you.

00:08:25.848 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: In that
pattern of abuse,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.667 align:middle line:84%
there is such a
violation of trust

00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
that, especially if it's done
from a parent or a loved one,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
that it completely breaks that
trust or your relationship

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
with the world
forever after that.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
How do you put
that back together?

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: I want to say one thing.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.727 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like that, it
changes your relationship

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:48.685 align:middle line:90%
with the world forever.

00:08:48.685 --> 00:08:49.268 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:08:49.268 --> 00:08:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: What I found with
Access Consciousness is

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to
be forever anymore.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:90%
That forever can change.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
That forever can
stop working-- See,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.982 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate
to be able to come

00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
into Access
Consciousness at a time

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
where the founder, Gary
Douglas, who has been around

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:84%
for 25 years, he literally had
time to take me under his wing.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:90%
And we started working together.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And I started actually
being able to contribute.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And within about two years
of coming into Access,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I had divulged this,
that I'd been hiding

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
in my world, this thing
about having been abused.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.031 align:middle line:84%
Because I was getting
the visuals of it,

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I was getting the awareness of

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
it, and it was starting to
come into my world again.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, I
thought I was over this.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.325 align:middle line:84%
And with his help, because we
function from asking questions,

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
with his help, I
actually got to the place

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:84%
where I finally
did undo all of it,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
where it no longer ran any
part of my life anymore.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You
reestablished the trust?

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: I basically
reestablished the trust--

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You did.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.131 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: --in me and
in the universe.

00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And I realized, you know what?

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.957 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anything wrong
with me that made that happen.

00:09:56.957 --> 00:09:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say that again to
everybody out there listening.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.915 align:middle line:84%
If you've experienced
abuse, it's

00:10:00.915 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
not because there's
something wrong with you.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at that,
abuse is an intense experience

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of the sense of
wrongness, the sense you

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:90%
must be doing something wrong.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at that as sort
of a far end of the spectrum

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
of things you can
experience, if you

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:84%
go back to what a lot of
people are experiencing,

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
they're still experiencing a
sense of the wrongness of them.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They still have
a sense that wow,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
this relationship didn't
work out because I was wrong.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Every day, right?

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.919 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: My mother doesn't
love me because I was wrong.

00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Any of those things that
they're experiencing

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
or have as their point of view
about the wrongness of them,

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that
change dynamically

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:84%
with the people
who come to Access

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:90%
and actually use the tools.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
the greatest gifts

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I can think of giving somebody,
them getting out of the idea

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:90%
that they're actually wrong.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, how does this Bars
technique release that or start

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:90%
to release that in someone.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: You know, I'll
tell you from my awareness

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:90%
of what it does.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.997 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: I can't actually
tell you scientifically.

00:10:58.997 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Because all I know is
what it doesn't energetically.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
If somebody out there wants to
come and study it, and tell us

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:84%
why it does what it does, I
would so love to hear that.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.155 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:07.655 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:07.655 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: But it's
like this, as far

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
as I can tell you--
so there are 32

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.690 align:middle line:90%
different points on the head.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
They have names like joy,
and sadness, money, body,

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:90%
sexuality, aging, creativity.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
as you hold that point,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.470 align:middle line:84%
the positive and negative
charge that you've

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:84%
developed around that
subject starts dissipating.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Inside me?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Inside of you.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And so
what happens, it's

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
like the person working on
you just gives you the space.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
They're just being there with
you touching these points

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
really lightly,
whatever the point is.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And what happens is
that starts dissipating for you.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
positive and negative

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that creates the
static in our lives.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So they don't have to
bring in the light from God

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and the universe and all
the angels sing and then

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.739 align:middle line:90%
the points--

00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Right.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.001 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:11:53.001 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: No.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that's the
wonderful part about this

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is that there's no form, no
structure, no significance

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And thing about it is--

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I'm not saying, by the
way, that that light from God

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and the angels and the
universe doesn't sing.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.558 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Right, exactly.

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: But I'm saying
anyone can do this.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Anyone can do it.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Once you learn it.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: That's exactly the
point is anybody can do it.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people
you'd least expect

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.459 align:middle line:84%
would be good at it are some
of the best people at it

00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.395 align:middle line:84%
Because they just sit there
with no point of view.

00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And they just love
to contribute.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And the thing
that you were saying

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
about the angels
and the light of God

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and all of that, what
I've noticed is people

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
start to recognize,
wow, I am the angels.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.521 align:middle line:90%
I am the light of God.

00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.765 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: We are actually oneness.

00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:33.306 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Nice.

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:34.298 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:12:34.298 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.454 align:middle line:84%
Well, Dain is going
to do this on me--

00:12:37.454 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Oh, yay.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: --and give me the
opportunity to experience this.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yay!

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.693 align:middle line:84%
So first thing is you don't
want your hands crossing.

00:12:43.693 --> 00:12:44.322 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:12:44.322 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: You want them
actually like that.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing is if
you cross your fingers,

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.880 align:middle line:90%
the energy of this stops.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.088 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the only times
there's "don't" in Access.

00:12:51.088 --> 00:12:51.755 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, wow.

00:12:51.755 --> 00:12:53.338 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: So what I'm
going to do, guys,

00:12:53.338 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to show
you just a few of these.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And even a few of these,
though, if you just get these,

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:90%
they're really simple.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm going
to show them to you

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
is because they're
really simple to find,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:90%
they're really easy to learn.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this-- I'll
talk to you a little bit more

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:84%
as we go, as we work on Lisa--
but basically what happens

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:84%
is the place we're
going to start

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
is with something
called the Energy Pool.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.015 align:middle line:84%
And what you want to
do-- see, most people

00:13:16.015 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
don't have that much energy
running in their bodies

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
unless they sort of
exercise, unless they

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:90%
connect with them in some way.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:84%
What this can do--
and this works really

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
well for people who are sort of
disconnected from their bodies

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.440 align:middle line:84%
or people who have a
disease process going on.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Because in a disease
process, your body

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
stops the energy
it has available.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's waken this up,
bring it to life again.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.598 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it's not just for
disease process, however.

00:13:39.598 --> 00:13:40.235 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:40.235 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:84%
You're going to put one hand
on the back of the head.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.890 align:middle line:84%
If you are
anatomically inclined,

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:90%
you call it the octopus.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm sorry the occiput.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Bad doctor, bad doctor.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:84%
You call it the occiput,
OK, or the octopus.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you put three
fingers on the third eye.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, what you're
doing right now is

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
you're just asking for the
energy to come from the earth,

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
through her feet, through
her body, through your hands,

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.689 align:middle line:90%
and out the top of your head.

00:14:06.689 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It feels like you
just put a helmet on my head,

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.267 align:middle line:90%
I mean, an energy helmet.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Right?

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.396 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: And you feel it.

00:14:13.396 --> 00:14:14.597 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, whoa, OK.

00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And what happens, now,
if you're at home watching,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
what I'd invite
you to do is just

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
put your feet on the floor, and
feel your feet on the floor.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.475 align:middle line:84%
Feel your butt on the couch
or wherever you're sitting.

00:14:28.475 --> 00:14:29.344 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Take a breath.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: And just take a breath.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And notice if you don't start to
perceive some lightness or some

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:84%
of this starting
to work for you.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is in doing it on Lisa

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and her body, what
happens is our bodies

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:90%
resonate like each other.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Like if you've ever seen a
seven-year-old child that

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
walks exactly like their
40-year-old parent,

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:90%
why is that?

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Because their bodies
learn to resonate.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And it creates the same
places where they stop moving

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:90%
and keep moving.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
This is actually using that
resonance on our behalf

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:90%
instead of against us.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So now Lisa's done
in this direction.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
to ask the energy

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:84%
to go the other direction,
out through her feet.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, if she were lying on a
table, which is one common way

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:90%
this is done.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I would be at her feet,
pulling the energy that way.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going, OK,
now go this way, please.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And the funny part is, now,
I was taught visualization.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was OK at it.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:90%
But my mind was so frantic.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I would go, and
I would visualize

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.229 align:middle line:84%
what they wanted me to
visualize in like half a moment.

00:15:32.229 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:33.675 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Have you
ever done that, Lisa?

00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: You visualize what
they want you to visualize.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you think of
28 other permutations.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you think
you didn't do it.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're not sure
you're doing it.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:84%
You're not sure
you're doing it right.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, then you
think about when you were six,

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.815 align:middle line:84%
and somebody asked
you to do something.

00:15:43.815 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
out of it, right?

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:45.731 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Well, with this,
all you have to do is ask.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:90%
All you have to do is ask.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to visualize it.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Or you can.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:90%
That's fine, too.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
See, and one of the things is,
it's like one of the things

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.439 align:middle line:84%
that we don't often
think about is--

00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:04.105 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want
your hands to touch--

00:16:04.105 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, thank you.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: --or your
head might explode.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: OK, don't
want that to happen.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.335 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And I really want
to be responsible for that

00:16:07.335 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam television.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.199 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right.

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:11.615 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: I'll be known as the
guy who exploded Lisa's head.

00:16:11.615 --> 00:16:12.698 align:middle line:90%
I'll be like, sorry, guys.

00:16:12.698 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I loved her, too.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:90%
I really did.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.166 align:middle line:90%
I'm really sorry.

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:17.522 align:middle line:90%
All my fault.

00:16:17.522 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I love your
sense of humor.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:90%
It's so great.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: So it's like this.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It's really where
what this can be

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
is just a contribution
to everything for you.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.456 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you put your hands
up like this, please.

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:31.961 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like that, there we go.

00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm putting
my middle finger

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.539 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of her palms
and her middle finger

00:16:35.539 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of mine.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this time the
energy's going in her head,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.724 align:middle line:84%
through her arms, through mine,
and out the top of my head.

00:16:42.724 --> 00:16:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Now if you were to do nothing
other than these first three

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:90%
things I just showed you--

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, are you feeling
the exchange of energy here?

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Or are you just a neutral
kind of conduit for the energy

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:90%
to flow?

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: I'm kind of
just being with you.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:90%
And also I'm perceiving it.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.403 align:middle line:90%
Like, are you noticing it?

00:17:00.403 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Are you noticing sort of--
well, how would you describe it,

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.710 align:middle line:90%
that would be a good addition.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Neutral.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.899 align:middle line:90%
Absolute neutrality.

00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:08.322 align:middle line:90%
And total calming.

00:17:08.322 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Complete calming.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:90%
And the monkey mind went away.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:11.205 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:17:11.205 --> 00:17:12.679 align:middle line:90%
And isn't it interesting?

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Within three minutes we have
the monkey mind already starting

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:90%
to go away.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.271 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:18.115 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: That monkey
mind is not your friend.

00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:19.490 align:middle line:84%
That monkey mind
is not something

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:90%
that contributes to you.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
detracts from you.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Let's change that.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And this changes it more
dynamically than almost

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:26.632 align:middle line:90%
anything I know.

00:17:26.632 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to say, having
worked with thousands of people

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.195 align:middle line:84%
with this around
the world, literally

00:17:31.195 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this start to be
a major component in undoing

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:90%
depression in people.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: So of course--

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Total--

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Sorry, you can put
your hands back on your--

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I don't want to.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.245 align:middle line:90%
I'm want to--

00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:42.869 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: I know.

00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:90%
You're like, no.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.348 align:middle line:90%
Keep going, baby.

00:17:44.348 --> 00:17:45.072 align:middle line:90%
Raise the roof.

00:17:45.072 --> 00:17:45.504 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Raise the roof.

00:17:45.504 --> 00:17:47.585 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Raise the
roof of possibilities.

00:17:47.585 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: You get giddy.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: I know.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.765 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I want to play.

00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:51.556 align:middle line:90%
I want to have fun.

00:17:51.556 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: And you know what?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Your hands are touching.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.012 align:middle line:90%
So we know what that means.

00:17:54.012 --> 00:17:54.511 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah!

00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: So the
next one-- and I'll

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
show you probably
two or three more,

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:90%
just so we can give you a sense.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
These are some of
the most dynamic ones

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:90%
that we have that we run.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.911 align:middle line:84%
So behind the ear, if
you put your finger--

00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:84%
let's turn your head this
way just a little bit.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you put your hands right
behind the person's ears.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, not down on an
neck, that's different.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Right behind the ears.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go over a
ridge and into a valley.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:84%
In other works, they'll be
just like this little bump.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
your fingers will rest there.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.687 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the
beginning of the Bars.

00:18:26.687 --> 00:18:28.520 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that
we did was sort of-- we

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.492 align:middle line:90%
call this the Energy Pool.

00:18:30.492 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The first three things that we
did we call the Energy Pool.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And those are just designed
to get the energy moving.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
What this is called is something
called the Implant Band.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:90%
And what's an implant?

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, how much-- how many of
the points of view have you

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.320 align:middle line:84%
perceived around you in
the world that kind of

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
run your life, but they're
not even your point of view?

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.150 align:middle line:90%
That would be like an implant.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you could imagine
somebody coming along-- like,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, have you
ever known somebody

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.600 align:middle line:84%
who they had a mother
or something who

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
would come along and poke
and push their buttons?

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Uh-huh.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:90%
You're like, uh-huh, I do.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I can think
about that, yeah..

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.674 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And what happens
is those buttons act

00:19:10.674 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:90%
kind of like implants.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Like the person pushes them.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And they activate.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And the person gets all
hot under the collar,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even
know what happened.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
What this is doing
is it's actually

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:90%
dissipating those buttons.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It's basically getting
rid of your hot buttons.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.058 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we say
about the Bars is it's

00:19:26.058 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:84%
like defragging your hard
drive, upgrading your operating

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
system, getting a new monitor,
getting a new keyboard,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and going on with an
anti-virus program that

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.201 align:middle line:84%
keeps it from ever
happening again.

00:19:36.201 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: So it's kind of-- and
do you notice a sense of space?

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Totally.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:90%
That--- yes.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: It's like, oh.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: So guys watching at
home-- guys, ladies, people,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:84%
dogs, animals, whatever-- you
want to notice if you just

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.892 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes
for just a moment,

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
notice if there's anything
changing in your body.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Notice if there's any sense
of more space or just more

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:90%
quietness perhaps.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, some
of us may notice it

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:90%
more readily than others.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, please
don't make yourself wrong.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the exact opposite
of what this is about.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
What this really is
about is starting

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:84%
to come out of the
wrongness of you.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: It's like I had a
bunch of furniture in my head.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.789 align:middle line:84%
And the furniture is-- it's a
one, giant, gorgeous open room.

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And that's the
space from which to create.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:29.841 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:20:29.841 --> 00:20:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.873 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And that's
exactly what it is.

00:20:31.873 --> 00:20:34.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the space from
which to create.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
See, it's interesting, because
we have this concept of space

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:90%
as though it's empty.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It's actually that space
where the potential

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%
for all possibilities exists.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just we've been
taught that it's empty.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But physicists are now
talking about the idea

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that space is actually
where the real action is,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%
where the real mojo exists.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: In the space?

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.291 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:20:58.291 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Which is kind
of an interesting idea

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that physicists are
now starting to prove

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.005 align:middle line:84%
the very basics
of consciousness.

00:21:05.005 --> 00:21:07.046 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go to the
furthest end of physics

00:21:07.046 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:90%
to figure it out.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.746 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I could see that someone
would get into-- well, someone

00:21:11.746 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:84%
who meditates a lot would feel
this experience right now.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.249 align:middle line:84%
But I got here faster than
a 20, 30 minute meditation.

00:21:19.249 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
thing about it is we

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:84%
should have tools that
are as fast as possible.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is let's
say you meditate.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if you
could do this, and it

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.564 align:middle line:84%
would allow your
meditation to go

00:21:31.564 --> 00:21:33.872 align:middle line:90%
deeper and wider and greater.

00:21:33.872 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: See, it's
not about going,

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, let's
cut out meditation.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Instead.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.515 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Let's just do Bars.

00:21:38.515 --> 00:21:39.497 align:middle line:90%
It's like, why instead?

00:21:39.497 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:84%
That's like doing the
thing about the angels

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and only taking one
piece of the pie.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's increase the pie
we're willing to have.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's invite ourselves to the
universe of possibilities.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.304 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:21:50.304 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: I know I sound
intense sometimes

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:90%
when I talk about that.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.846 align:middle line:84%
Next one we're going
to do-- I'm going

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.637 align:middle line:84%
to have you lean forward
just a little bit.

00:21:56.637 --> 00:21:58.651 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, just tilt your
head forward I mean.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.585 align:middle line:84%
You follow instructions
too well sometimes.

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:03.867 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this one is
called the Aging Toaster.

00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, do any of you have any
considerations about getting

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:84%
older, getting wrinkles,
and getting grey hair?

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Who of us doesn't, right?

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.003 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: You're on a
few of them actually.

00:22:14.003 --> 00:22:14.502 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:22:14.502 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: You're like don't
pan in, don't focus.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:90%
So here's the thing.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
The Aging Toaster is in line
with the inside of the eyes

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:90%
up on the top of the head.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
where the nose

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
is, the center line of the
head, just about a half

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:90%
an inch out from there.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So tilt your head forward
just a little bit more.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.922 align:middle line:84%
And you can tilt your
head up, because that

00:22:38.922 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:84%
tends to be a lot
more comfortable.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.213 align:middle line:84%
Now, usually you'd be
doing this on a table.

00:22:42.213 --> 00:22:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you're on a
table with somebody,

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:84%
let's say they're
lying down, you

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.575 align:middle line:84%
can just put your fingers
there like that really lightly.

00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Real gently.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's not applying
any pressure are all.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.546 align:middle line:90%
It's just moving energy.

00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: No pressure at all.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
it is this really

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.045 align:middle line:84%
is sort of the epitome of
ask and you shell receive.

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:01.672 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I was just thinking
of the word receive.

00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Ah.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:90%
So check this out.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we let people

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
know about the Bars is that
it literally, for some of us,

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:84%
is the first place where we
ever truly have the willingness

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:90%
to lie there and receive--

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: --or to receive period.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we're so busy
in our lives trying

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
to control everything and
trying to make it work

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.574 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make
it happen and trying

00:23:22.574 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to have everything be OK, that
we often forget that receiving

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:84%
is actually one of the keys to
having everything we desire.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It's also one of the keys to
creating change in the world.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And it's also one
of the least frequent things

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:84%
we do is receive, especially
us giving machines.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:44.791 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:46.121 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:23:46.121 --> 00:23:47.219 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:23:47.219 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the interesting
part is, like you mentioned,

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:50.820 align:middle line:90%
the giving machines.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Part of what this
starts to create

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:84%
is the place where you realize
you don't just have to give.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
You can not only receive,
but that that in itself

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:90%
is actually a gift.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: To receive a healing
is such a great gift.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a mom and
a busy working mom,

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.154 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving, giving,
giving, all day.

00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end of my day, I
give, give, give and give more.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And I give until I
can't give anymore sometimes.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And that for
all of us is basically

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of adrenal
fatigue, exhaustion,

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:90%
all that sort of thing.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is
interesting, because one

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of the things that I've
noticed with the people who've

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.600 align:middle line:84%
received Bars is what they'll
actually do is go hey,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.262 align:middle line:90%
can I get my Bars run please?

00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.345 align:middle line:84%
And they start to feel
rejuvenated and replenished

00:24:34.345 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
It changes the
physiology somehow.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
It seems to change it, so
that rather than functioning

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.640 align:middle line:84%
in these walls and these
barriers where it feels

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
like we're all alone, and
no one will give to us,

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.453 align:middle line:84%
and nothing will give to us, and
we don't know how to actually

00:24:47.453 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
get any energy in,
all of a sudden

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.280 align:middle line:84%
we start to have energy
available in our bodies.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: And this just by
touching these access points--

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yes.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that weird?

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: --that moves the energy?

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:57.535 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:24:57.535 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: That's incredible.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.733 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: That's what I
thought when I first had it.

00:25:00.733 --> 00:25:02.469 align:middle line:84%
This is literally
what saved my life.

00:25:02.469 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And I went, wait a
minute that was really simple.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.636 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was going to
be a lot harder than that.

00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.181 align:middle line:84%
So the next, we're just
going to do two more.

00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: OK.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Or actually, one
more right now-- you'll see.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.339 align:middle line:90%
So now, here's the funny part.

00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember which
side is which, guys.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
remember which side is which.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Just asking for where
the points are can help.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So right over the
middle of eyebrows

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.179 align:middle line:90%
there's joy and sadness.

00:25:33.179 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
which side is which.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:90%
One is joy, one is sadness.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But this is interesting, because
25 or 30 years ago, there

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:84%
was an article in
the "New York Times,"

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
where these scientists had
found that they had stimulated

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:90%
these points with an electrode.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And on one side if
they stimulated it,

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.629 align:middle line:90%
they could induce hours of joy.

00:25:50.629 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side
if they stimulate it,

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.324 align:middle line:84%
they could induce
hours of sadness.

00:25:54.324 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Who would want that?

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And what
was interesting was

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
we had just started
doing Bars at the time.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.909 align:middle line:84%
And we just started doing
Bars at the time and we went,

00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:02.492 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:03.941 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's interesting.

00:26:03.941 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.146 align:middle line:84%
So apparently science
is catching up.

00:26:08.146 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
So there's joy and sadness.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And then right up here,
basically in the same line--

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:84%
we had the Aging
Toaster right here,

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.302 align:middle line:84%
which deals with
issues of aging, which

00:26:17.302 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:84%
deals with all your points
of view about aging,

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:84%
about what it's like
when you get older,

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
what it has to be like,
and what it can be like,

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:23.933 align:middle line:90%
and what it won't be like.

00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: The Aging
Toaster part eliminates

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.490 align:middle line:84%
all of that concern about aging,
so that you can age gracefully.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yes.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Without a point of view.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Without a
point of view about it.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Without a point of view,
and that's the beauty of it.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Then it's like, OK, well, when
you don't have a point of view

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:84%
that wrinkles
should develop, it's

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:90%
funny how you get less wrinkles.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: I was just-- exactly.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:90%
You don't have stress about it.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:90%
So you're not fixated on it.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.211 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Exactly.

00:26:50.211 --> 00:26:51.543 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: And that's youthing.

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it can invite.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we have joy
and sadness here.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.327 align:middle line:84%
And on the top of the
head where my thumbs are--

00:26:59.327 --> 00:27:00.660 align:middle line:90%
can you tilt your head forward--

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.201 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:03.726 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: --we have
body and sexuality.

00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:05.056 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Hm.

00:27:05.056 --> 00:27:05.555 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: OK.

00:27:05.555 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:90%
You can lift your head back up.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.318 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: That's what
we were talking about

00:27:08.318 --> 00:27:10.170 align:middle line:84%
before with the abuse
that you experienced.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, when you
had this experience,

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
did it light up and
break that up for you?

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you
were talking about?

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: It did,
and it was actually

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of lightening that
up and breaking it up for me.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And then later I had to use
some of the more, I don't know,

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
in depth Access tools that
really started changing it.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we got out of it

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.480 align:middle line:84%
is a CD that we call "Clearing
the Issues of Abuse."

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And literally, this is
an hour and 45 minutes,

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
or two hour, two
hour and a half CD.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.550 align:middle line:90%
It's on two CDs.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's created more change in
people who've experienced abuse

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:90%
than anything I've ever seen.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Wow.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: And we have
psychotherapists

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.319 align:middle line:84%
who give it to their
clients, so that they

00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:84%
can start getting over
the issues of abuse.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they handle
the other stuff

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:90%
that comes up as they go along.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of an
amazing gift to the world.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at that.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:90%
And I went, wow, you know what?

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
This is very interesting,
because had I not

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.850 align:middle line:84%
experienced the abuse
that I experienced,

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I would not have been
there to help contribute

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.816 align:middle line:84%
to this thing that has been a
gift to a lot of other people.

00:28:13.816 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So one of things I'd
ask all of you out there

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.055 align:middle line:84%
is what are the experiences
that you've had in your life

00:28:19.055 --> 00:28:21.600 align:middle line:84%
that you've been judging
you for even having

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.679 align:middle line:84%
gone through that if you
didn't judge you anymore,

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:28.220 align:middle line:84%
could be a gift in how you could
inspire other people to know

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:90%
that change is possible?

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.794 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So you stop
judging yourself

00:28:32.794 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.550 align:middle line:90%
And notice here.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing joy and
sadness, where these guys are.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Up here, we're doing
body and sexuality.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.341 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you could
imagine-- what do you do?

00:28:45.341 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:84%
What do we do when
we're having a bad day?

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.920 align:middle line:84%
We go-- we put our hand
on our head, right?

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
To activate the
joy and the sadness

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Bars to try to dissipate
what's sticking us

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:84%
about the situation that's
been going on during our day.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So inherently, we try
to do these things.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:84%
But nobody's ever sort of walked
us through point by point,

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:84%
step by step, and gone
hey, you know what?

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Here's how to do it directed.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Now, the reason that
you have both joy and sadness

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.520 align:middle line:84%
touching is because
you're saying

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have
both of those emotions

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.161 align:middle line:84%
and space for both of
those emotions, is OK?

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Now, here's
the interesting thing.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:84%
What happens is when you can
have sadness and not judge it,

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.879 align:middle line:90%
it leads to joy.

00:29:31.879 --> 00:29:33.670 align:middle line:84%
When you can have
sadness and not judge it,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.322 align:middle line:90%
joy can come along a lot faster.

00:29:36.322 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And so what this does
is it dissipates what

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:84%
makes you think you have
to judge the sadness,

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:84%
dissipates what makes you
believe you can't have joy.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Because joy is actually
a natural state

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:84%
for an infinite being,
which we all are.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And this allows you
to start accessing it.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.422 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even
have to think about it.

00:29:53.422 --> 00:29:55.255 align:middle line:84%
The thing I love about
this is it's not, oh,

00:29:55.255 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try
to be happy now.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:59.127 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, I
just feel happier.

00:29:59.127 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.876 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:00.876 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: Because that should
be our natural state.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: I feel completely
different in terms

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:84%
of relaxed and allowing
a flow to happen more

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.269 align:middle line:84%
connected with you in a
completely harmonious place.

00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Cool.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yes.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: I think part of the
beauty of this also is so do I.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Ah.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.831 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: The interesting
thing is when

00:30:22.831 --> 00:30:24.623 align:middle line:84%
you give a session,
you also get a session.

00:30:24.623 --> 00:30:27.081 align:middle line:84%
So there are people out there
that do nothing but run Bars.

00:30:27.081 --> 00:30:28.440 align:middle line:90%
They very seldom receive them.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But they notice that they always
have this sense of connection.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:84%
They always have
this sense of flow.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it's from when
you gift and truly gift,

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:90%
you also receive simultaneously.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: So the natural energy
flow happens between two people

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.290 align:middle line:84%
without trying to
make it happen,

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:49.739 align:middle line:84%
without a forced
healing happening.

00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Without one person
forcing it on the other.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like, hi.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:54.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm here with you.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: You know?

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Totally present.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Completely present.

00:30:59.245 --> 00:30:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I am walking this
planet with you.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:90%
What can I contribute to you?

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And in contributing that to you,
what might change in our world?

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA: Thus the
title of your book,

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:90%
"Being You, Changing the World."

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if we were all
walking around like this,

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:17.860 align:middle line:84%
complete fullness, present
state of love and connection,

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.039 align:middle line:84%
what a better place
this would be.

00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:90%
No kidding, right?

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.611 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:22.302 align:middle line:90%
Worldwide.

00:31:22.302 --> 00:31:22.885 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Truly.

00:31:22.885 --> 00:31:23.885 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Well, thank you.

00:31:23.885 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:90%
You're a blessing to us.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.527 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for showing
this on the air.

00:31:27.527 --> 00:31:29.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time that
you've been able to do this.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Truly.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And you are so welcome.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, there's
a lot more points.

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:90%
There's more to it.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to give
people a gift that they

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.370 align:middle line:90%
could start using right now.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Right now.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: So they can
start changing the things

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.138 align:middle line:84%
in their lives they
want to change.

00:31:44.138 --> 00:31:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start
changing, there's

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.040 align:middle line:84%
this really wonderful
thing that occurs.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a lot
of things in your life,

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're sort of backed up,
and stocked up, and sludged up,

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.077 align:middle line:84%
>>HEER: But there are things
where you're like that.

00:31:57.077 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you've been
wanting to change them.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And they don't change.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
something comes along.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.360 align:middle line:90%
And you sense it changing.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:90%
It gives you hope.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It lets you know,
OK, all is not lost.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.244 align:middle line:90%
I can carry on.

00:32:08.244 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: It's going to be OK.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:10.327 align:middle line:90%
>>HEER: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:10.327 --> 00:32:10.868 align:middle line:90%
>>LISA: Yeah.

00:32:10.868 --> 00:32:12.064 align:middle line:90%
